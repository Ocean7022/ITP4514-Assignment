        "title": "Nearly 450 patients at a Massachusetts hospital may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis",
        "content": "Nearly 450 patients at Salem Hospital in Massachusetts may have been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV due to improper administration of their IV medications, a hospital spokesperson said Thursday. The potential exposures occurred over roughly two years and involved patients who needed an endoscopy, a procedure where doctors use a small camera to look inside the body to detect diseases. The hospital was first made aware of the possible exposures earlier this year and the practice was immediately corrected, according to a statement. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted and we remain committed to delivering high-quality, compassionate health care to our community,\u201d the hospital said. The likelihood that patients were actually infected is \u201cextremely small\u201d and no patients reported infections as of Thursday, said Adam Bagni, the hospital\u2019s director of external communications. Bagni said the hospital is testing people for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, \u201cwhich are standard tests for a potential exposure of this kind,\u201d but did not elaborate further on the nature of the exposure. Potentially exposed patients were notified via the hospital\u2019s online portal, Patient Gateway, and through email. If patients didn\u2019t immediately respond to their notification, the hospital called patients and sent them letters, Bagni said. Patients who were not notified do not need to be worried about exposure, he said. Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for the Tufts Medicine health system, said instances of patients being potentially exposed to bloodborne pathogens due to bad practices in hospitals are \u201cpretty rare.\u201d Health care workers are exposed to these pathogens far more often, she said, because of injuries from needles or other procedural equipment that touches patients\u2019 eyes, noses and mouths. Most hospitals have strict procedures for sanitizing needles, syringes and other hospital equipment before they\u2019re used, and hospitals are held accountable to these standards, Doron said. \u201cEvery three years we have an unannounced survey, and that\u2019s one of the big things that the surveyors are looking for is to make sure that you\u2019re taking all the required steps to prevent the transfer of bloodborne pathogens,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, patients are still exposed to diseases from time to time. In 2018, more than 3,000 patients were at risk of exposure to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV after rusty equipment was used in a New Jersey surgery center. In 2008, up to 63,000 patients were potentially exposed to hepatitis C following \u201cnegligent practices\u201d at two endoscopy clinics in Las Vegas, according to a report from the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine. To avoid exposing patients to diseases like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, health care workers should ensure they never use the same needle and syringe on more than one patient, Doron said. Workers should also avoid placing a cap on a used syringe with a needle in it, she added, so other workers don\u2019t mistakenly believe it\u2019s safe to use. Katie Mogg is an intern at NBC News. ",

        "title": "Child and teen cancer deaths fell 24% in the last 2 decades, CDC says",
        "content": "The rate of child and teen cancer deaths in the U.S. fell 24% from 2001 to 2021, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report looked at death rates for Black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white youths up to 19 years old. Those three groups comprised 92% of all youth cancer deaths in 2021, the report noted. Death rates among children of all ages in those groups dropped between 2001 and 2011. But after 2011, only children 9 and younger saw \"significant\" declines. All races saw cancer death rates fall 15-17% within the first decade, but only death rates among white children continued to drop significantly after 2011. The death rate dropped only slightly for Hispanic youths \u2014 and increased for Black youths \u2014 between 2011 and 2021. By 2021, the report noted, the rate for white youths was 19-20% lower than for their Black and Hispanic peers. The report uses data from the National Vital Statistics System, which tracks death certificate information from across the U.S. The authors looked specifically at death certificates of patients under 20 years of age who died from the most common forms of cancer in that age group: leukemia, brain cancer and a category of bone cancer called \u201cbone and articular cartilage cancer.\u201d \u201cThe overall message is good news,\u201d said Sally Curtin, a CDC statistician and the lead author of the report. Death rates \u201cdeclined across the board: all the five-year age groups, male, female, and all the race groups,\u201d she said. Pediatric oncologists say the overall decline could be explained by advancements in treatments for certain cancers. Though death rates from childhood cancers continue to drop, diagnoses have been swelling for more than a decade in the U.S. The rate of leukemia diagnoses rose the fastest of all cancers from 1998 to 2018, according to a 2019 study. Leukemia remains the most common cancer in children, accounting for almost 1 in 3 pediatric cancer diagnoses, according to the American Cancer Society.  But brain cancer was the most common cause of cancer deaths among youths in 2021, according to the CDC report. Death rates for brain cancer that year were 23% higher than for leukemia, and more than double the rate for bone and articular cartilage cancer.  Death rates among children and teenagers due to leukemia declined 47% between 2001 and 2021, the CDC found. Dr. Stephen Skapek, medical director of the Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children\u2019s Health, said advancements in immunotherapy treatments \u2014 which use the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer \u2014 could explain the drop in leukemia deaths, particularly among young children.  He pointed to one \u201cgame-changing\u201d treatment in particular, an immunotherapy called Kymriah from the pharmaceutical company Novartis. To make the treatment, doctors remove some of a patient\u2019s white blood cells, then modify them in a lab so they express a protein that attacks the cancer. The cells are then delivered back to the patient\u2019s body via an infusion. Kymriah was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 to treat leukemia in children and young adults.  \u201cThose types of immunotherapies have been remarkably effective for childhood leukemias,\u201d Skapek said. But they haven\u2019t had the same impact in teenagers, nor has the scientific community seen the same advancements in treatments for brain or bone and articular cartilage cancers, he added.  \u201cThat could be why the survival rates in older age groups, or in some of the diseases like brain tumors and bone and articular cartilage cancer tumors, haven\u2019t improved,\u201d he said. Differing death rates among white, Black and Hispanic children may also be explained, in part, by lack of access to cutting-edge cancer treatments or treatment centers, said Dr. Paolo Boffetta, associate director of population sciences at the Stony Brook Cancer Center.  \u201cPatients should really go to highly specialized pediatric cancer hospitals,\u201d he said.  But \u201cclearly there is an issue of access to effective treatment in African American children with cancer\u201d compared to white children with the disease, he added. Skapek said that in his state of Texas, some children live hours away from major medical centers. Kymriah's one-time single treatment can also cost $475,000 without insurance, so it is not affordable for many. \u201cTrying to better understand those barriers, or what people call \u2018social determinants of health,\u2019 in childhood cancer patients is a really important area of research,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Advances in childhood cancer stall for Black and Latino children",
        "content": "Advances in childhood cancer are a success story in modern medicine. But in the past decade, those strides have stalled for Black and Hispanic youth, opening a gap in death rates, according to a new report published Thursday. Childhood cancers are rare and treatments have improved drastically in recent decades, saving lives. Death rates were about the same for Black, Hispanic and white children in 2001, and all went lower during the next decade. But over the next 10 years, only the rate for white children dipped a little lower. \u201cYou can have the most sophisticated scientific advances, but if we can\u2019t deliver them into every community in the same way, then we have not met our goal as a nation,\u201d said Dr. Sharon Castellino, a pediatric cancer specialist at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, who had no role in the new report. She said the complexity of new cancers treatments such as gene therapy, which can cure some children with leukemia, can burden families and be an impediment to getting care. \u201cYou need at least one parent to quit their job and be there 24/7, and then figure out the situation for the rest of their children,\u201d Castellino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that families don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d More social workers are needed to help families file paperwork to get job-protected leave and make sure the child\u2019s health insurance is current and doesn\u2019t lapse. The overall cancer death rate for children and teenagers in the U.S. declined 24% over the two decades, from 2.75 to 2.10 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The 2021 rate per 10,000 was 2.38 for Black youth, 2.36 for Hispanics and 1.99 for whites. Nearly incurable 50 years ago, childhood cancer now is survivable for most patients, especially those with leukemia. The leading cause of cancer deaths in kids is now brain cancer, replacing leukemia. Each year in the U.S. about 15,000 children and teens are diagnosed with cancer. More than 85% live for at least five years. The improved survival stems from research collaboration among more than 200 hospitals, said Dr. Paula Aristizabal of the University of California, San Diego. At Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, She is trying to include more Hispanic children, who are underrepresented in research. \u201cEquity means that we provide support that is tailored to each family,\u201d Aristizabal said. The National Cancer Institute is working to gather data from every childhood cancer patient with the goal of linking each child to state-of-the-art care. The effort could improve equity, said Dr. Emily Tonorezos, who leads the institute\u2019s work on cancer survivorship. The CDC\u2019s report is \u201cupsetting and discouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives us a roadmap for where we need to go next.\u201d   ",

        "title": "Torn ACLs may heal with therapy instead of surgery, though some surgeons aren\u2019t convinced",
        "content": "ACL tears are one of the most common and debilitating knee injuries that can hobble both professional and amateur athletes. It\u2019s long been thought that a torn ACL, or anterior cruciate ligament, has limited ability to heal on its own and requires surgery.  Recent research suggests that a nonsurgical treatment, including physical therapy, could be as effective, sparking controversy among surgeons who perform dozens of ACL reconstructions every year. The study, published in June in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that 90% of ACL tears in 80 participants showed signs of healing on an MRI after they followed a new bracing protocol. Many of the patients, mostly competitive or recreational athletes, also reported good knee stability and function, and were able to return to their sport a year later. Patients wore a brace for a month that kept their knees at a 90 degree angle: a position that keeps the torn ends of the ACL closest together, increasing the likelihood they fuse, said Stephanie Filbay, lead author of the study and senior research associate with the Center for Health, Exercise and Sports Medicine at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Over the next two months, patients underwent physical therapy as their braces were slowly adjusted to increase the range of motion. Braces were removed around the three-month mark. MRIs performed then, and again at six months, revealed that most ACLs repaired themselves. \u201cWe have now braced over 430 patients in clinical practice, with similar high rates of ACL healing and excellent patient outcomes,\u201d Filbay wrote in an email.  Running diagonally in the middle of the knee, the ACL helps maintain rotational stability and prevents the shinbone (tibia) from slipping in front of the thigh bone (femur). Sharp changes in direction, quick stops or direct hits \u2014 all common movements in sports such as soccer, basketball, skiing and football \u2014 can slightly tear the ligament or snap it in two. About 100,000 to 200,000 people suffer a torn ACL each year in the United States, experts estimate. The ACL is one of the most commonly injured ligaments in the knee, and often occurs along with damage to other parts of the knee like the meniscus, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Surgery is almost always recommended to repair a torn ACL, which involves replacing the ligament with a new one called a graft made of tissue from a patient\u2019s kneecap tendons or hamstrings, or from a donor. Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lutul Farrow, director of clinical operations for sports medicine with the Cleveland Clinic, said surgery can reliably get people back to their activities at full function in a short amount of time with smaller risks of future injury. He wasn't part of the new study. Yet, surgery can have complications. Some may experience kneecap pain, chronic instability or stiffness after surgery, the AAOS says. While rare, more serious complications can include infection, blood clots and numbness. Although the new study didn\u2019t follow up with patients long term, researchers analyzed the results of a separate trial from 2022 including 120 ACL tears. They found that after two years, a third of injuries in people who were randomly selected to undergo physical therapy showed signs of healing on an MRI. \u201cThis study could be a game changer,\u201d said Dr. Lyle Micheli, an orthopedic surgeon at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new research.  Keeping patients\u2019 injured knees at 90 degrees immobilizes torn ACLs in a way that \u201cmaximizes\u201d healing, he said, similar to stabilizing broken and fractured bones inside a cast. The research also suggests that nonoperative treatment could be a viable option for people who don\u2019t play professional or competitive sports or can\u2019t get surgery because of financial or health complications, he said.  Dr. Robert Sallis, director, sports medicine fellowship at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center, argues that it takes several weeks for stiffness and swelling in the injured knee to subside before patients can safely undergo surgery anyway \u2014 so the idea of waiting and bracing doesn\u2019t hurt. \u201cACL surgery has a big role in managing ACL tears, but too often the nonoperative treatment is ignored,\u201d said Sallis, who is also chief medical officer for the Major League Soccer team Los Angeles FC. Dr. Maryam Saidy, a 40-year-old colorectal surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in California, wasn\u2019t offered an alternative to surgery when she tore her ACL in 2008 during a recreational basketball game. The operation left her with scar tissue that prevented the full range of motion, early arthritis and a permanent limp.  It took two years of physical therapy before she could play basketball again.  About a decade later, Saidy tore the same ACL again in January. This time, two surgeons suggested physical therapy as treatment. In three months, she was back on the court.   \u201cIt was a lot easier,\u201d the second time around, she said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy with how life is right now with my knee.\u201d  More than half of the people who tear their ACLs develop osteoarthritis \u2014 when cartilage within a joint breaks down and causes pain, stiffness and swelling.  ACL reconstruction has long been thought to reduce risks of developing the condition, but more recent research shows that about 50% of patients who have surgery still develop it within 12 to 14 years.  \u201cReconstruction doesn\u2019t save you from that fate,\u201d Sallis said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to have surgery, shouldn\u2019t you consider other options, especially if the outcome is the same?\u201d While some experts agree that not all torn ACLs require surgery, others aren\u2019t convinced that bracing injured knees will lead to the long-term stability needed to prevent further injury. Cleveland Clinic's Farrow said keeping the knee in a limited position for months can be inconvenient for daily activities such as going to school or work. It takes about a year, on average, to safely return to sports after tearing the ACL, regardless if the person got surgery or not, experts say. Farrow questioned how stable a torn ACL that healed on its own would be, compared to a reconstructed one. An unstable knee could contribute to a potential tear of the meniscus \u2014 the shock-absorbing cushion of cartilage in the knee \u2014 which increases risks of osteoarthritis. ACL reconstruction can protect the meniscus from injury, doctors say.  A weak knee can also lead to another ACL tear. In fact, 11 patients (14%) in the new study re-injured their ACL.  However, Filbay said, she\u2019s working with more than 60 people who have had surgery on one knee and completed the bracing protocol on the other. Most of these patients, she said, felt that recovery after bracing \u201cwas faster, return to sport was easier, and their knee felt better\u201d compared to recovery post surgery.  Still, some experts think the risks are not worth the benefits. \u201cIf a collegiate athlete has a complete tear and you send them back to sports without a surgery, it\u2019s close to malpractice,\u201d Farrow said.   Dr. Riley Williams, head team orthopedic surgeon for the Brooklyn Nets who also works with the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said people may not know how well the treatment worked until they return to the sport. \"If it didn\u2019t, then that would have a catastrophic effect on the function,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Alabama woman born with two uteri is expecting babies in both",
        "content": "An Alabama woman is expecting two babies from two technically separate pregnancies. Kelsey Hatcher was born with two uteri, each with its own cervix \u2014 a condition known as uterine didelphys. She is expecting two baby girls, one in each uterus, with an official due date on Christmas Day, NBC affiliate WVTM of Birmingham reported. When Hatcher\u2019s first ultrasound appointment last spring revealed her condition, her husband, Caleb, almost didn\u2019t believe her, she told WVTM. \u201cHe said, 'You\u2019re lying.' I said, 'No, I\u2019m not,'\u201d said Hatcher, who already has three children, ages 7, 4 and 2. She said the new babies will be her last ones. Only about 3 in 1,000 women are born with two uteri, and the chances of being pregnant in both are at least 1 in a million, said Dr. Richard Davis, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Alabama Hospital. Davis is consulting Hatcher through her pregnancy and has assisted with most of her ultrasounds. \"I've delivered several women that have a double uterus, and most of the time they have done well, but I've never delivered one with twins in each horn, for sure,\" Davis said. The babies, which are growing healthily, come from separate eggs and won\u2019t be identical, so Davis suggested the term \"fraternal twins\" might be a more accurate way to describe them. Hatcher's pregnancy is classified as high-risk because it will require more care providers and contingency plans. That includes the high chance that each uterus starts contractions at different times, meaning the sisters could be born hours or days apart. Hatcher plans for a natural birth to lessen her recovery time, but there could be complications regardless of the method she chooses, Davis said. \u201cThe C-section is a little more risky than usual, because you have to make an incision in each uterus,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s two incisions and more blood loss.\u201d For a vaginal delivery, concerns would be around ensuring that the babies look safe during labor and have normal fetal heart rates, he said. For now, Hatcher will need to get an ultrasound every week to monitor the conditions of her babies. Natalie Kainz is a news associate for NBC News. ",

        "title": "FTC warns influencers over 'inadequate' disclosures of artificial sweetener promotions",
        "content": "A dozen social media influencers and two trade associations received warnings from the Federal Trade Commission on Monday for endorsing the safety of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, or for promoting the consumption of products containing sugar. By using health and diet creators, many of whom have large platforms on Instagram and TikTok, to market these products without adequately disclosing their connection to the advertiser, the American Beverage Association and the Canadian Sugar Institute may have violated FTC rules, according to warning letters the commission sent the two groups. \u201cConsumers should be able to notice the disclosure easily, and not have to look for it,\u201d said the letters, which the FTC shared in a news release. That means that in a promotional TikTok video or Instagram reel, the disclosure should be made audible in the video itself as well as visible in the text description. The rule applies to paid sponsorships, promotions in exchange for free products, and in cases of any business or familial relationships. None of the posts targeted by the FTC included any disclosures in the videos themselves, with some creators failing entirely to indicate their material connection to the beverage association anywhere in the post. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for any trade group to hire influencers to tout its members\u2019 products and fail to ensure that the influencers come clean about that relationship,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly true for health and safety claims about sugar and aspartame, especially when made by registered dieticians and others upon whom people rely for advice about what to eat and drink.\u201d Some in-text disclosures labeling a post as \u201c#sponsored\u201d or an \u201c#ad\u201d buried those hashtags multiple lines down in the post description, the letters stated, making them insufficiently clear to the average scroller \u2014 especially because users must click to open the full post when they have lengthier descriptions. Using the in-app \u201cPaid partnership\u201d disclosure labels is also not enough when used alone, according to the FTC, because viewers may too easily miss them. The FTC\u2019s warnings fall in line with its recently revised advertising guides, published in June, addressing \u201cdeceptive\u201d reviews and endorsements. In its letters involving the beverage association, the FTC laid out concerns about TikTok and Instagram posts by influencers \u2014 some who are dietitians \u2014 who have built followings online in large part for giving health advice.  Those listed in the letter include: Valerie Agyeman, Nichole Andrews, Leslie Bonci, Keri Gans, Stephanie Grasso, Cara Harbstreet, Andrea Miller, Idrees Mughal, Adam Pecoraro and Mary Ellen Phipps. The FTC said it also examined Instagram videos by Jenn Messina and Lindsay Pleskot in its research into CSI. The influencers each have followings that range from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand followers. Two of them \u2014 Grasso and Mughal \u2014 have more than 1 million each.  Harbstreet, a dietitian with about 38,500 TikTok followers, wrote in a statement to NBC News that she shares the FTC\u2019s goal of transparent disclosure and protecting audiences from disinformation, and that she plans to ensure her compliance with its updated guidelines. \u201cConflicts of interest are not something I take lightly and I have stringent standards in place to determine which partners I work with. One of those many considerations is the quality of the science,\u201d Harbstreet wrote. \u201cIn this case, I stand behind what the evidence currently indicates regarding the safety of aspartame. This is supported by numerous domestic and international health organizations and food safety review committees.\u201d NBC News has reached out to the other influencers who were named in the letter for comment. They did not immediately respond Wednesday. The Canadian Sugar Institute did not immediately respond with a comment Wednesday. A spokesperson for the American Beverage Association wrote in an email statement that the association appreciates the FTC\u2019s guidance and will continue its \u201congoing commitment\u201d to disclose its relationships with dietitians. \u201cWe took proactive, prudent and meticulous steps to be transparent about our partnership with credible experts who spoke to the science behind the safety of aspartame and the FDA\u2019s determination that it is safe,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cImportantly, no question has been raised about the substance of these posts.\u201d Both the trade associations, as well as each of the influencers involved, are facing possible civil penalties of up to $50,120 per violation. Each recipient has 15 working days to tell FTC what they have done or will do to address the agency\u2019s concerns, according to the letters.

        "title": "Disease runs rampant in Gaza as clean water runs out",
        "content": "As clean water in Gaza runs out, a long-expected health crisis has surged in recent days: a steep increase in gastrointestinal diseases and other illnesses tied to poor sanitation. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization reported that more than 44,000 cases of diarrhea had been documented in Gaza since mid-October \u2014 a dramatic increase compared to previous years. Last week, the WHO said that more than half of those cases were among children under age 5. In 2021 and 2022, Gaza averaged 2,000 cases a month of diarrhea among young kids. Dr. Ahmed Moghrabi, the head of plastic surgery at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said he has seen increases in gastrointestinal illnesses. He and his children have been personally affected. It took four or five days, he said, to recover from the bouts of diarrhea. The illnesses, combined with overcrowded hospitals, a scarcity of food and other daily traumas, is \"a nightmare,\" Moghrabi told NBC News in a WhatsApp voice note. \"We are facing many difficulties.\" The exact cause of the gastrointestinal illnesses is unknown; it is impossible to do laboratory testing. But when clean water is unavailable, people are forced to drink and cook with tainted water, which is more likely to harbor bacteria that can lead to intestinal diseases, such as dysentery and cholera. \"People are resorting to coping mechanisms that are dangerous,\" said Sean Carroll, president and chief executive of Anera, a nongovernmental organization that provides humanitarian aid to the Middle East, including Gaza. \"They're drinking water that they shouldn't drink.\"  The situation was expected to worsen Wednesday, as there is no longer enough fuel to power many of the water and sanitation facilities. \"As of 15 November, public water and sanitation services will start shutting down,\" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, said in an online statement. The shutdown will cause \"environmental hazards with around 400 tons of solid waste per day accumulated in all [refugee] camps,\" the U.N. group said. \"This will impose serious threats to public health, with a high risk of water contamination and disease outbreak.\" According to global health agencies, including the World Health Organization, people need a minimum of 15 liters of clean water (about 4 gallons) a day to meet basic needs, including drinking, cooking and cleaning. (The average person in the United States uses well over 300 liters a day, or nearly 80 gallons.) People living in Gaza were already using less than 15 liters before Israel cut off water, electricity and fuel to the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Carroll said. \"The situation has been dire for a while,\" he said. \"Now it's actually getting to the point where people will not have water at all.\" \"Many people will be sick and die simply from loss of fluids,\" said May Chu, a professor with the Colorado School of Public Health and interim director of the Center for Global Health at C.U. Anschutz in Denver. Anera, the NGO, installed a water filtration system in Gaza run by solar energy, but the clean water it can provide is \"literally a drop in the bucket\" of what Gazans need, Carroll said. He has 12 workers in Gaza delivering meals and trying to clean shelters. \"But without fuel and some kind of access to clean or at least safer water, there's no way to keep up with it,\" Carroll said. \"If there's no water, you can't really clean. And the cleaning you can do doesn't take away the danger of disease spread.\" Carroll said he has heard reports that people are actively avoiding eating food, despite their hunger. \"The sanitary conditions are so horrendous,\" he said, \"they don't want to go to the bathroom.\" Other illnesses have also begun to ramp up in overcrowded shelters full of people who have had to flee their homes. On Wednesday, the WHO said there had been approximately 72,000 cases of acute respiratory infections and 808 cases of chickenpox in Gaza within the past month. What's more, there have been \"close to 14,200 skin diseases, scabies and lice,\" Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO's representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said during a briefing Wednesday. Scabies, an itchy rash caused by tiny mites, is \"one of those things that no one talks about because it doesn't kill, but it's really annoying,\" said Dr. Paul Spiegel, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. \"When you have a lack of water and soap, scabies becomes extremely common. You're not able to wash your bedding or your clothes,\" Spiegel said. \"It's incredibly itchy. When your life is already pretty overwhelming, it's really rough.\" The lack of clean water and basic hygiene is concerning to Dr. Adam Levine, chief of global emergency medicine at the Brown University Alpert Medical School and School of Public Health, because they're \"tied to so many different health conditions,\" he said, including diarrheal disease, and skin and respiratory infections. \"Water, sanitation and hygiene are one of the primary priorities of any humanitarian response,\" Levine said, \"because it's such a basic need that leads to so many downstream consequences.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "Browns QB Deshaun Watson sidelined by season-ending shoulder surgery after injury against the Ravens",
        "content": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson will miss the rest of the season after surgeons repair his injured right shoulder, the club announced Wednesday. Watson told team doctors he felt pain in his throwing shoulder after Sunday's dramatic 33-31 come-from-behind victory over the Baltimore Ravens. An MRI scan revealed \"a displaced fracture to the glenoid,\" and \"it has been determined that this injury will require immediate surgical repair to avoid further structural damage,\" the team said. Watson arrived in Cleveland ahead of last season following his trade from the Houston Texans, which was prompted by sexual misconduct allegations against him. He missed the first 11 games of last season after he and the NFL agreed to the penalty, officials said, for his \u201csexualized contact\u201d with massage therapists. The Browns are off to a surprising 6-3 start, riding one of the stingiest defensive units in football. Cleveland's defense is allowing an NFL-best 242.7 yards per game. The team's scoring defense, 18.9 points per game, is sixth best. The season-ending injury came while Watson was playing one of his best games in a Browns uniform. \"We're disappointed for him,\" general manager Andrew Berry told reporters. \"Any time you lose any player to a season-ending injury, particularly your starting quarterback, it's disappointing.\" Watson, 28, has yet to put up the dazzling numbers in Cleveland that he posted in Houston. In his last season leading the Texans in 2020, he threw for a league-high 4,823 yards in 16 games, to go along with 33 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. In his 12-game Browns career, Watson has thrown for a modest 2,217 yards, 14 touchdowns and nine picks. Berry said he doesn't consider the trade and the contract extension for Watson failures. \"We see him every day in terms of his performance on the field, his preparation, his physical and mental toughness,\" Berry said. \"We really do feel great about that position for us moving forward with him.\" Backup quarterback P.J. Walker has started three games this year, helping Cleveland to victories over the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers. David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Global decline in male fertility linked to common pesticides",
        "content": "A prolonged decline in male fertility in the form of sperm concentrations appears to be connected to the use of pesticides, according to a study published Wednesday. Researchers compiled, rated and reviewed the results of 25 studies of certain pesticides and male fertility and found that men who had been exposed to certain classes of pesticides had significantly lower sperm concentrations. The study, published Wednesday in Environmental Health Perspectives, included data from more than 1,700 men and spanned several decades.    \u201cNo matter how we looked at the analysis and results, we saw a persistent association between increasing levels of insecticide and decreases in sperm concentration,\u201d said study author Melissa Perry, who is an environmental epidemiologist and the dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University. \u201cI would hope this study would get the attention of regulators seeking to make decisions to keep the public safe from inadvertent, unplanned impacts of insecticides.\u201d  For decades, scientists have been trying to untangle puzzling questions over male fertility. Sperm concentrations are one of several factors that are a useful indicator. A report last year found that sperm counts were falling in every region of the globe and the pace of that decline was accelerating.  \u201cThere\u2019s been some pretty, I\u2019d say, convincing and sort of scary data on measures of male fertility over the previous 50-70 years, whatever it might be, from different places around the world suggesting sperm concentration is on decline and not just a little bit,\u201d said John Meeker, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who was not involved in either of the recent studies. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning.\u201d  Scientists have long suspected changes to the environment could be contributing, and they\u2019ve been probing the role of pesticides for decades in studies of animals and in human epidemiology research.  The new analysis focuses on two groups of chemicals \u2014 organophosphates and some carbamates \u2014 that are commonly used in insecticides. The researchers looked at data collected from groups of people with exposures to pesticides and others who were not. Most, but not all, of the research centered on exposures in the workplace. The researchers controlled for outside factors that could contribute to lower sperm counts like smoking and age.  \u201cIt was very well done, very carefully done, very comprehensive,\u201d Meeker said.  Perry said researchers aren\u2019t sure how pesticides are affecting sperm concentrations and more research will be needed.  It\u2019s likely that pesticides are one of many environmental factors that could be contributing to a decline in sperm concentrations.  \u201cThe more you study something, the more complicated it seems to get, especially when it comes to biology and the human body,\u201d Meeker said. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly pointing out various chemicals or classes of chemicals we think could be harmful to something like reproductive health, but as far as a single smoking gun, I haven\u2019t seen anything to that extent.\u201d  The trend of sperm concentration declines has been widely observed in studies around the world, but it\u2019s a complicated topic and some scientists still have reservations. Sperm are notoriously difficult to count and the technology to do so has changed over the years. There are many confounding factors that can affect male fertility, including age, obesity and opioid use, to name a few.  Sperm concentrations are one important data point to consider, but other factors \u2014 like how sperm are shaped and how they swim \u2014 are also critical to male fertility.  Perry said she hopes agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency begin to factor the impact of chemicals and pesticides on reproductive health in their assessments.  \u201cGiven the body of evidence and these consistent findings, it\u2019s time to proactively reduce these insecticide exposures for men wanting to have families,\u201d Perry said.

        "title": "Maria Menounos reveals a pancreatic cancer symptom she noticed a year before diagnosis",
        "content": "Maria Menounos predicted there was something wrong with her pancreas during an episode of her podcast months before her pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The 45-year-old television personality was diagnosed with a rare type of pancreatic cancer, a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, in January and had it removed the following month. After she went public with her diagnosis, \u201cI had a viewer reach out to me and say, you predicted this last April (2022) on your show. I went back ... and I did,\u201d Menounos told \"TODAY\" co-anchor Hoda Kotb during a new episode of Kotb\u2019s podcast, \u201cMaking Space.\u201d Leading up to her diagnosis, Menounos said, she had sensed something was wrong for many months and discussed it on her own podcast, \u201cHeal Squad.\u201d \u201cFor at least a year and a half or so, I looked like I swallowed a basketball,\u201d she recalled to Kotb. \u201cI\u2019ve been on fitness covers my whole career, flat washboard abs. Never had that. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Menounos said she was tested for celiac disease but got no answers. \u201cIn March 2022, I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy, trying to get to the root of what\u2019s happening. ... didn\u2019t find the source. That was it,\u201d said Menounos. \u201cI go, wait guys, the investigation doesn\u2019t stop. We\u2019re still trying to figure out what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cI kept taking pictures of (my bloating) because I was trying to eliminate things from (my) diet to see if there was a difference,\u201d she continued. \u201cI said, something\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019m going to keep investigating until I find it.\u201d The next month, April 2022, the \u201cHeal Squad\u201d episode that the viewer pointed out aired. It was focused on how to better tune into your body, and Menounos shared with listeners that she was struck by the idea that her pancreas was the source of the problem. \u201c(I said), \u2018I think something\u2019s wrong with my pancreas,\u201d which was followed by \u201ca whole discussion about the pancreas,\u201d she told Kotb about the episode. \u201cSo random. And that was two months before I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.\u201d Menounos said she was in disbelief when she learned she had diabetes in June 2022. \u201cFirst thing I (said) is, \u2018I don\u2019t have this.\u2019 ... At 43 years old or whatever ... there\u2019s no reason for me to get Type 1 diabetes.\u201d (Research shows new onset of diabetes, especially in patients older than 50, can be a sign of pancreatic cancer.) In the fall of 2022, Menounos\u2019 symptoms worsened significantly. \u201cI started having these weird abdominal pains that were super strong. I was on a plane and I thought I was going to die,\u201d she told Kotb, adding that she chalked it up to a gluten sensitivity from a farro salad she was eating at the time. In November 2022, the excruciating abdominal pains came back, this time coupled with diarrhea, which lasted for a month, Menounos previously told TODAY.com. \u201cI can\u2019t lay down, I can\u2019t sit up \u2014 I go to the hospital and they do a CT scan,\u201d she said. In addition to a CT scan, Menounos got stool and blood tests, all of which had \u201cunremarkable\u201d results. \u201cThey said everything\u2019s fine,\u201d but the abdominal pain persisted, she said. Finally, in December 2022, Menounos got a full-body MRI, which revealed a mass on her pancreas. A biopsy confirmed it was a stage 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor \u2014 a rare and less aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. Menounos said she thought she was a \u201cgoner\u201d upon hearing her diagnosis, but that she was successfully treated with surgery. In addition to the tumor, doctors removed part of her pancreas, her spleen, a fibroid and 17 lymph nodes. The new mom told Kotb that she is officially cancer-free. In June, Menounos and her husband Keven Undergaro welcomed their first child together via surrogate, a baby girl named Athena. The most common type of pancreatic cancer, adenocarcinoma, usually doesn\u2019t have symptoms in early stages, but they may include abdominal pain and jaundice, back pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, dark urine, light-colored stools and itchy skin, per the National Cancer Institute. November is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month \u2014 to help spread awareness, Menounos teamed up with PanCAN to star in a public service announcement about the importance of early detection. \u201cI really encourage anybody who\u2019s having any consistent pain or symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, gas or constipation to look deeper,\u201d Menounos previously told TODAY.com. \u201cA lot of people just want to shush their bodies and go back to work and go back to life and pretend it\u2019s not happening. I\u2019ve been there.\u201d Menounos wants others to listen to their bodies and advocate for their health, too. \u201cI have learned that we have to be the CEO of our health. We have to use our own internal guidance, we have to do our own homework, we have to push,\u201d she told Kotb. \u201cYou can\u2019t just listen to somebody else tell you what\u2019s happening in your body,\u201d she added. \u201cIf the pain persists ... you have to keep fighting.\u201d ",

        "title": "Should you get your Covid and flu shots at the same time? New research suggests yes",
        "content": "Covid and flu shots can be safely given at the same time, and according to a small new study, doing so may even confer benefits. Findings presented Monday at the Vaccines Summit Boston, an annual scientific conference, suggest that giving Covid and flu shots together could produce a stronger antibody response against the coronavirus than administering the vaccines separately. The study measured the antibody levels of 42 health care workers in Massachusetts who were vaccinated last fall. Twelve of the participants received a bivalent Covid booster and seasonal influenza shot on the same day. Another 30 received the shots on different days within the span of a month.  Three to four weeks after people got their Covid boosters, those who had received the flu shot at the same time had higher levels of IgG1, an antibody involved in the body's front-line defense against Covid. The results held true six months later, suggesting that co-administering the vaccines could improve long-term protection. \u201cWe showed that the Covid antibody responses were higher and more durable if the Covid and flu vaccines were given on the same day,\u201d said Susanna Barouch, the study\u2019s lead author and an intern at the Ragon Institute's Systems Serology Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The research is undergoing peer review and has not been published in a scientific journal. Ryan McNamara, the lab's director and senior author on the study, said the findings still need to be replicated in a larger group of volunteers, but he felt it was useful to share the results right away. In September, the findings were posted to the preprint server BioRxiv. \"We thought that these findings were very important for immediate public health decision making,\" McNamara said. He expects the results to apply to this year\u2019s updated Covid vaccines, he added, though his team plans to explore that further. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting Covid and flu vaccines at the same appointment if people are eligible for both shots at once. But that recommendation is based on convenience rather than efficacy, said Dr. Judith O\u2019Donnell, chief of infectious diseases at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. \u201cWe probably would want to see this kind of data replicated using the current 2023 vaccines to really know with 100% certainty how giving those together might enhance immunity or not,\u201d she said. McNamara said it's still unclear why getting Covid and flu shots together might result in stronger, more lasting protection. One theory, he said, is that most people's bodies are already primed to produce Covid antibodies because they've been vaccinated or exposed to the virus before. Giving two vaccines at once could awaken this immune response to a greater extent than one shot alone, which may lead to more a robust antibody response, he said. \"Your immune system is a highly tuned army and it\u2019s basically calling all the special forces at the same time,\" said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth in Colorado, who was not involved in the research. But that strong immune response could also induce greater side effects, she added. In a 2022 study, getting a Covid booster and flu shot together was associated with an 8% to 11% higher rate of self-reported side effects like fatigue, headache and muscle pain in the week after vaccination compared to getting a Covid booster alone. An October analysis from the Food and Drug Administration, which has not been peer-reviewed, also identified a slightly elevated risk of stroke among people ages 85 and up who had received a high-dose flu shot at the same time as a bivalent Covid vaccine. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, said it's possible that \"we're starting to see the immune system revved up so much that we're seeing these inflammatory conditions like stroke in this select age group.\" But Barron noted that many older people have underlying health conditions that independently increase their risk of stroke, and several other studies have not identified the same safety concern with co-administering Covid and flu shots. \"The benefit of getting the shots and knowing that you have that protection will outweigh any of these potential risks,\" she said. The CDC recommends getting a flu shot by the end of October. As of Monday, however, less than 33% of children and less than 35% of adults in the U.S. had gotten their flu shots, according to CDC data. Uptake of Covid shots is even lower this year: 5% of children and 14% of adults have received the updated Covid vaccine. O\u2019Donnell said it\u2019s reasonable for people to want to space out their shots to lower the risk of side effects. While the CDC does not recommend a certain waiting period between vaccines, O\u2019Donnell suggested for people who prefer to space them out, separating the shots by a couple weeks. But infectious disease experts widely agreed that co-administration may be the best option at this point, since the vaccines take two weeks to be fully effective and both Covid and flu are spreading in the U.S. Covid hospital admissions fell 8% nationally the week ending Nov. 4, but they\u2019re rising in many individual counties. Flu-related hospital admissions also rose 20% in that time, while the number of positive flu tests rose 50%. \"We've been seeing increases in Covid and now we're seeing increases in flu,\" Barron said. \"There\u2019s really no value in saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll wait another week,\u2019 because that\u2019s another week where, whichever vaccine you didn\u2019t get, you\u2019re now potentially vulnerable.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Giving birth in Gaza: 'My girl came to the world broken'",
        "content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 Ahlam is younger than this war. The tiny Gazan was born prematurely Nov. 7, weighing just 2.75 pounds. She has spent most of her short life in an incubator in the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza. The neonatal ward where she\u2019s being cared for is filled with cries of newborns, the beep of the medical machines that keep them alive, and the nearby thunder of Israeli airstrikes. Ahlam is one of around 180 children being born every day in Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, mothers-to-be who conceived their children at a time of relative peace but are now giving birth amid the chaos of war.  \u201cThe situation is extremely horrible. There\u2019s no humanity. There\u2019s no humanity for people, for patients and for everyone,\u201d Dr. Shireen Abed, a neonatal specialist in Gaza, told NBC News in a voice note on WhatsApp.  Hind Shamlakh, 32, almost gave birth under the rubble.  Originally from Gaza City, her family headed south to Deir al-Balah to escape the fighting. They were staying on the floor of a stranger\u2019s home when the house was blown apart by an airstrike, she said. She and her young son were dug out of the debris and taken to a shelter in a nearby school. She soon began to feel acute pain.  \u201cThey found that I had blood pressure due to the amount of rubble that was on me, and the air from the bombing caused damage to me,\u201d Hind said. Doctors delivered her daughter, Sham, in an emergency cesarean section Oct. 29. The baby was born with a broken leg from the airstrike, she said.   \u201cThank God, we made it peacefully, but my girl came to the world broken,\u201d she said.  The mothers and newborns at Nasser Hospital are relatively fortunate, compared to those 14 miles north at Al-Shifa, the main hospital in the Gaza Strip. Fighting is raging in the streets around Al-Shifa and the World Health Organization on Sunday declared it was \u201cnot functioning as a hospital anymore\u201d because of the lack of electricity, running water and food. On Tuesday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report there is now just one functioning hospital remaining in northern Gaza. Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict With no power for incubators, premature babies at Al-Shifa were individually wrapped in blankets and then placed huddled together in a desperate effort to keep them warm. At least three have died already, according to the hospital. Israel\u2019s military said Tuesday that it was offering mobile incubators to evacuate the newborns to safety but that the offer had not been accepted. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, said it was prepared to evacuate the babies to Israel or Egypt to save their lives.  Abed said the newborns would not survive unless a solution was found immediately. \u201cWe expect all to die because they don\u2019t have water to prepare milk for them. They don\u2019t have electricity to provide them with warmth,\u201d she told NBC News in a voice note. Gaza is particularly dangerous for both new mothers and their children because there is nowhere to escape, said Andrew Weeks, a professor of international maternal health care at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. \u201cPeople can\u2019t escape and they\u2019re trapped in a place in a very small area, which is then being intensely bombed, in which supplies have been cut off, electricity has been cut off,\u201d said Weeks, who has studied the risks of war for pregnant women.  Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis still has power and water, but staff said they were still facing shortages of basic medical supplies. They were overwhelmed by the number of new patients arriving at the hospital after fleeing south from Gaza City. Dr. Maher Khamis Sirwana, an obstetrician, said his staff members were delivering twice as many babies as usual \u2014 with more than 800 born at the hospital since Oct. 7, compared to the roughly 400 a month he would expect normally. High levels of stress during pregnancy can lead to serious medical conditions such as high blood pressure and preterm birth, experts say. \u201cThis war is leading to many cases where women are delivering prematurely at seven months or eight months,\u201d Sirwana said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have enough room because we don\u2019t have enough oxygen.\u201d  Sirwana was standing at the bedside of Razan Ghazali, who had given birth prematurely just hours earlier. Her tiny daughter lay beside her, not yet named and her face still covered in pale amniotic fluid. Razan, 25, said she had walked for miles in one of the long lines of Palestinian civilians trying to flee Gaza City. \u201cI saw the Israeli tanks on the way. I was terrified. I was tired. And that\u2019s why I delivered my baby prematurely,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mercy from God that the girl and I are in good health.\u201d The first-time mother said she had spent months collecting clothes as she excitedly awaited her daughter\u2019s arrival. But she was forced to leave most of them behind and she and her family fled.   \u201cAll the baby clothes I prepared for her I lost,\" Razan said. \u201cNow all I care about is finding clothes and food.\u201d  Raf Sanchez is a foreign correspondent for NBC News.

        "title": "As outrage grows over fate of babies in Gaza hospital, Israel offers incubators and fuel",
        "content": "As outrage grows over reports of babies dying and a mass grave being dug at Gaza\u2019s Al-Shifa hospital, Israel has publicly indicated a desire to mitigate the crisis there \u2014 not by ending the siege but by offering fuel and mobile incubators. On Sunday night, the Israel Defense Forces released video appearing to show soldiers depositing 300 liters (about 79 gallons) of fuel at Al-Shifa\u2019s entrance and announced an evacuation route for people in the complex to flee. On Monday came a pledge that the IDF would coordinate the delivery of incubators to Al-Shifa, following reports that premature babies there had to be removed from their incubators because of power shortages. Then on Tuesday, the IDF shared a photo of a female soldier helping load mobile incubators into a van, which an IDF spokesperson said would be used to transfer at-risk infants out of the hospital.  \u201cWe are trying to bring in incubators that can help transfer babies out of Shifa Hospital to other places down south, which will help safeguard the babies in the hospital,\u201d IDF spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said.  The IDF said in a briefing later on Tuesday that the incubators had come from Israel\u2019s Tel Hashomer Hospital and are \u201cintended to be used to move premature babies to a safer space.\u201d Asked how they will be delivered to Al-Shifa, spokesman Lt. Col. Amnon Shefler said coordination with the hospital \u201chas not yet been completed.\u201d Dr. Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, said the hospital had not yet gotten a \u201cproper offer\u201d from the IDF to evacuate the babies.  Gaza\u2019s hospitals, Al-Shifa in particular, have captured the world\u2019s attention and become one of the war\u2019s biggest and most contentious storylines as they run out of fuel and resources amid an overwhelming influx of patients injured by Israeli airstrikes. Israel has repeatedly alleged that Hamas hides in tunnels below Gaza hospitals, including under Al-Shifa \u2014 which both Hamas and hospital workers have denied. But images of vulnerable babies and desperate pleas from Al-Shifa's medical staff for fuel to keep the hospital running have garnered intense public sympathy. President Joe Biden said Monday he hoped and expected that there would be \u201cless intrusive action relative to the hospital,\u201d and that the hospital \u201cmust be protected.\u201d Israeli officials appear acutely aware that the world is watching in dismay. \u201cThe IDF remains committed to upholding its moral and professional responsibilities to distinguish between civilians and Hamas terrorists,\u201d the army said in a statement announcing the transfer of incubators. However, doctors at Al-Shifa and spokesmen for the Palestinian Ministry of Health have highlighted what they see as inadequacies in Israel\u2019s offers.  A spokesman for the ministry told Reuters on Tuesday that they do not object to having babies evacuated from Al-Shifa to a hospital in Egypt, West Bank or even Israel, but that there is no way to ensure that can happen safely amid the fighting. Israel has instituted daily, four-hour humanitarian pauses in the fighting in northern Gaza and urged residents to evacuate south, though southern Gaza has also faced significant bombardment. The Red Cross, meanwhile, said it is in touch with both parties about Al-Shifa but that no concrete plans or decisions regarding a transfer of the newborns involving the organization have been made. Failing an evacuation, it is not clear how the delivery of incubators would help save the lives of premature babies when Al-Shifa lacks electricity to power them \u2014 the reason they were removed from incubators in the first place.  NBC News was also unable to verify when the incubators might be delivered or how the Israeli army would get them to Al-Shifa amid the violence in the area, which hospital staff said left them afraid of venturing outside.  The promised evacuation route from the hospital, too, does not seem to have changed the situation \u2014 doctors at Al-Shifa on Monday said they were not aware of anyone leaving the hospital in the prior two days. Dr. Nidal Abu Hadrus, a neurosurgeon at Al-Shifa, said on Monday that it was impossible for people to leave given the close sounds of bombing and shooting outside.  \u201cIt is not safe to move out. It is not safe to stay. We don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said.  Although many people were able to evacuate from Al-Shifa earlier in the conflict, fighting in the area has intensified since Friday, and the World Health Organization said 600 patients remained there on Monday. El Mokhallalati estimated the number as closer to 700, and said there are also 700 staff members there and 2,000 to 3,000 civilians taking shelter. Israel has denied that Al-Shifa is under siege.  As for the 300 liters of fuel Israel left at the hospital entrance, a doctor there said on Sunday that Al-Shifa staff had not retrieved it because the amount was virtually a drop in the bucket. At least 10,000 liters per day (2,640 gallons) would be needed to run vital parts of the hospital, according to Dr. Marwan Abusada, a surgeon at the hospital who is also the head of international cooperation at the health ministry. The IDF alleged that Hamas had told hospital staff not to collect the fuel. It said Tuesday that the delivery was just meant to \u201cgain more time\u201d to save the lives of people in the hospital \u2014 specifically babies and children \u2014 and not run the entire hospital.  Al-Shifa was forced to bury its dead in a mass grave inside the complex on Tuesday, with around 180 bodies buried there, El Mokhallalati said.  The hospital\u2019s director, Midhat Abbas, said the bodies had been starting to decompose. The hospital has \u201cturned into a real cemetery for the sick and wounded,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Nearly two dozen toddlers sickened by lead linked to applesauce pouches, CDC says",
        "content": "U.S. health officials are warning doctors to be on the lookout for possible cases of lead poisoning in children after at least 22 toddlers in 14 states were sickened by lead linked to tainted pouches of cinnamon apple puree and applesauce. Children ages 1 to 3 were affected, and at least one child showed a blood lead level eight times higher than the level that raises concern, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. There\u2019s no safe level of lead exposure, but the CDC uses a marker of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter to identify children with higher levels than most. The affected children\u2019s blood lead levels ranged from 4 to 29 micrograms per deciliter. The reported symptoms included headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a change in activity level and anemia. The illnesses are part of an outbreak tied to recalled pouches of fruit puree marketed to kids from the brands WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree and Schnucks and Weis cinnamon applesauce pouches. The products were sold in stores and online. Parents and caregivers should not buy or serve the products, and kids who may have eaten them should be tested for lead levels. Children who are affected may show no symptoms, experts said. Lead exposure can lead to serious learning and behavior problems. Heavy metals like lead can get into food products from soil, air, water or industrial processes, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The CDC said there were cases in the following states as of Nov. 7: Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

        "title": "Sudden cardiac arrest deaths declining in college athletes, new research shows",
        "content": "Deaths due to cardiac arrest in college athletes have been steadily declining over the last 20 years, a new study finds. An analysis of data from more than 2 million NCAA athletes revealed that 143 had died after a cardiac arrest that occurred while they were playing their sport and that there was wide variation in the risk of death after a sudden heart stoppage, depending on the player\u2019s race, gender and sport, according to the research presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association .  \u201cWe don\u2019t know why the rate of cardiac arrest deaths has been going down,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Kimberly Harmon, a professor in the departments of family medicine and orthopedics and sports medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cYou could hypothesize that it\u2019s because there are better emergency action plans when there is a cardiac arrest, more people who know CPR and clear access to a defibrillator,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone passes out suddenly, you should think cardiac arrest until evidence shows otherwise.\u201d The decrease could also be due to more screening, with colleges increasingly requiring athletes be cleared to play with an exam that includes an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), which measures the heart\u2019s electrical activity and can detect dangerous heart rhythms. \u201cThe patterns on an EKG can also tell a lot about the shape and size of the heart,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cIn athletes, we are primarily looking for electrical or heart muscle disease.\u201d It\u2019s been shown that screening that includes an EKG will catch between two-thirds and three-quarters of athletes at risk, she said. Athletes who have an abnormal EKG might be sent for an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the organ.  Cardiac arrest in college athletes is relatively rare: In any given year, 1 in 63,000 college athletes die from cardiac arrest, the study found. Harmon\u2019s data showed that in any given year, there were eight sudden cardiac deaths in NCAA athletes. However, when the researchers dug down into the data by gender, race and sport, they found that there were some very striking differences. Basketball players had a higher risk, at 1 in 8,188 in any given years. \u201cIf you consider athletes who played four years, then it\u2019s 1 in a little over 2,000,\u201d Harmon said.  Men were at higher risk than women: 1 in 43,348, compared to 1 in 164,504 women college athletes in any given year. Deaths among Black athletes were three times more common than those among white players: 1 in 27,217, compared to 1 in 74,581 in any given year. Sport cardiologists have previously suggested the reasons that Black athletes face greater risk of cardiac arrest could include genetics, lifestyle and which sport they play. Autopsies found no heart defects in the majority of those who died. Most likely in these cases, there was an electrical short circuit, Harmon said. \u201cWhen electrical activity in the heart is not coordinated, it quivers and does not pump blood and the person passes out,\u201d she added. The study didn\u2019t look at how many athletes had a cardiac arrest and survived, something researchers hope to explore in the future. What\u2019s striking about the study is that even though the incidence of sudden cardiac death is low overall, in certain populations, it\u2019s less rare, said Dr. Mary Ann McLaughlin, director of cardiovascular wellness at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City. McLaughlin was surprised by how high the rate of sudden cardiac death in basketball players was and speculated that it might be due to stresses on the heart as players sprinted up and down the court. Should all high school and college athletes be screened before being allowed on sports teams? It's complicated, experts said, because some athletes and their families might not have the ability to pay for physicals, especially those that include an EKG. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it should be a barrier to participation because being on a team has so many physical and emotional benefits,\u201d Harmon said. The new study underscores the importance of schools having an easily accessible defibrillator \u2014  which can jolt the heart back to beating  \u2014 and a team trained to deal with cardiac arrests, said Dr. English Flack, an associate professor of pediatric cardiology at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children\u2019s Hospital at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. It was also \u201cpretty reassuring to see that the incidence of sudden cardiac death has decreased,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next reasonable question is, why and how. Either the rate of cardiac arrest stayed the same and the number of athletes who were rescued increased or the rate of cardiac arrest is decreasing due to increased screening.\u201d The focus should be on making sure every school has an automatic electronic defibrillator and a team that can help resuscitate an athlete who experiences a cardiac arrest, Flack said \u201cMany schools can\u2019t afford an AED,\u201d she said. McLaughlin would also like to see screening rates increase: \u201cThe risks associated with doing a physical exam and EKG are very low compared to the potential benefit of saving a life in someone who has a risk for sudden death.\u201d Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News.

        "title": "State attorney general, doctors and nurses criticize HCA over patient care at North Carolina's Mission Hospital",
        "content": "Four years after it bought Mission Hospital, an 815-bed facility in Asheville, North Carolina, HCA Healthcare is under fire in the region, threatened with a lawsuit by the state attorney general and facing criticism from nurses and at least 124 current and former Mission doctors who say HCA, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit hospital chain, is imperiling patient care at the facility in its pursuit of profits.  \u201cProfits over people is not an ethic, model, or aspiration that can deliver the quality of care we all expect and deserve,\u201d the doctors wrote in a letter to the independent monitor watching over management of the hospital. \u201cWe ask that hospital leadership look at economics as if people mattered.\u201d  On Oct. 31, the office of North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein wrote a letter to a foundation called Dogwood Health Trust, contending that HCA had violated the terms of the agreement it struck in 2019 when it bought Mission, a formerly nonprofit facility. Under that agreement, HCA had promised to continue providing an array of specific services for a decade at the hospital, including those involving behavioral health, emergency and trauma, oncology and pediatrics. Dogwood Health Trust was created when HCA bought Mission and works to improve the health of people in Western North Carolina.  The attorney general\u2019s office noted a breach of that agreement at Mission, citing diminished care in the hospital\u2019s oncology unit and its emergency department. The letter warned that if HCA does not cure the violations within 40 days, Stein \u201cis authorized to file suit.\u201d  A Mission spokeswoman said in a statement that the hospital is proud of the health care it provides and is disappointed by the attorney general\u2019s statements. \u201cWe continue to meet, and often exceed, the obligations under the asset purchase agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cThe independent monitor has confirmed compliance every year since the agreement was signed in 2019.\u201d The spokeswoman also provided a letter signed by 75 Mission practitioners who say patients continue to receive great care at the facility. Dr. Martin Palmeri, an oncologist who practiced at Mission before HCA took over and has continued to practice there, has a different view. Before the HCA buyout, he said in an interview with NBC News, local oncologists had developed excellent clinical programs to treat patients in the region. But after HCA acquired Mission, he said, nursing staff declined precipitously, the number of chemotherapy-trained pharmacists went from four to one, and the HCA labs services and turnaround times declined significantly. These deficiencies made it difficult to treat the full array of cancer patients coming to the hospital, he said.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to resolve these problems, Palmeri said the only choice he and his colleagues had was to stop offering three oncology services at which he said Mission had previously excelled. They were treatments for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and primary central nervous system lymphoma. \u201cWe felt it would be best for our patients to get their complex hematology care somewhere else,\u201d he said.  HCA declined to address Palmeri's criticisms. But a spokesman provided letters the company has sent to North Carolina officials disputing criticisms of its oncology services. The letters call them \u201cunfounded\u201d and say HCA\u2019s takeover of Mission has resulted in \u201cenhanced oncology services\u201d there. Moreover, nurse-to-patient ratios in oncology are \u201cflexible and adaptable to patient needs\u201d and consistent with best practices at HCA\u2019s cancer institute, the letters say.  Regarding understaffing of chemo-trained pharmacists, HCA told state officials in the letters that it is \u201ccontinuing to pursue opportunities to further enhance its pharmacy coverage and offerings.\u201d As for the lab problems, HCA said, \u201cMission is enhancing lab technician training to permit technician staffing that better targets volume needs on a day-to-day basis, which will further reduce processing times.\u201d   Mission\u2019s emergency department is another problem, according to doctors, nurses and patients. Bryan Robinson, a psychotherapist and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, said he has experienced the deficiencies first-hand. In 2019, before HCA took over the hospital, Robinson told NBC News he visited Mission\u2019s emergency department with chest pains. He did not have to wait, quickly received a stent and departed.  In late September, when he returned to Mission\u2019s emergency department with a low heart rate, he had a vastly different experience. After waiting for six hours, Robinson, 78, said he was called to a partitioned area where his diagnosis was discussed. It was neither private nor soundproof, he said, adding that he could hear about other patients\u2019 conditions as he felt sure they heard about his. He feels the hospital violated his privacy rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. He complained to Mission but did not get a response, he said.   \u201cThe worst part of all this is the doctors and nurses are phenomenal \u2014 this is not about them,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about this facility that has been turned into Kentucky Fried Hospital.\u201d  Mission\u2019s spokeswoman declined to comment on Robinson\u2019s points. The hospital\u2019s chief executive, Chad Patrick, declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview.  HCA Healthcare operates almost 180 hospitals in the U.S. and generates billions in earnings. NBC News has reported extensively on HCA this year, examining company practices that more than 60 doctors and nurses say put profits ahead of patients. Among those reports was one in January on understaffing at HCA facilities, centering on Mission Hospital. Developments in the HCA Mission dispute have been covered closely by Asheville Watchdog, a free, local and not-for-profit news organization. On Nov. 1, EMS in nearby McDowell County, North Carolina, stopped transferring nonemergency patients to Mission Hospital, citing hourslong wait times for paramedics who must continue caring for their patients until they are admitted.  \u201cOur agency has worked with HCA for more than a year now to address and improve the extended wait times at Mission Hospital,\u201d Will Kehler, emergency services director for McDowell County, said in a press release. \u201cUnfortunately, we are making no progress and the situation is getting worse. Paramedics waiting 1-2 hours in the ER for a bed and a nurse to assume care is a situation that should never be deemed acceptable.\u201d  The Mission spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on the McDowell County EMS\u2019s action. The 124 doctors who signed the letter criticizing HCA\u2019s management of Mission included nine former chiefs of staff at the hospital, six former Mission board members, and 66 actively practicing physicians, including 17 who signed themselves as \u201canonymous,\u201d according to a former Mission doctor.  Several current and former Mission doctors who spoke with NBC News did so on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation by HCA. Noting that more than 200 doctors have left the hospital since HCA took over, the letter said: \u201cStifling the ability to speak freely undercuts the communication necessary for shared trust, continued improvement, and a greater good.\" The letter supporting Mission management signed by 75 practitioners at the hospital said care continues to be excellent. \u201cThere was turnover within both the hospital and physician leadership which meant new relationships had to be formed,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis, no doubt, was emotionally difficult and has taken time for us to heal.\u201d Two longtime Mission nurses spoke with NBC News for this article \u2014 Kelly Coward, a cardiac ICU nurse and Mark Klein, a vascular access nurse. After HCA acquired Mission, its nursing staff voted to unionize. Both Coward and Klein worked at Mission before the HCA takeover and still work there, and they discussed the differences. Most center on understaffing that threatens patients at the facility, they said. For example, each ICU nurse now often cares for three patients, they say, not one or two, as is safe; and charge nurses now have patients they must care for, which was not the case previously. Unit secretaries are gone, both nurses said, so there\u2019s no one to answer phones, and the number of nursing assistants has dwindled. As a result, nurses must pick up those duties, Coward and Klein said. In the emergency department, Klein said, \u201cthe triage area was never a treatment area before; now it is. The diminishment is across the board \u2014 HCA may be continuing services, but they\u2019re not continuing them at the same level.\u201d Coward described two important services for cardiac patients that vanished under HCA. One, called Heart Path, was an educational program that helped new heart patients understand their diagnoses. \u201cThe team of nurses told them what to expect,\u201d she said, \u201cmade sure they had their follow-up appointments and all the tools they needed to be successful with their new diagnosis.\u201d Under another program that disappeared under HCA, a nurse would follow patients recently diagnosed with heart disease through hospital discharge and subsequent appointments with physicians. \u201cThese people are going to slip through the cracks,\u201d Coward said. The Mission spokeswoman declined to comment on the nurses\u2019 criticisms. Scrutiny on HCA\u2019s stewardship of Mission coincides with a growing call from some physician groups to ban corporations practicing medicine, which they say imperils both patients and doctors. Over 30 states in the nation have laws barring corporations from practicing medicine to prevent health care from being tainted by commercial influences and the drive for profits. California, for example, prohibits corporations or other nonlicensed people or entities from practicing medicine, assisting in the unlicensed practice of medicine, employing physicians or owning physician practices. But few states enforce these laws and the corporate ownership of physician practices and other health care entities has grown significantly in recent years. \u201cProfit-oriented corporations are exerting control over physicians and the practice of medicine throughout the country,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Li, a practicing emergency physician and founder of Take Medicine Back, a public benefit company pushing for a bar on corporations practicing medicine. \u201cBut there are few places where this is more pronounced than in Western North Carolina where HCA took over Mission. The company has joined forces with Wall Street private-equity firms that employ physicians to extract wealth from the community and those physicians can be \u2018removed from the schedule\u2019 on a whim without justification. If they cross HCA administration, they have few alternative opportunities for work.\u201d The Mission spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Li\u2019s statement.  In Florida, where HCA operates 46 hospitals, two state lawmakers have drafted a bill to be submitted in the January legislative session that would bar entities other than physician groups, not-for-profit hospitals and medical schools from employing, controlling or interfering with a physician\u2019s clinical judgment.   Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat in the Florida House representing a part of Palm Beach County, is one of the bill\u2019s proponents. \u201cSeventy-four percent of Florida physicians are under corporate ownership,\u201d Skidmore told NBC News. \u201cThe practice of medicine has been stolen from physicians and I want to give it back to them.\u201d   She acknowledges a long fight ahead.

        "title": "In two studies, experimental drugs for cholesterol show \u2018revolutionary\u2019 promise",
        "content": "New, experimental drugs designed to drive down dangerous levels of cholesterol were shown to be safe and effective in two groundbreaking bodies of research presented Sunday at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. Both medications target people born with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol. While drugs like statins, as well as diet and exercise, can help these individuals manage cholesterol, they cannot change the underlying genetic cause. The two new approaches work in different ways, but with a singular mission: go after genes responsible for raising cholesterol to change the trajectory of a person\u2019s risk for heart attack and stroke. Neither treatment had ever been tested in humans before. And both will need years of additional research before they'd be considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Still, experts are impressed with the results. \"There is no way to categorize this other than revolutionary,\" said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director for critical care services at South Shore University Hospital, Northwell Cardiovascular Institute in New York. Cassiere was not involved with either study. One of the treatments, from Boston-based Verve Therapeutics, uses a gene-editing approach called base editing. It involves an IV infusion of a drug that targets the PCSK9 gene, which is instrumental in the production of LDL, often called \"bad\" cholesterol. When the drug zeroes in on PCSK9, it makes a tiny change to the gene. The effect is akin to a permanent eraser, removing its ability to raise cholesterol, said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, Verve's co-founder and chief executive officer. In theory, the one-time treatment should last a lifetime. Patients so far have only been followed for six months. Verve's preliminary study, which was presented on Sunday, was meant to test the safety of the drug. Ten patients participated. Most received doses that didn't make a measurable difference in their LDL levels, but were found to be safe. Three patients, however, were given higher doses \u2014 and their LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by more than half. Additional studies will be needed to ensure the treatment remains safe, without unexpected side effects, and effective. Verve's research was limited to people with a genetic condition called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in which cholesterol levels are sky-high from birth. Many people affected suffer heart attacks at young ages, in their 30s or 40s. Kathiresan, a cardiologist who previously worked at Massachusetts General Hospital and was a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has long focused his research on understanding why some people have heart attacks at young ages, and why others do not. He has a strong family history of high cholesterol. In 2012, his brother died from a heart attack at age 40. That's when Kathiresan decided \"to try to develop a therapy that could avert tragedies like what's happened in my family.\" It is unclear whether the approach will make a measurable impact on heart attack and stroke risk \u2014 that remains to be seen in future studies. Experts were still optimistic about the technology. \"While larger and longer-term studies are required to assess both effectiveness, durability and safety, this should be the dawn of an era of therapeutic gene targeting for cardiovascular disease,\" said Dr. Sahil Parikh, director of endovascular services at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. Parikh was not involved with Verve's research. Findings on a second novel therapy were also presented on Sunday. The results, though early, offer a promising glimpse of what could be the first treatment for a particularly dangerous type of cholesterol called lipoprotein(a). People with high levels of Lp(a) are at extremely high risk of having fats and cholesterol build up in their arteries. That's because Lp(a) gloms onto LDL cholesterol, making those LDL particles even stickier and more likely to cause plaque. It's like adding super glue to duct tape. And it's purely genetic, meaning that people are born with this elevated risk. Diet and exercise have no impact on Lp(a) levels. \"It is essentially untreatable,\" said study author Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. \"The only way to target such a genetic risk factor is to find a way to interfere with the product of the gene.\" Nissen and colleagues used a novel approach to correcting how that gene acts. They used a drug called lepodisiran, which targets mRNA. If that sounds familiar, it should: Most Covid vaccines use mRNA to prompt the body to make an antibody against SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the mRNA in question tells the body to produce Lp(a). The drug stops this from happening, essentially shooting the messenger. Nissen's study was meant to test the safety of lepodisiran. It was small, including just 48 adults in the U.S. and Singapore. All had very high levels of Lp(a). Overall, the drug was found to be safe, with no major side effects, Nissen said. But it also dramatically lowered their Lp(a) levels. A single shot of lepodisiran drove down Lp(a) by more than 94% for nearly one year, the study found. The results of the study, which was sponsored by drugmaker Eli Lilly, were published Sunday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \"This really offers a lot of hope for patients with elevated lipoprotein(a),\" Nissen said. \"We're working as fast as we can because there are patients dying every day because of this disorder. We've not been able to treat it, and we need to change that.\" As many as 64 million Americans have elevated Lp(a) levels, most commonly people of African and South Asian descent. Additional research is critical. An important question moving forward is whether lowering Lp(a) actually cuts heart risks. \"We've had to wait until this generation of therapeutics where we can directly and specifically target Lp(a) and do it safely to see whether that will also result in fewer heart attacks and strokes,\" said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, professor and chair of the department of preventive medicine Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Lloyd-Jones, also a past president of the American Heart Association, was not involved with the lepodisiran study. Nissen predicts that the treatment could someday be used as an \"annual vaccine-like treatment for this previously untreatable disorder.\" While many heart problems may be avoided with lifestyle changes such as exercise and healthy diets, Lloyd-Jones said, the medical community needs therapies to help people whose genes put them at greater risk for heart attacks and stroke. \"We'll always need some medication for people who are at very high risk,\" he said.

        "title": "Wegovy and other weight loss drugs shows promise for heart disease",
        "content": "The weight-loss drug Wegovy can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20% in adults with heart disease and obesity, according to new research. The trial is the first to show that a weight-loss medication can help protect against serious heart problems in obese adults, potentially opening the door to a new treatment option for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. The findings could also have important implications for insurance coverage of the drugs. Currently, insurance companies are reluctant to provide coverage for weight-loss drugs, and Medicare, by law, is barred from covering them. \u201cI think this will force insurance and Medicare to consider reimbursement,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and executive vice president of Scripps Research in California. The results were presented on Saturday at the 2023 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cThis is a pretty big deal,\u201d said Dr. Michael Lincoff, the study\u2019s lead author and a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who presented the findings. \u201cJust being overweight or having obesity is a risk factor for increased risk of heart disease, and yet we\u2019ve had no treatment that addressed that specific risk factor.\u201d The trial included more than 17,600 adults ages 45 and up with heart disease who got either a weekly 2.4-milligram dose of semaglutide, which is the drug used in Wegovy, or a placebo. About three-quarters of the participants were men. All of the study participants were either overweight or obese but did not have diabetes. Patients who had a heart attack or stroke within the last 60 days were not allowed to enroll in the trial. After about three years of follow-up, there were cardiovascular events \u2014 such as heart attack, stroke or death linked to heart disease \u2014 in 569 participants in the Wegovy group, compared to 701 participants in the placebo group. That corresponds to a 20% lower risk in people who took Wegovy. \u201cThat is significant,\u201d said Dr. Amit Khera, director of the preventive cardiology program at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas. Khera co-authored an editorial that was published Saturday alongside the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. A new treatment option like Wegovy would be a big deal for people with heart disease, Khera said. One of the risk factors is being overweight or obese, which affects about 70% of the U.S. population. \u201cWe finally have some treatments that are not only very effective for weight loss, but also seem to be very beneficial for heart disease,\u201d he said. The findings are even more significant because older weight-loss medications, like phentermine or orlistat, have not been shown to protect against serious heart problems, said Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and the senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina. One weight-loss drug, fen-phen, was taken off the U.S. market in the late 1990s because it was linked to serious heart problems. \u201cThis is amazing evidence that semaglutide not only helps people with diabetes prevent devastating complications but also helps patients with obesity lose weight and avoid major adverse heart consequences,\u201d said Spratt. (Semaglutide is also approved as a diabetes drug under the name Ozempic.) Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, said that researchers still don\u2019t know exactly how the medication prevents serious heart problems in overweight patients. It could be the result of the weight loss itself or some other mechanism in the drug, Shah said. \u201cThat question is under investigation right now,\u201d he said. Lincoff, the study author, said that inflammation could potentially play a role. Inflammation can cause plaques in the arteries to rupture and form blood clots, leading to heart attacks and strokes. In the trial, Lincoff said, patients taking the drug saw reductions in inflammation that were similar to the reductions seen in patients on statins. That is \u201cpretty sizable,\u201d he said. Additional research also presented Saturday at the American Heart Association conference supports that idea. Researchers at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City looked at how much another weight loss drug, tirzepatide, reduced inflammation in patients with Type 2 diabetes and who have heart disease. Tirzepatide, which is similar to semaglutide, is the ingredient found in Eli Lilly\u2019s diabetes drug Mounjaro and the newly approved weight loss drug Zepbound. In the study, the researchers measured levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, a protein the liver produces in response to inflammation.  The research included nearly 2,000 people, half of whom were taking tirzepatide and half of whom were taking insulin. Researchers looked at CRP levels in the participants\u2019 blood taken at three points in the study \u2014 the beginning, at 24 weeks and at 52 weeks. By the end of the study, CRP levels were 40% to 50% lower in the tirzepatide group.  \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous reduction in inflammation,\u201d said study author Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai who presented the findings. Bhatt, who received funding for the study from Lilly, said a randomized clinical trial is still needed to confirm the heart benefits. \u201cOne would hope that would translate into reductions in cardiovascular risk,\u201d he added. Topol, of Scripps Research, said newer weight loss drugs have the potential to become new treatments for heart disease. Although the Wegovy results are promising, Topol said that additional research is still needed on how well the drug lowers cardiovascular risk in patients with obesity who do not have heart disease. The Wegovy trial \u201cwas a very select group of patients because they all had heart disease,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a lot more work to find out if people who aren\u2019t so high-risk would benefit.\u201d Lincoff said additional analyses will be run over the next year, including looking at subgroups of patients, to understand exactly how the drug prevents heart problems and who could benefit. \u201cHow much was through weight loss? How much was through the inflammation? How much was through the sugar control?\u201d he said. Obesity is a public health issue, Khera said, and more work is needed to address issues around equity. \u201cWe also have to appreciate that these drugs are really expensive, and a lot of people will not be able to access them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as much as we\u2019re looking at the drug, we still need to look upstream as to why we have obesity and downstream about people who can\u2019t afford them.\u201d Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "More than 500 people asked to test for tuberculosis after case at Nebraska day care",
        "content": "A Nebraska health department is investigating more than 500 possible exposures to tuberculosis linked to an active case at a YMCA in Omaha. The infected person was part of the YMCA\u2019s drop-in child care program, so those at risk of exposure are primarily young kids. The Douglas County Health Department said anyone who had close contact with the infected person from May 30 through Oct. 30 should get tested for tuberculosis bacteria, which can spread through the air when someone with an active case coughs, sneezes or speaks. Many people who become infected with the bacteria never develop symptomatic tuberculosis. Up to 13 million people in the U.S. have latent tuberculosis infections, meaning the bacteria is inactive and the infected person doesn\u2019t have symptoms and isn\u2019t contagious. Around 5% to 10% of infections, if left untreated, progress to active disease. In adults, symptoms typically include a bad cough that lasts three weeks or longer, chest pain, or coughing up blood or phlegm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children may have symptoms such as a cough, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, fever or night sweats. Dr. Kari Neemann, medical adviser for the Douglas County Health Department, said the active case was diagnosed over the weekend. The health department learned about the case Monday, then discovered the link to the YMCA on Tuesday, said Justin Frederick, the department\u2019s deputy director. The YCMA of Greater Omaha said it used attendance records to determine which children or staff may have been exposed, then contacted those individuals Thursday. People who were in the same room as the patient are considered close contacts, but those who had brief exposures in areas such as cafeterias, hallways, restrooms or gymnasiums are not. \u201cIf folks attend the YMCA but they don\u2019t have children in the Child Watch program, I would say their risk is zero,\u201d Frederick said. Neemann said she\u2019s optimistic that there isn\u2019t a risk to the larger community. \u201cKids really have a very low risk of transmitting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re doing this huge investigation, we don\u2019t expect it to go beyond this too much.\u201d Douglas County\u2019s tuberculosis investigation may be one of the largest ever in the Midwest, Frederick said, but Nebraska historically doesn\u2019t see many cases. Nationally, there were 8,300 tuberculosis cases in 2022 \u2014 an increase compared to the previous two years, but still lower than pre-pandemic levels. Just 28 of those cases were in Nebraska. Frederick said Douglas County identified 15 cases last year, and another 15 as of September of this year. The infected patient at the day care developed a cough in August, he said, so health officials assume the person was infectious around that time. The department\u2019s testing recommendation is based on people who were exposed to the patient three months before or after that cough started. The patient has a case of pulmonary tuberculosis, Frederick added, meaning the bacteria is concentrated in the lungs. In more complicated cases, tuberculosis bacteria can infect other organs like the brain, kidneys or spine. Frederick said the patient is being isolated and given treatment under the department\u2019s supervision. Treatment for tuberculosis \u2014 antibiotics taken daily or weekly \u2014 typically lasts at least six months, though some courses can take a year or longer. Infants and young children have a higher risk of developing active disease compared to older children and adults. Little kids are also more likely to develop severe tuberculosis that spreads from the lungs to other parts of the body, or results in meningitis. For that reason, the Douglas County Health Department is recommending that kids under age 5 who were exposed to the infected patient within the last 10 weeks get a chest X-ray to make sure their lungs are clear of infection, plus a tuberculosis test and a course of rifampin \u2014 an antibiotic that can prevent them from developing active disease. Children\u2019s Nebraska is holding a clinic this weekend to administer tests, X-rays and treatment. Neemann, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, said kids under age 2 will receive a skin test, while kids ages 2 and up will get a blood test. Frederick estimated that around 200 kids have been asked to come to the clinic, and 150 are registered to attend so far. When more than 10 weeks have passed since a child\u2019s last exposure, they should get tested again to confirm that they aren\u2019t infected, Neemann said. That\u2019s because it takes around two to 10 weeks for an infection to develop. If a child tests positive, but has no symptoms, they can finish the full course of rifampin, which usually lasts several months. The YMCA said other close contacts who were exposed from late May until Aug. 21 can get tested at clinics held from Nov. 15-17 at the organization\u2019s Westview facility.

        "title": "Virginia RB Perris Jones regained movement in his arms and legs after being carted off field",
        "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Virginia running back Perris Jones regained movement in all of his extremities, school officials said, hours after being immobilized on a flat board and carted off the field after being injured on a play late in the third quarter against No. 11 Louisville on Thursday night. Football spokesman Jim Daves said in a text early Friday that Jones will remain at UofL Hospital overnight. Jones caught a 7-yard pass from Anthony Colandrea and was starting to run upfield when he fumbled after a hard hit on his helmet by Cam\u2019Ron Kelly with several other Cardinals nearby. Malik Washington scooped up the ball near the right sideline and dashed down the field for the go-ahead touchdown to make 21-14. Kelly said the play opened up for him to make the tackle and indicated that Jones tried to go low and he went low, too. \u201cI\u2019m just praying for him,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI said my piece to him when he was on the stretcher. I\u2019ve got nothing but love for him. I hope he has a speedy recovery.\u201d Spectators in L&N Stadium fell silent as medical personnel from Virginia and Louisville quickly rushed to tend to Jones as he lay on the turf, and a cart quickly entered the field. Players from both teams knelt for about 15 minutes as Jones was treated and gently lifted onto the board with his head wrapped between two pads, and then onto the cart as Cavaliers players gathered around. Fans and players applauded Jones as the cart left the field. He was taken to UofL Hospital for observation and coach Tony Elliott said after the game that Jones was going to have an MRI. \u201cWe are getting some encouraging news, but I don\u2019t want say anything until we get it officially,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult reality of the sport that we play, that every play can end that way, and you don\u2019t wish that for anybody. Man, I know one thing: (Perris Jones) is a tough young man and he lays it on the line every time he goes out there for this football team. (We\u2019re) believing and praying that he\u2019s going to have a full recovery. I\u2019m putting that in the Lord\u2019s hands and I\u2019m asking for that in advance and believing that that\u2019s going to be the case.\u201d Louisville rallied to beat Virginia 31-24. ",

        "title": "Breast implants used in man's lifesaving double-lung transplant",
        "content": "Davey Bauer's lung infection was too life-threatening for a standard transplant. If doctors replaced his lungs with healthy ones right away, Bauer wouldn't survive the surgery. In April, shortly after catching the flu, Bauer had developed a lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics. The 34-year-old Missouri resident had a history of smoking cigarettes and also vaped for the last nine years. Doctors in St. Louis put Bauer on a ventilator in a medically induced coma to support his breathing. But his condition continued to deteriorate. Bauer was transferred to Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, where surgeons removed his lungs and used a life-support device called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, to keep him alive while he cleared the infection from his bloodstream. There was still one problem, though: Without lungs to physically support it, his heart would move around or fall deeper into his chest cavity. \"Once we took the lungs out, we realized that now we've got to support the heart,\" Bauer's surgeon, Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery at Northwestern Medicine, said Wednesday on a press call. \"We were looking for the biggest thing that would fit in there in his chest cavity.\" The solution, they determined, was a pair of DD breast implants. According to Northwestern Medicine, the procedure is the first time breast implants have been used in a double-lung transplant. \u201cI didn\u2019t know much of it until after the fact, but I thought that was awesome and kind of funny,\u201d Bauer said of the role the implants played in his procedure. With the implants keeping his heart in place, Bauer was able to clear the infection. Two days after his lungs were removed, doctors took out the implants and successfully transplanted healthy donor lungs into his body. Bauer was discharged from the hospital in September and is now being monitored by his transplant team. He is expected to make a full recovery. \"I feel so blessed. It's incredible,\" he said on Wednesday. \"I got a second chance at life.\" Often when a critically ill patient is deemed too weak for a lung transplant, doctors may have no recourse. But the Northwestern surgeons constructed what amounted to an artificial lung that kept supplying oxygen to Bauer's blood even after his lungs were removed. The team placed multiple tubes in Bauer's heart that rerouted his blood out of his body to the ECMO machine. From there, the machine added oxygen to the blood \u2014 a job usually done by the lungs \u2014 then sent the oxygenated blood back into the body, to the left side of his heart, which pumped it out to the rest of his body. \"We wanted to maintain the natural blood flow in his body that would be present if the lungs were intact,\" Bharat said. Bauer\u2019s partner, Susan Gore, said she can't comprehend how he lived through the procedure. \u201cIt still blows my mind that he didn\u2019t have lungs in his body but he was still alive,\u201d she said. Bharat said he hopes the technique can be used to save other patients who are too sick to get transplants right away. Keeping a patient alive without lungs is incredibly rare and requires a great deal of expertise, but it's not entirely novel, said Dr. John Michael Reynolds, a transplant pulmonologist at Duke Health who wasn't involved in Bauer's case. \u201cThey put these implants in, that\u2019s the eye-grabbing thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a very minor aspect of what was done.\u201d In 2019, Reynolds' team at Duke similarly kept a patient alive without any lungs using artificial oxygen support. The patient, a 30-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, underwent a double-lung transplant six days later and ultimately recovered. Two years earlier, surgeons at the University of Toronto performed a similar procedure on another patient with cystic fibrosis. Dr. Brian Keller, medical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Lung Transplantation Program, said doctors are generally improving their ability to transplant very sick patients, but many transplant centers don't have the skill for a procedure like Bauer's. \u201cThere are very few centers in the world that would even attempt to do this,\" he said. Doctors can't pinpoint exactly why Bauer developed a life-threatening infection at such a young age. Before the episode, Bauer had never been seriously ill. He enjoyed snowboarding, skateboarding and golf. \u201cMany things lined up to get him to that point, because otherwise someone who\u2019s healthy and active and young like Davey should not have almost died from a flu infection,\u201d Bharat said. One complicating factor, Bharat said, is that Bauer had never received a flu shot. While the effectiveness of flu shots can vary from year to year, the vaccines generally reduce the risk of severe illness by 40% to 60% when they're well matched to circulating flu strains, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bharat said Bauer\u2019s history of smoking and vaping may also have played a role, though it\u2019s hard to say for sure. Smoking increases the risk of severe respiratory infections and lung disease. Similar, albeit weaker associations, have been identified for e-cigarettes. \u201cAnytime you inhale something into your lungs, whether it be through vaping, smoking or through occupational exposures, there is a risk for lung damage,\u201d Keller said. But most cases of vaping-related illness don\u2019t require a lung transplant, he added. A 17-year-old boy in Michigan who received a transplant in 2019 is believed to be the first case. Regardless of the cause of his illness, Bauer said he's not keen on vaping anymore. \"I thought it would be a safer alternative\" to cigarettes, he said. \"In hindsight it just seems like I should have quit sooner.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "These women in their 30s were told 'it's nothing,' but suspected more: It was breast cancer",
        "content": "Colombian American journalist Laura Hern\u00e1ndez was 39 in January 2022 when she felt a small lump under her left armpit.  Worried, she quickly went to her gynecologist. \u201cShe was much more relaxed than me. She told me, 'It\u2019s nothing, but just in case, we\u2019re going to send you a mammogram,'\" Hern\u00e1ndez said. The mammogram didn't yield a definitive result because of the density of her breast tissue, but she was marked as suspicious. A subsequent biopsy confirmed Hern\u00e1ndez' bad feeling \u2014 she had breast cancer.  \"This is happening to all of us, it is happening to us when we're very young, and it's happening to Latinas,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez, who lives in New York City with her husband and son. She underwent a lumpectomy and said her cancer was now in remission. Though Hern\u00e1ndez had a good outcome, each year about 42,000 women in the U.S. die from breast cancer. Though breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. women after lung cancer, it's the leading cause of death for Black and Latina women. Though October was a month to raise awareness about the disease, there are still misconceptions about breast cancer: for example, that it only affects women \u2014 about 500 men die each year of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 or that it only affects women over the age of 40. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the median age when woman are diagnosed with breast cancer is 62, and for Latinas it's slightly lower, at 57. \"A very small number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45,\" according to the ACS. But in 2022, 4% of invasive breast cancer cases and new ductal carcinoma in situ cases (an early form of breast cancer) were detected in women under 40, according to the ACS. Hern\u00e1ndez was among those 12,080 women. The ACS states that women should have the option of getting mammograms starting at age 40, and should get one once a year starting at 45. Dr. Estelamari Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for the ACS, recommends starting \u201cmuch earlier\u201d in case of a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. She also encourages women to examine their breasts regularly and to see a doctor if they detect anything abnormal. If necessary, she said, \u201cseek a second opinion, because women know their bodies and if they see a change, it must be recognized and addressed,\u201d adds Rodr\u00edguez. Julieta Cruz, who is Mexican American and lives in Sarasota, Florida, was 33 and finishing breastfeeding her baby when she detected \u201ca little ball\u201d in her breast.  According to Cruz, her doctor told her it was a hormonal lump or accumulated milk and insisted she shouldn't worry about it. But Cruz told Noticias Telemundo that her intuition and her experience as an assistant in a doctor\u2019s office made her think something was wrong.  After insisting for three months, Cruz said, she managed to have a mammogram, but a specialist ruled that it was fibrosis or a cyst and that she would have to wait six months for another test. Additionally, a genetic test came back negative for cancer risk. \"'You\u2019re very stressed, very anxious,'\u201d Cruz said her co-workers told her. Cruz then let three weeks pass and pretended that she was in a lot of pain and went to another clinic to be examined. The ultrasound test \u201clooked a little serious,\" she said, and the biopsy confirmed that she had stage 1 cancer (the first of five, with a 98% survival rate, according to the CDC). The most common medical treatment options in these cases are to operate to remove the cancer (lumpectomy) or to remove part or all of the breast (mastectomy). The decision may involve medical or personal reasons for the patient, and the treatment is sometimes accompanied by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal treatments. Cruz opted for a double mastectomy against the advice of her doctors, who recommended a lumpectomy. Cruz said she wanted to \u201celiminate the problem at its roots.\u201d On her path to healing, she lost her breasts, as well as her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes because of the other treatments. \u201cSuddenly losing that and looking in the mirror and not recognizing yourself, it's hard, right?\u201d Cruz said. \"You have to start from within.\" Two years later, at 36, Cruz' tumor is in remission. She has blood tests every six months and will have to take a pill daily for 10 years. But Cruz has fulfilled her dream of becoming a makeup and hair artist. \u201cLove yourself and say \u2018Wow, I\u2019m a warrior!\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m worth much more than my breasts, more than my hair, more than my physique.\u201d  An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.

        "title": "CDC reports highest childhood vaccine exemption rate ever in the U.S.",
        "content": "The number of kids whose caregivers are opting them out of routine childhood vaccines has reached an all-time high, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of children unprotected against preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. The report did not dive into the reasons for the increase, but experts said the findings clearly reflect Americans' growing unease about medicine in general. \"There is a rising distrust in the health care system,\" said Dr. Amna Husain, a pediatrician in private practice in North Carolina, as well as a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Vaccine exemptions \"have unfortunately trended upward with it.\" The CDC report found that 3% of children entering kindergarten during the 2022-2023 school year were granted a vaccine exemption from their state. This is the highest exemption rate ever reported in the U.S. Forty states saw rises in exemptions. In 10 states \u2014 Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin \u2014 the exemption rate soared over 5%. \"This is quite a jump,\" said Ranee Seither, a CDC epidemiologist and author of the new report. Just three years ago, Seither said, only two states had an exemption rate of more than 5%. Idaho was a standout in the new report. More than 12% of children entering kindergarten in that state had a vaccine exemption in 2022. The trend appears to coincide with doubts about Covid vaccines. \"So many people were reluctant to get that new vaccine,\" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus Public Health. She feared that it would \"have a trickle-down effect and impact vaccination coverage for our children.\" The report also found that vaccination rates among young kids have remained stagnant following a pandemic-related dip in coverage. As of the 2022-2023 school year, vaccination coverage among kindergartners remained at 93%. Before the pandemic, the rate had consistently hovered around 95%. Generally, populations need 95% immunity to protect against viral outbreaks. \"The fact that we haven't been able to recover is concerning,\" said Shannon Stokley, deputy director for science implementation in CDC's Immunization Services Division. \"It means there are children who may be unprotected from very serious diseases.\" While states differ in their vaccination requirements for attending public and most private schools, they generally include vaccines to protect against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), poliovirus and chickenpox. Some states require medical evidence that a child cannot receive a vaccine. In others, parents cite religious or other personal concerns about vaccines. \"It's very easy to get an exemption in the state of Ohio,\" Roberts said. \"Very easy.\" It was Roberts who dealt with a measles outbreak in central Ohio this time last year. The first cases were associated with a person who had traveled overseas to an area with an ongoing measles outbreak. But the virus quickly spread among children left unprotected. Kids who had not been vaccinated against measles, Roberts said, were infected just by being in the same doctor's office as kids sickened with measles. Overall, 85 people became ill, all under the age of 16. No deaths were reported, but 36 of those patients had to be hospitalized, mostly for dehydration from intense diarrhea. All of this occurred during a time when hospitals were already dealing with surges in Covid, RSV and flu. \"We really have to have our guard up,\" said Dr. Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former head of the Chicago Department of Public Health. \"We've forgotten how bad these diseases actually are.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "New toothpaste may reduce severe allergic reactions to peanuts in adults, study hints",
        "content": "Scientists have developed a new toothpaste that shows potential to prevent severe allergic reactions in adults with peanut allergies. An early-stage clinical trial tested whether 32 adults with peanut allergies could safely brush their teeth with the toothpaste, which contains trace amounts of peanut protein. The hope is that introducing small amounts of peanuts to the body over time will help the immune system get used to the allergen and reduce severe reactions. Adults in the trial used the toothpaste once daily for about 11 months. At the end of the study, none of the participants experienced severe reactions or anaphylaxis \u2014 an allergic response often characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling in the throat, pale skin, blue lips, fainting or dizziness. A summary of the results was presented Thursday at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology\u2019s annual meeting in Anaheim, California. Although the trial focused on the safety of the toothpaste and did not test the effectiveness of the treatment in adults, the findings are an early indication that it could help prevent life-threatening allergic reactions in people with severe peanut allergies. Dr. William Berger, the study\u2019s lead author and a board-certified allergist, said the toothpaste should be easier to administer than injection treatments, which are used for allergies to grass, trees and weeds. With the toothpaste, he said, \u201cpatients do not have to do anything other than brush their teeth. We think it will provide better protection because the patient will be taking their treatment on a regular basis without any interruptions.\u201d The study participants were divided into two groups: 24 adults who used the toothpaste, and eight adults who used a placebo paste. Over about four months, the researchers gradually increased the dose of peanut protein in the toothpaste until participants were receiving the equivalent of about one-third of a peanut kernel, Berger said. The researchers instructed all participants to brush their teeth with the paste for two minutes a day, then spit it out. The toothpaste, which doesn\u2019t yet have a commercial name, is a product from biotechnology company Intrommune Therapeutics. When people brush their teeth with it, the peanut protein gets absorbed into their mouth. Over time, immune cells in the mouth should become desensitized to the allergen and people\u2019s reactions to peanuts could become less severe. The body \u201cdevelops immunity to that allergen over time,\u201d Berger said, though he noted the toothpaste is only intended to prevent a severe allergic reaction to an accidental exposure to peanuts, and does not serve as a cure to the allergy. All but 3% of all participants continued using either the toothpaste or placebo for the 11-month trial. While 54% of participants who used the toothpaste experienced mild itchiness in the mouth and around the lips, Berger said, nobody dropped out of the study due to side effects. Dr. Edwin Kim, director of the Food Allergy Initiative at the University of North Carolina, said the toothpaste could have an advantage over Palforzia, a powder approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat peanut allergies in children ages 4 to 17. The powder needs to be refrigerated and mixed with foods like applesauce or yogurt. \u201cUnfortunately, what we know with that type of treatment is that side effects including allergic reactions are actually pretty common,\u201d said Kim, who wasn\u2019t involved in the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s already hard enough to be thinking about avoiding your allergen.\u201d Several more treatments for severe peanut allergies are being studied in clinical trials. An October study that Kim led, published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, found that putting a small amount of liquid peanut extract under the tongue desensitized young children to their peanut allergy. By the end of the trial, almost 80% of participating toddlers could tolerate 15 peanuts without allergic symptoms. A late-stage trial in May also showed that a \u201cpeanut patch\u201d helped children ages 1 to 3 tolerate the equivalent of one to four peanuts by helping them absorb small doses of peanut protein through the skin. While about 1 in 50 children in the U.S. have peanut allergies, a 2021 study found that approximately 4.6 million U.S. adults have the allergy, too. Another study from the same year found that U.S. adult peanut allergies have more than tripled over the past two decades, though the reasons for this trend are unclear. Dr. Ruchi Gupta, founding director of the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research at Northwestern University, said it\u2019s important to administer allergy treatments to children as early as possible because that\u2019s when the body\u2019s immune system is the most malleable. Ideally, parents should get their child\u2019s allergy treated in their first year of life, or as soon as it\u2019s discovered, Gupta said. This gives the child the greatest opportunity to reverse the allergy or at least develop a strong tolerance. \u201cI think as people get older, [the allergy] becomes a little bit more set,\u201d said Gupta, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research. Now that the peanut-protein toothpaste seems safe for adults, Berger said, the next step is to test the paste\u2019s safety and effectiveness among children. A pediatric trial involving 80 children between the ages of 4 and 17 is slated to begin next year, Berger said. Berger said he hopes to submit the toothpaste for FDA approval within two or three years, which would require studying it in a larger group of volunteers first. If the toothpaste is ultimately approved, Berger expects it could be available via prescription rather than over the counter. Katie Mogg is an intern at NBC News. ",

        "title": "In a first, a man receives a whole eye transplant after surviving high-voltage electric shock",
        "content": "Surgeons at NYU Langone Health have completed the world\u2019s first whole eye transplant, a groundbreaking advancement many thought was impossible. The patient, Aaron James, 46, a military veteran from Hot Spring Village, Arkansas, cannot see out of the transplanted eye, but he considers the operation a success nonetheless.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start somewhere, and hopefully this will get the ball rolling on future surgeries,\u201d James said in an interview.  In 2021, James survived what should have been a fatal electric shock while he was working as a high-voltage lineman. His face accidentally touched a live wire, causing devastating injuries, including the loss of his left eye, his nose and his lips. Only bone was left in his left cheek and his chin. Much of his left arm was also stripped to the bone.  The operation, which took place in May, lasted 21 hours and required the expertise of more than 140 surgeons, nurses and other health care professionals. In addition to the eye transplant, James also received a partial face transplant, which remains an incredibly rare procedure, with fewer than 50 face transplants having been performed worldwide since the first one in 2005.   The donated face and eye came from a single donor. The eye had never been removed from the donor\u2019s socket, and the surrounding tissue and the optical nerve remained intact.  Still, transplanting the new eye was laborious. Blood vessels surrounding the eye are extremely small, making it a challenge to attach enough for adequate blood flow. Reattaching the optic nerve is another challenge. As part of the operation, the surgeons also injected adult stem cells into James\u2019 optic nerve \u2014 another first \u2014 to prompt the nerve to create healthy new cells. Five months after James\u2019 surgery, there is healthy blood flow to the retina, the part of the back of the eye that converts light into the electric signals the brain converts into images \u2014 a major sign of vitality.  \u201cAlthough there is no sight, we\u2019ve crossed a barrier that many didn\u2019t think was possible,\u201d said Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, the director of the Face Transplant Program at NYU Langone in New York City, who led the surgery. \u201cNothing like this has ever been attempted. There isn\u2019t even any science published in the literature that could indicate what could be the result of such a transplant.\u201d  The eye also has normal pressure, and it is not painful. Infection around the brain was another major complication James was able to avoid in the crucial months after the transplant. His body did not reject the transplant, a significant achievement \u2014 some experts believe the eye has a different immune system from the skin, so it could have been rejected.  \u201cThat is an absolutely remarkable accomplishment in itself,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Rizzo, the director of the neuro-ophthalmology service at Mass Eye and Ear at Mass General Brigham and a professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Rizzo said he believes a whole eye transplant that restores vision is still \u201cbeyond our capabilities at the moment.\u201d \u201cFor one to have sight at the level you\u2019d be able to do something functional, it would require the reconnection of a fair number of nerve cells,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the complexity is not just whether some nerve cells can regrow.\u201d Roughly 1.2 million nerve fibers connect each eye to the brain, and those nerves are not connected in a random fashion. \u201cPoint A has to connect to point A,\u201d Rizzo said. During brain development, a complex system of interactions forms specific pathways that connect points on the retina to points on the brain, he said. The adult brain does not have these same systems, at least not in a robust way.  \u201cThe public should not be imagining that vision will be restored at this point, but from a scientific standpoint, even if they were able to get a small number of nerve cells to grow back to the brain, that would be a groundbreaking accomplishment,\u201d Rizzo said, noting that full vision restoration, if ever possible, is still likely to be a long way from reality.  Rodriguez said that restoring sight in James\u2019 left eye through a whole eye transplant was a moon shot from the get-go but that performing the surgery provided other benefits, as well.  \u201cEven if the eyelids were closed, it would give a better aesthetic than eye sockets that don\u2019t have anything in it,\u201d Rodriguez said. James, who has had many operations since the accident, including one to remove his damaged left eye because of pain, said the face and whole eye transplant has been \u201clife-changing\u201d for him.  \u201cI can go out and I\u2019m really not stared at anymore. I just look like a normal person walking down the street,\u201d he said.  Before the face and eye transplant, James could not taste because of the loss of his nose. He also could not eat solid food. \u201cI just had a little hole in my mouth. My wife had to cook soups and puree them in a blender, and I had to drink them through a straw. That\u2019s the only thing I could eat,\u201d James said.  James said he\u2019s extremely grateful to the donor and the donor\u2019s family. \u201cSomebody had to pass away to make this happen, and the donor and the donor\u2019s family, I can\u2019t imagine having to make a decision like they had to do, and it\u2019s something I think about every day,\u201d James said. \u201cI really want them to know that I\u2019m grateful and I thank them every single day.\u201d Rodriguez will continue to monitor signs of vitality in James\u2019 eye in the coming years. \u201cYou can give a person a little bit of hope and push science forward,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt may open up a new chapter they may not have thought was possible.\u201d Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.

        "title": "What to know about Zepbound, Eli Lilly's new weight loss drug",
        "content": "A new weight loss drug has been approved that promises to be the most effective medication yet. How is Zepbound, the weekly injectable drug that\u2019s expected to be available shortly after Thanksgiving, different from other weight loss medications?   Zepbound, from drugmaker Eli Lilly, belongs to a new class of medications, called GLP-1 agonists, that have skyrocketed in popularity in the U.S. in recent years. Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro are the same type of drugs. Ozempic and Mounjaro are prescribed to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. Wegovy and Zepbound are for people who don\u2019t already have diabetes but whose excess weight puts them at risk of health complications.  In clinical trials, Zepbound helped people lose, on average, 52 pounds, nearly rivaling the weight loss results achieved with bariatric surgery, according to Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.  Here\u2019s what you need to know about Lilly\u2019s new drug.  The active ingredient in Zepbound is tirzepatide, which mimics a hormone that helps reduce food cravings. The diabetes medication Mounjaro also contains tirzepatide. Ozempic and Wegovy contain semaglutide, an ingredient that can suppress appetite by mimicking a hormone that signals to the brain when a person is full. What makes tirzepatide even more helpful is it also imitates a second hormone, called GIP, which \u2014 along with reducing appetite \u2014 may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat, helping to amplify the weight loss effects. In a phase 3 clinical trial, a 15-milligram dose of tirzepatide, the highest dose, led to an average weight loss of 22.5% body weight, or about 52 pounds. The participants in the study had obesity or were overweight with at least one weight-related condition. At lower doses, patients also lost weight: At a 10 mg dosage, the average weight loss was about 21.4%, or about 48 pounds; at 5 mg, patients achieved an average weight loss of around 16%, or about 35 pounds. In similar trials, semaglutide was shown to reduce body weight by around 15%, or about 34 pounds, after 68 weeks. To be sure, these are not direct comparisons because the drugs were not compared in a head-to-head clinical trial. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepbound for use by adults with a body mass index, or BMI, of at least 30 or a BMI of 27 or more if a patient also has another weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, heart disease or obstructive sleep apnea.  The agency said the drug should be used along with a reduced calorie diet and exercise. People who are prescribed the medication should not take another GLP-1 agonists, like Ozempic or Wegovy. Zepbound is only approved for adults 18 and older. Wegovy is approved for people 12 and older. On Zepbound\u2019s label, the FDA notes that the safety and effectiveness of Zepbound have not yet been established in teens or adolescents. McGowan stressed that both medications are highly effective. When deciding between Zepbound and Wegovy, he said patients should consider two factors: insurance coverage and their individual response to each treatment. Lilly has priced Zepbound at about $1,060 for a month\u2019s supply, and while it\u2019s less than Wegovy, which is priced at around $1,300, both drugs may be too expensive for many people who are eligible. Insurance companies often refuse to cover weight loss medications. Medicare, by law, does not cover them. \u201cCost will be a barrier,\u201d said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventative cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Eli Lilly said patients can sign up on its website for a copay, or a discount card program that could help lower the cost of the drug. The company also said that people who are able to get Zepbound through commercial insurance may be eligible to pay as low as $25 for a one-month or three-month supply. People who are commercially insured but do not have coverage for Zepbound may be eligible to pay as low as $550 for a one-month prescription of Zepbound, according to the company. During a briefing Wednesday, the company said it is working with insurers to help more people be able to afford the medication.  Zepbound, like other GLP-1 agonists, can cause uncomfortable side effects, including gastrointestinal problems. According to the FDA\u2019s drug label, side effects include: Other notable side effects include: Generally, people experience those side effects as they ramp up the dosage at the start of treatment, but the side effects usually go away after prolonged use, according to Dr. Daniela Hurtado Andrade, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic.  People who are pregnant should not take the medication. The FDA said patients should also be monitored for depression or suicidal thoughts, and should stop taking Zepbound if symptoms develop. While the Zepbound label does not explicitly mention the risk of stomach paralysis, also called gastroparesis, some patients have reported this complication from other weight loss medications. Doctors in the U.S. should be able to prescribe Zepbound sometime after Thanksgiving, although Lilly executives didn\u2019t say how many doses would be available this year. Given the anticipated high demand, it\u2019s unknown what kinds of shortages people who want the drug will face. The supply is expected to increase through 2024, Lilly said during the Wednesday briefing.   Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "FDA approves weight loss drug from Eli Lilly that helped people lose up to 52 pounds",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Zepbound, a new weight loss drug from drugmaker Eli Lilly that was shown in clinical trials to help people lose up to 52 pounds in 16 months. Zepbound is the latest entrant into the field of powerful new drugs that already includes Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy and Lilly's Mounjaro. The FDA approved the drug for adults with obesity or who are overweight with at least one weight-related condition. In a release, Lilly said Zepbound should be available in the U.S. by the end of the year. It will carry a list price of about $1,060 for a month's supply. The cost may put the new drug out of reach for many people given that insurance companies are often reluctant to cover weight loss medications, and Medicare, by law, does not cover them. \"The current cost is too expensive for the general population,\" Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventative cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. \"We have to be able to get to patients in an affordable way.\" In the United States, 4 in 10 adults have obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although the drug carries a steep price, some analysts have anticipated it will become the best-selling drug in history.  Zepbound is part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which mimic a hormone that helps reduce food intake and appetite. However, Zepbound also imitates a second hormone, called GIP, which \u2014 along with reducing appetite \u2014 may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat. Zepbound shares the same active ingredient \u2014 tirzepatide \u2014 as Lilly\u2019s popular diabetes medication Mounjaro. In a phase 3 clinical trial, Zepbound led to an average weight loss of 22.5% body weight, or about 52 pounds, surpassing all currently available weight loss medications on the market. The participants in the study had obesity or were overweight with at least one weight-related condition. \u201cThis is the most effective form of pharmaceutical obesity treatment ever,\u201d said Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.  He added that the weight loss seen from the medication is approaching the weight loss seen with bariatric surgery.   \u201cThat is a big deal,\u201d he said.   When it comes to whether a patient should choose between Lilly's new drug and Wegovy, McGowan said the key factors to consider are insurance coverage and the patient\u2019s individual response to each treatment. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to a patient, I\u2019m going to discuss both of them,\u201d he said. Like other drugs in its class, however, Zepbound carries a risk of gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation and stomach pain, according to the FDA. The label doesn't specifically mention a risk of stomach paralysis, also called gastroparesis, a more serious complication that some patients have reported as weight loss drugs have skyrocketed in popularity. (In August, Lilly and Novo Nordisk were sued over claims that their blockbuster drugs Mounjaro and Ozempic caused stomach paralysis.) Dr. Daniela Hurtado Andrade, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic, said that while gastrointestinal issues are very common with GLP-1 medications, most of the side effects will not affect a person\u2019s quality of life.  \u201cI\u2019ve had to stop the medications only on very rare occasions,\u201d said Andrade, who prescribes Mounjaro off-label for weight loss. \u201cBut the reality is the majority of patients will be able to find a dose that is not causing significant side effects.\u201d To mitigate side effects, doctors recommend starting patients on a lower dose of the medication and incrementally raising it over a few weeks, she said. \u201cIn general, we titrate the dose up every four weeks,\u201d she said. But \u201cI\u2019ve had patients who have had to stay on the lowest for 12 weeks and then go up and stay on the second dose for another 12 weeks.\u201d Alexis Mitchell, 30 of Charlotte, North Carolina, had been overweight for most of her 20s. It was only last year, following a health scare linked to high blood pressure and prediabetes, that her doctor recommended Mounjaro off-label for weight loss. She began taking a 2.5-milligram weekly dose of Mounjaro and gradually increased it to 15 mg. She started to see results immediately. \u201cFor me, that was a game changer,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cLike OK, you need to change your life around right now. Like, there are no more games.\u201d She has experienced common side effects, including nausea, constipation, migraines, stomach pain and body aches, but the benefits she said have made the discomfort worthwhile. \u201cThe weight loss outweighs the side effects 100% for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m down 123 pounds in a year. I mean, I couldn\u2019t have done it without Mounjaro.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.  Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Newborn syphilis cases have reached 'dire levels,' CDC says",
        "content": "Newborn syphilis cases, which can be fatal, have risen more than tenfold in the last decade and almost 32% in a single year, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Tuesday. The CDC said that cases have reached \u201cdire levels\u201d in the United States. More than 3,700 cases were reported to the agency last year, up from 2,855 in 2021 and 335 cases in 2012. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by bacteria that can linger in the body for many years. If untreated, symptoms may disappear temporarily, but the infection can become active again months or years later. Late-stage syphilis, though rare, can be fatal because of damage to the heart, brain or other organs. Mothers can also pass the disease to their children during pregnancy. This form of the infection, known as congenital syphilis, can potentially result in stillbirth, miscarriage, death or developmental disabilities such as blindness or hearing loss. Last year, 51 cases of congenital syphilis resulted in infant deaths and 231 in stillbirths. But almost 90% of those cases could have been avoided with timely testing and treatment during pregnancy, according to the CDC report. In 40% of cases, there was no evidence that the pregnant person had received prenatal care at all. \u201cIt is unbelievable how this could all be prevented if we just had patients get in for screening and treatment,\u201d said Dr. Irene Stafford, a maternal-fetal medicine physician with UTHealth Houston, who wasn\u2019t involved in the report. Communities of color bear the greatest burden: Babies born to Black, Hispanic or American Indian/Alaska Native mothers in 2021 were up to eight times more likely to have congenital syphilis compared with babies born to white mothers, according to CDC data. The agency recommends that all pregnant women get screened for syphilis via a blood test at their first prenatal care visit. But in an ideal scenario, they would get screened as soon as they see a health care provider, said Dr. Robert McDonald, the report\u2019s lead author and a medical officer in the CDC\u2019s Division of STD Prevention. The report calls for more testing and treatment in emergency departments, prisons and substance use treatment facilities \u2014 settings that see patients with otherwise limited access to health care who are at high risk of syphilis. Those screenings should still be covered by insurance, McDonald said. \u201cWe are recommending that screening really increase for syphilis outside of traditional prenatal care,\u201d he said. Syphilis is a centuries-old infection that has seen a resurgence in the U.S. The CDC said Tuesday that the country is currently seeing the highest number of congenital syphilis cases in more than 30 years. Most syphilis cases in the U.S. are among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. But during the last decade, the infection has spread to more heterosexual men and women. As of 2021, more than 70% of people in the U.S. lived in counties with high rates of syphilis \u2014 more than 4.6 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 among reproductive-age women, according to the CDC. The infection usually begins with a painless sore in the mouth, rectum or genitals, then can progress to more sores or a rash that typically doesn't itch. Stafford said cases during pregnancy often go missed because they can be asymptomatic or nondescript. \u201cSometimes people have a rash and they think it\u2019s dermatitis or they think it\u2019s eczema,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily have a ton of concerning symptoms that a person would associate with an STI, so they often get overlooked.\u201d Many pregnant people aren't even aware that they\u2019re vulnerable to infection, said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the state of Michigan. \u201cMany young women of childbearing age don\u2019t know that syphilis is something that is still around, let alone that they could be at risk and that their unborn baby could be at risk,\u201d she said. Stafford said even some doctors lack awareness. \u201cWhen you ask the average doctor, the average obstetrician, they say, \u2018Syphilis is a problem?\u2019\u201d she said. There are several reasons why pregnant people don't see a regular doctor such as an OB-GYN: They don\u2019t have a car or health insurance, they have a job or caretaking responsibilities, or they struggle to find a provider who speaks their language, Stafford said. Many of these people end up going to the emergency department for their health concerns, said Dr. Kimberly Stanford, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. \u201cWe actually looked at the pregnant woman who utilized our emergency department. Of the ones coming in the first trimester, more than half of them had no plan for prenatal care. They didn\u2019t have an appointment. They didn\u2019t have an OB. They didn\u2019t know how they were going to get one,\" said Stanford, who wasn\u2019t involved in the CDC research. The Covid pandemic made accessing prenatal care even harder for people, which may help explain why congenital syphilis has risen so starkly in the past few years, Bagdasarian said. Many clinics and doctors' offices shortened their hours or switched to virtual visits, which led to fewer STI exams, she said. \u201cCovid made a lot of things worse,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cSyphilis was one of those things that it exacerbated, in part due to less preventative care, routine health care, in-person visits.\u201d Syphilis screenings should be standard practice for people who are sexually active and live in areas with high rates of infection, but few emergency departments routinely test for it. To confirm a diagnosis, doctors typically draw blood and send it off to a lab for testing. Hospitals, however, may not want to perform screenings because they worry they won\u2019t be reimbursed for the cost of blood tests or don't have enough staff to follow up with patients about their results, Stanford said. Her emergency department at the University of Chicago has found ways to overcome those hurdles, she said. For more than four years, it has routinely tested people for syphilis alongside HIV. The program detected high rates of undiagnosed syphilis within roughly the first six months: 97 people were positive out of almost 9,200 screened. \"A lot of facilities will feel like it's going to be extra work. It's going to make a visit take longer, it's going to disrupt the workflow,\" Stanford said. \"One of the things that we found in rolling this out on a really large scale is that most of those barriers really weren't an issue.\" McDonald, the CDC officer, said syphilis screenings can easily be integrated into other programs that regularly test for HIV, such as syringe service programs \u2014 which give people who inject drugs sterile supplies to prevent infection. Testing someone for syphilis doesn't necessarily mean they'll get treated, though: Out of almost 2,200 congenital syphilis cases last year in which the infant's birth parent received timely testing, just 12% received adequate treatment, according to the CDC report. One of the main reasons for that, doctors said, is that patients don't return for a follow-up appointment. \"After people leave the emergency department, they often don't answer their phones,\" Stanford said. \"They can be very difficult to reach again.\" While blood tests are the most common means of diagnosis, hospitals have a second option, McDonald said: Rapid tests involving a finger stick can tell right away whether someone has had syphilis in the past, though the results are less accurate. \u201cFor someone who you think may not be able to make it back in for treatment, that person should be screened with a rapid test and then could be treated there on the spot,\u201d McDonald said. Once pregnant people and their babies are diagnosed, there's only one recommended treatment: an injectable version of penicillin called Bicillin. Mothers often have to return for up to three injections (one per week), and babies usually require an IV for 10 days. The Food and Drug Administration is reporting a shortage of Bicillin right now, but McDonald said the CDC hasn't received any reports of people not being able to access it while pregnant. Stafford said the shortage could be preventing people from receiving immediate treatment though. \u201cWhat I\u2019m noticing is that other clinics who have a hard time getting the penicillin don\u2019t know what to do,\" she said. \"They just try to refer the patient somewhere else, and then that\u2019s a missed opportunity.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "As overdose rates rise, FDA calls for new medications to help curb stimulant addiction",
        "content": "More people in the U.S. are overdosing from cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulants and there's no approved medication to help them get off the drugs. Amid public health warnings about rising stimulant use disorders, the Food and Drug Administration is urging drugmakers to develop treatments for cocaine and methamphetamine addiction. The hope is that it will trigger a rush of clinical trial testing for drug treatments for stimulant use disorder, aiming to fill a major gap in the response to the overdose crisis in the U.S.  Although the FDA has never ruled it out, in draft guidance released last month, the agency expressed openness for the first time to trials for new treatments that reduce the use of cravings for illegal stimulants, rather than solely looking at complete drug abstinence, a move welcomed by addiction specialists. Opioids, mostly fentanyl, continue to be the leading cause of death in the country\u2019s ongoing drug overdose crisis. A growing number of fatalities, however, are linked to stimulants, whether in combination with opioids or on their own, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although there are several drug treatment options such as methadone available for opioids, none have been developed for cocaine, methamphetamine or prescription stimulant addictions. There's renewed urgency to help people with stimulant use disorders as drugs like cocaine and meth have become cheaper, easier to find and more potent. Now, the need for treatments has crashed headlong into a lack of funding and years of limited research that\u2019s produced less-than-inspiring results, experts say. \u201cStopping prolonged stimulant use is extremely difficult without medical help,\u201d said Dr. Ayana Jordan, an addiction psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. There are \u201cmental health challenges and physical withdrawal including stomach and bowel problems, changes in mood, irritability, depression, disordered sleep that happens and people not knowing how to deal with it all alone.\u201d Finding effective treatments for these kinds of substance use disorders is a challenge that could take years, experts say. So far, efforts are off to a slow start.  \u201cIf you look at clinicaltrials.gov,\u201d said Marta Sokolowska, the deputy center director for substance use and behavioral health in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, \u201cand you compare the number of clinical trials for stimulant use disorder versus other disorders, such as oncology, you will see that the number of clinical trials are not maybe as great as it could be.\u201d  Jordan had a more blunt assessment.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that I have seen on the horizon or even clinical trials that are promising,\u201d Jordan said. Stimulants, such as cocaine and meth, elevate levels of a chemical in the brain called dopamine, which is responsible for regulating mood and producing feelings of pleasure and euphoria. Over time, these drugs can alter the brain\u2019s reward system \u2014 a complex network responsible for pleasure, motivation and reinforcing behaviors \u2014 leading to addiction and causing structural changes in the brain associated with memory and decision-making. Similar to opioids, \u201cit totally takes over our natural reward system,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cso people behave in a way that is not consistent with normal functioning.\u201d  It\u2019s a \u201cdelicate balance\u201d finding effective treatments, Jordan said, noting that a drug for stimulant use disorders would ideally bring the brain back to its natural state without causing further damage to it, a goal that scientists have yet to achieve with stellar results. What\u2019s more, unlike opioids, there is unlikely to be a universal treatment approach for stimulant use disorders. Cocaine and methamphetamine, for example, both increase levels of dopamine in the brain, albeit through different processes. As a result, people using cocaine may respond and behave very differently from those using methamphetamine. There\u2019s no \u201csingle magic bullet,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Herring, the chief of addiction medicine at Alameda Health System in Oakland. \u201cThis is an incredibly complex disorder that is different in every person and within every person is different day to day.\u201d To address the overdose crisis, Sokolowska said the FDA initially focused its attention on developing treatments for opioid use disorders, but it later \u201cbecame very clear and very apparent\u201d that the crisis had shifted and changed to include stimulants. In 2021, about 1.6 million people ages 12 and up in the U.S. had a methamphetamine use disorder and 1.4 million had a cocaine use disorder, according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In the last 12 months leading up to May of this year, there were over 34,000 methamphetamine-related deaths and over 28,000 cocaine-related deaths. In the draft guidance, the FDA encouraged drug companies to launch clinical trials for cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulant addictions. Promising drugs could qualify for expedited approval through the FDA\u2019s fast-track process, the agency said. Given the complexities of addiction \u2014 for example, people may use multiple illicit drugs, different amounts and methods \u2014 participants in clinical trials may need to be monitored for at least six months before they're considered drug free, according the FDA guidance. \u201cStimulant use disorder, it\u2019s a really broad group of disorders,\u201d Sokolowska said. \u201cThere are different patterns of use. There are also differences in long-term effects of using these substances, which is part the reason why it\u2019s been so challenging to date to develop and to review and approve effective treatments.\u201d Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction specialist at MassGeneral Hospital for Children in Boston, said the FDA\u2019s draft guidance for developing drugs is a big deal.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot to go on in terms of clinical guidelines,\u201d Hadland said.  There have been previous studies that showed promise in treating stimulant use disorder, but the results have been less than satisfying, he said.  A study published in 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the use of naltrexone in combination with bupropion to treat methamphetamine use disorder. Naltrexone is commonly prescribed to treat opioid and alcohol use disorders, while bupropion is an antidepressant known for reducing cravings for cigarettes. The study \u2014 which included about 400 patients randomized to receive the treatment or a placebo \u2014 found that about 14% of participants who got the combination treatment consistently tested negative for methamphetamine in their urine, compared to only 2.5% of those who got placebos. That means for every nine or so patients who got the combination treatment, just one had a favorable response, Hadland said. \u201cIt was sort of underwhelming,\u201d Hadland said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of the story of all these trials that have been done.\u201d Michael McDonell, an associate professor of community and behavioral health at Washington State University, said research teams throughout the U.S. have been trying to find a medication that works for stimulant drugs for more than 40 years. Unfortunately, he said, the drugs developed so far haven\u2019t been as successful as methadone and buprenorphine were for opioids. One example, he said, included a cocaine vaccine from researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cIt worked, but not overwhelmingly,\u201d McDonell said. \u201cI am not optimistic that we will find a medication for stimulant drugs that is as effective as medications for opioid use disorder.\u201d Jordan noted the potential use of monoclonal antibodies that are designed to prevent substances, like cocaine and meth, from binding to receptors in the brain, although those are still in the early phase of development. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for prime time at all,\u201d she said. In fact, the most successful approaches for helping people dealing with stimulant addiction so far have centered around behavioral interventions, rather than medications, Hadland said. \u201cYou basically incentivize people to not have positive urine drug tests,\u201d he said.  In California, for example, people are rewarded for negative drug tests with cash \u2014 up to $599 over six months \u2014 under the state\u2019s so-called contingency management program. Similar approaches have been successful in helping people lose weight, quit smoking and change other behaviors. \u201cIf it was a medication, the FDA would have approved it 30 years ago,\u201d McDonell said, referring to the approach. Patients who undergo contingency management, he said, are two to three times more likely to stop using stimulants, compared to patients who don\u2019t receive the intervention. But Herring said that while that approach may work for some people, it still doesn\u2019t get at the biological causes of addiction. \u201cWhat actually leads to disorder is this complex congregation of psychological, psychiatric, cardiovascular and emotional events,\u201d he said. Scientists are just at the beginning of discovering treatments, Herring said, noting that research so far has not been adequately funded. \u201cMost people caring for people suffering from substance use disorders, particularly stimulants, are working in really scandalously underfunded situations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like how we treated chest pain 50 years ago or 100 years ago before we even understood atherosclerosis and plaque rupture and myocardial infraction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very focused about the fact that it\u2019s not only about abstinences,\u201d Sokolowska said. Other endpoints that could be examined, she said, include changing the patterns of use of stimulants or changing the disease status. Reduced cocaine use, while not ideal, could still be considered a positive development, for example. The FDA is diligently working to increase the availability and accessibility of treatments for substance use disorder. \u201cThere is uncertainty because the impact of stimulants on humans is not as well studied as we had hoped,\u201d Sokolowska said. The FDA will accept comments on its draft guidance until Dec. 4.  \u201cIt\u2019s our priority to address this very, very important medical need,\u201d Sokolowska said. \u201cWe are open for business.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "How lawmakers in Texas and Florida undermine Covid vaccination efforts",
        "content": "Katherine Wells wants to urge her Lubbock, Texas, community to get vaccinated against Covid-19. \u201cThat could really save people from severe illness,\u201d said Wells, the city\u2019s public health director. But she can\u2019t. A rule added to Texas\u2019 budget that went into effect Sept. 1 forbids health departments and other organizations funded by the state government to advertise, recommend, or even list covid vaccines alone. \u201cClinics may inform patients that COVID-19 vaccinations are available,\u201d the rule allows, \u201cif it is not being singled out from other vaccines.\u201d Texas isn\u2019t the only state curtailing the public conversation about Covid vaccines. Tennessee\u2019s health department homepage, for example, features the flu, vaping, and cancer screening but leaves out Covid and Covid vaccines. Florida is an extreme case, where the health department has issued guidance against Covid vaccines that runs counter to scientific studies and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Notably, the shift in health information trails rhetoric from primarily Republican politicians who have reversed their positions on covid vaccines. Fierce opposition to measures like masking and business closures early in the pandemic fueled a mistrust of the CDC and other scientific institutions and often falls along party lines: Last month, a KFF poll found that 84% of Democrats said they were confident in the safety of covid vaccines, compared with 36% of Republicans. It\u2019s a dramatic drop from 2021, when two-thirds of Republicans were vaccinated. As new vaccines roll out ahead of the expected winter surge of Covid, some health officials are treading carefully to avoid blowback from the public and policymakers. So far, vaccine uptake is low, with less than 5% of Americans receiving an updated shot, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Wells fears the consequences will be dire: \u201cWe will see a huge disparity in health outcomes because of changes in language.\u201d A study published in July found that Republicans and Democrats in Ohio and Florida died at roughly similar rates before Covid vaccines emerged, but a disparity between parties grew once the first vaccines were widely available in 2021 and uptake diverged. By year\u2019s end, Republicans had a 43% higher rate of excess deaths than Democrats. Public health initiatives have long been divisive \u2014 water fluoridation, needle exchanges, and universal health care, to name a few. But the pandemic turned up the volume to painful levels, public health officials say. More than 500 left their jobs under duress in 2020 and 2021, and legislators in at least 26 states passed laws to prevent public officials from setting health policies. Republican Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner told KFF Health News in 2021, \u201cIt\u2019s time to take the power away from the so-called experts.\u201d At first, vaccine mandates were contentious but the shots themselves were not. Scott Rivkees, Florida\u2019s former surgeon general, now at Brown University, traces the shift to the months after Joe Biden was elected president. Though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis initially promoted Covid vaccination, his stance changed as resistance to Covid measures became central to his presidential campaign. In late 2021, he appointed Joseph Ladapo surgeon general. By then, Ladapo had penned Wall Street Journal op-eds skeptical of mainstream medical advice, such as one asking, \u201cAre Covid Vaccines Riskier Than Advertised?\u201d As bivalent boosters rolled out last year, the Florida health department\u2019s homepage removed information on Covid vaccines. In its place were rules against mandates and details on how to obtain vaccine exemptions. Then, early this year, the department advised against vaccinating children and teens. The state\u2019s advice changed once more when the CDC recommended updated covid vaccines in September. DeSantis incorrectly said the vaccines had \u201cnot been proven to be safe or effective.\u201d And the health department amended its guidance to say men under age 40 should not be vaccinated because the department had conducted research and deemed the risk of heart complications like myocarditis unacceptable. It refers to a short, authorless document posted online rather than in a scientific journal where it would have been vetted for accuracy. The report uses an unusual method to analyze health records of vaccinated Floridians. Citing serious flaws, most other researchers call it misinformation. Scientifically vetted studies, and the CDC\u2019s own review, contradict Florida\u2019s conclusion against vaccination. Cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines have occurred but are much less frequent than cases triggered by covid. The risk is sevenfold higher from the disease than from mRNA vaccines, according to an analysis published in a medical journal based on a review of 22 other studies. Since leaving his post, Rivkees has been stunned to see the state health department subsumed by political meddling. About 28,700 children and adults from birth to age 39 have died of Covid in the United States. Florida\u2019s anti-vaccine messaging affects people of all ages, Rivkees added, not just those who are younger. He points out that Florida performed well compared with other states in 2020 and 2021, ranking 38th in Covid deaths per capita despite a large population of older adults. Now it has the sixth-highest rate of Covid deaths in the country. \u201cThere is no question that the rise of misinformation and the politicization of the response has taken a toll on public health,\u201d he said. As in Florida, the Texas health department initially promoted Covid vaccines, warning that Texans who weren\u2019t vaccinated were about 20 times as likely to suffer a Covid-associated death. Such sentiments faded last year, as state leaders passed policies to block vaccine mandates and other public health measures. The latest is a prohibition against the use of government funds to promote Covid vaccines. Uptake in Texas is already low, with fewer than 4% of residents getting the bivalent booster that rolled out last year. At Lubbock\u2019s health department, Wells managed to put out a press release saying the city offers Covid vaccines but stopped short of recommending them. \u201cWe aren\u2019t able to do as big a push as other states,\u201d she said. Some health officials are altering their recommendations, given the current climate. Janet Hamilton, executive director at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said clear-cut advice to get vaccinated against Covid works when people trust the scientific establishment, but it risks driving others away from all vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s important for public health to meet people where they are,\u201d Hamilton said. Missouri\u2019s health department took this tack on X, formerly known as Twitter: \u201cCOVID vaccines will be available in Missouri soon, if you\u2019re in to that sort of thing. If not, just keep scrolling!\u201d KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

        "title": "Kids who survive gun injuries suffer increases in pain and psychiatric disorders, study finds",
        "content": "Survivors of gun injuries often face a long, painful recovery. When the gun victims are children or teens, family members also struggle. In the year following a firearm injury, child and adolescent survivors endured significant increases in pain, psychiatric and substance use disorders compared to their peers, according to research published Monday in the journal Health Affairs. The mental health of family members also was affected. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat injuries like this in isolation without thinking about all the factors that are occurring in the aftermath,\u201d said Dr. Patrick Carter, an emergency medicine physician and co-director of the University of Michigan Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention. Carter was not involved in the study. Researchers from Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed 15 years of claims data from employer-sponsored health insurance plans. They looked at claims for 2,052 survivors of firearm injuries \u2014 from infants through 19-year-olds \u2014 during the year before and the year after the injury. They then compared the data to health insurance claims from nearly 10,000 matched controls who were not injured by a firearm. Through one year after a firearm injury, children and teens experienced a 117% increase in pain disorders, a 68% increase in psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, anxiety, depression and psychosis, and a 144% increase in substance use disorders relative to the controls. \u201cOur results suggest that the struggles of the survivors on a daily basis to recover, to heal, to get by and make it to the next day is a challenging road,\u201d said Dr. Zirui Song, one of the paper\u2019s authors and a primary care physician and associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks gun deaths in the U.S., but there is no official data on nonfatal firearm injuries. In the new study, it's estimated that more than 85,000 people in the U.S. survive firearm injuries each year \u2014 roughly double the number of firearm deaths \u2014 although the proportion that are children is not known.  The researchers also compared health insurance claims of survivors\u2019 parents and siblings to family members of kids who did not suffer a firearm injury. Mothers of survivors experienced a 30% increase in psychiatric disorders and fathers a 31% increase, relative to controls. \u201cThis illustrates the shared trauma experienced by families,\u201d said Song. His analysis also showed that moms of survivors may be neglecting their own health care. Their routine office visits fell by 6%, imaging by 14% and laboratory tests by 9% relative to controls. In the study, siblings of children and teens with firearm injuries did not show an increase in mental health diagnoses and services. The data does not offer an explanation, but Song and his colleagues have a hypothesis.  \u201cSiblings may be staying in their rooms on the phone and on the internet, avoiding social interaction, coping in a way that may not be healthy and is less visible to the health care system,\u201d said Song. In other words, they may not be getting the appropriate care they need. The results provide more evidence of the need for clinicians, communities and policy makers to direct mental health resources to survivors and their families, experts say. The researchers limited their study to one year before and one year after a firearm injury because a longer study would have been less rigorous. It would have meant following fewer people as employees leave their jobs. Pediatrician Dr. Katherine Hoops, a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said the struggle for survivors and family members likely continues beyond the year after the initial injury. \u201cIn my own experience walking alongside families after violent injuries, these things never go away or they take a long time for a family, a community or an individual to cope with,\u201d said Hoops, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIf you talk to someone who has been shot, who has had a child or family member shot or who has lost a family member to gun violence, they will have no trouble telling you about the longer-term physical, emotional, mental and economic costs,\u201d said Dr. Elinore Kaufman, a trauma surgeon and the medical director for the Penn Trauma Violence Recovery Program at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia. For Keely Roberts, who with her son Cooper was among the victims of the July 4, 2022 shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, recovery sometimes feels like \u201ctwo steps forward\u201d followed by \u201cmoments where it\u2019s three steps back.\u201d  Cooper, then 8, was paralyzed and now uses a wheelchair. Roberts said Cooper tries so hard to be positive, but, like the children in the study, he is struggling to cope with the aftermath of the shooting. \u201cEverything about our life has been just destroyed, and his little tiny body is just so hurt,\u201d Roberts said in an interview. Being back in school is a comfort for Cooper but also a source of anxiety, sorrow and grief, Roberts said. \u201cHe was so happy to see his friends and that brought him tremendous comfort, but it also was a reminder of what was stolen from him, what was taken so painfully away from him.\u201d Roberts said the school and community have been tremendously supportive, as have her son\u2019s medical providers who told the family from day one that there would be mental health challenges ahead. Counseling has helped everyone in the family, she said, although progress is uneven. And like the mothers in the new research, Roberts has neglected her own routine health care. She has taken a leave from work to get Cooper the care he needs, but \u201cthere are only so many hours in the day and something has to give,\u201d she said. Not surprisingly, the study showed that health care costs climbed with a firearm injury. Health care spending increased $2,907 a month, on average, for each child and adolescent survivor, compared to controls. An estimated 5% of added spending came out of patients\u2019 pockets. Insurance picked up 95%. The study had several limitations, according to the researchers. For example, claims data was drawn only from commercial health insurance. But a large proportion of people who experience firearm injuries either have Medicaid \u2014 government health insurance for adults and children with limited income and resources \u2014 or are uninsured, said Kaufman. Firearm violence is heavily concentrated among populations with low resources and people of color because of \"structural racism and disenfranchisement in the United States,\" Kaufman said. \u201cSo this study is not representing the most vulnerable population,\u201d she added. Song and his colleagues are currently undertaking a similar study among Medicaid recipients. Despite its limitations, Carter, from the University of Michigan, said the new research is an important contribution that will inform the discussion around firearm violence, especially the need to invest in prevention.  \u201cIf we can prevent firearm injuries, then we avoid all these huge physical, mental health and economic costs that occur in their wake,\u201d said Carter.

        "title": "Gay couples turn to crowdfunding to raise money for fertility costs",
        "content": "The high cost of surrogacy, an increasingly popular option for couples looking to expand their families biologically, has led some prospective same-sex parents to turn to crowdfunding.  Kyle and Jack Maurelli, a gay couple living in New York state, began a GoFundMe campaign in July after their insurance company told them they didn\u2019t qualify for the infertility coverage necessary to cover the cost of an embryo transplant. Having a baby through surrogacy can cost up to $250,000, according to Family Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ families.  \u201cWe successfully created embryos, however, our path to parenthood has been fraught with financial challenges due to the exorbitant expenses associated with fertility treatments like surrogacy and in vitro fertilization (IVF),\u201d the Maurellis, who married in 2019, wrote on their GoFundMe page. \u201cDespite both of us working tirelessly, the overwhelming burden of these costs totaling approximately 180K and climbing is proving to be an insurmountable obstacle.\u201d The couple\u2019s insurance company, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, told NBC News NOW that it \u201ccovers fertility services as mandated by New York state law.\u201d On the state\u2019s website, infertility is defined, in part, as \u201cthe incapacity to impregnate another person or to conceive, due to the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or therapeutic donor insemination, or after six months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse or therapeutic donor insemination for an individual who can conceive at 35 years of age or older.\u201d This would not apply to male same-sex couples.  \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel fair; it feels discriminatory,\u201d Jack Maurelli said of infertility definitions like the one used by New York state.  He added, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a stigma that two men can\u2019t raise a child together or that men are incapable of raising children on their own, and it\u2019s something we want to stop.\u201d  Kyle Maurelli noted that if he were in a heterosexual marriage, he and his spouse could get up to $100,000 worth of fertility treatments through his health insurer.  When asked about the couple\u2019s interactions with Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kyle Maurelli said, \u201cThey have said things like, \u2018You\u2019re not infertile and your husband\u2019s not infertile, so the two of you can naturally reproduce with females that are fertile.\u2019\u201d The Maurellis, who said they\u2019ve already spent about $65,000 on fertility costs, said they expect surrogacy to cost another $180,000. They said they\u2019ve taken out loans against their home and have gotten second jobs to help with the cost. So far, the men have raised about $5,000 of their $50,000 fundraising goal on GoFundMe. Currently, 20 states besides New York, plus Washington, D.C., have laws requiring coverage for infertility, according to Resolve: The National Infertility Association, and at least 15 of those laws mandate coverage for in vitro fertilization.

        "title": "These 'Essential 8' habits slowed biological aging significantly, study shows",
        "content": "A 41-year-old who follows most of the guidelines for a healthy heart may have an actual biological age of 36. Then there\u2019s the 53-year-old who doesn\u2019t get enough sleep, doesn\u2019t exercise regularly and has high levels of bad cholesterol who may actually have a biological age closer to 57, according to a new analysis presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association on Monday. Biological aging may be slowed significantly when people adopt the eight behaviors recommended by the heart association, dubbed \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8,\u201d the report from Columbia University researchers found. Data from more than 6,500 adults showed there could be up to five years\u2019 difference between people\u2019s chronological age and their biological age, also known as phenotypical age, if they incorporate all eight recommendations into their daily lives. Phenotypical age is calculated by combining a person\u2019s actual age with the levels of nine markers in the blood collected as part of a typical annual physical. Previous research has shown that phenotypical age correlates well with a person\u2019s risk for premature death. Among the blood levels that play a role in determining a person\u2019s biological age are those that indicate liver, kidney and immune system health, risk for diabetes, and level of inflammation. The \u201cEssential 8,\u201d based on guidance from the heart association: \u201cBy improving heart health we can slow down our bodies\u2019 aging process,\u201d said study author Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. \u201cAnother important message is that what we observed was dose dependent, which means that as heart health goes up, biological aging goes down.\u201d The research shows that even gradual changes can improve heart health and slow down aging, Makarem said. \u201cThe cool thing is there are eight health factors and behaviors that are modifiable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a very hopeful message.\u201d What\u2019s nice about this study is that it shows that by doing things for your heart, you also see improvements in other organs, like the liver and the kidneys, said cardiologist Dr. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Health. Knowing that following the eight recommendations can make a person age more slowly may inspire some to try to improve their lifestyles, said Weintraub. \u201cWhen I tell a 30-year-old patient that their carotid artery looks like that of a 55-year-old, it gets their attention,\u201d he added. The size of the benefit in terms of biological age was surprising to Dr. Annapoorna Kini, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City. \u201cWe used to think that heart health was 50% inherited and 50% lifestyle,\u201d she said, adding that the study suggests that lifestyle may be even more important than genetic inheritance. Still, Kini said, more research is needed to verify the results. If a larger study that follows people over time validates the findings, \u201cit may be a game changer,\u201d she said.

        "content": "Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin returned to Cincinnati on Sunday night, about 10 months after he collapsed and nearly died during a nationally televised game. Hamlin, 25, went into cardiac arrest early in the Bills-Bengals \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup at Cincinnati\u2019s Paycor Stadium on Jan. 2, leading the crucial Week 17 game to be declared a no contest. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition and has since been cleared to play football again. Hamlin has been effusive in his appreciation of the Bills\u2019 medical team and first responders in Cincinnati who played key roles in saving his life. He has started a charitable foundation to award scholarships to needy children in Cincinnati. Hamlin was not on the active roster for Sunday night's game. He's played sparingly this season, getting into just one game so far, Buffalo\u2019s 48-20 win Oct. 1 against the Miami Dolphins. The scheduling of Sunday\u2019s game is a bit of random circumstance. NFL teams are guaranteed to play their three division opponents twice a season. The rest of the contests are based on a formula that rotates opponents and brings parity to the league, with teams playing other clubs of similar strength. While the Bills and the Bengals are not scheduled to meet every season, they have been consistent rivals in recent years, with Buffalo holding a 17-16 lifetime edge in a series that dates to 1968.

        "title": "2 more companies recall fruit puree pouches over potential lead contamination",
        "content": "Federal health officials are expanding an investigation into potentially lead-tainted pouches of apple cinnamon fruit puree marketed for children amid reports of more illnesses and additional product recalls. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has received reports of seven illnesses in at least five states possibly linked to contaminated puree. Two new companies, Schnucks Markets of St. Louis and Weis Markets of Sunbury, Pennsylvania, announced recalls of certain cinnamon applesauce products because they may contain high levels of lead. WanaBana of Coral Gables, Florida, previously recalled of all lots and expiration dates of its apple cinnamon fruit puree. Eating the contaminated products could result in \u201cacute toxicity,\u201d FDA officials said. Parents and caregivers should not buy or serve the cinnamon applesauce products, which are sold through multiple retailers, including Amazon, Dollar Tree and at Schnucks and Eatwell Markets grocery stores. Children and others who have consumed the products should be tested for possible lead poisoning, the agency said. The investigation began in North Carolina, where health officials are looking into reports of four children with elevated blood levels linked to the WanaBana product. State health officials analyzed multiple lots of the product and detected \u201cextremely high\u201d concentrations of lead. The FDA confirmed the results. The FDA\u2019s Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network is leading the investigation in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health officials. Lead is toxic to people of all ages, but can be especially harmful to children. Most children have no obvious symptoms, so it\u2019s important that kids who are exposed get tested to check levels of lead in their blood. Short-term exposure to lead can result in symptoms that include headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and anemia, the FDA said. Heavy metals like lead can get into food products from soil, air, water or industrial processes, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Lead exposure can seriously harm children\u2019s health, causing damage to the brain and nervous system and slowed growth and development. There is no known safe level of lead exposure, the AAP said.

The recall is specifically for the 29-ounce plastic bags of the product officially called Fully Cooked Fun Nuggets Breaded Shaped Chicken Patties, the FSIS said in a release. Approximately 29,819 pounds of the Fun Nuggets are impacted, according to the release.

        "title": "Feeling angry may help people achieve their goals, study finds",
        "content": "If you want to achieve your goals, get angry.  New research indicates that anger can help people overcome challenges or obstacles that might get in the way of their ambitions. A study published this week in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants who completed a variety of challenging tasks in a state of anger performed better than participants who felt other emotions such as sadness, desire or amusement.  Heather Lench, the lead author of the study and a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Texas A&M University, said the findings suggest that people can use anger as a motivator.  \u201cWe found that anger led to better outcomes in situations that were challenging and involved obstacles to goals,\u201d Lench said. But anger did not improve people\u2019s performances when it came to easier assignments, according to the study. The study consisted of six experiments, each testing whether anger helped people achieve specific tasks. Lench said the most interesting outcome came from the first experiment, which measured the number of word puzzles participants could solve in different states of emotion. That experiment involved 233 undergraduate students at Texas A&M. Each student was randomly assigned one emotion: anger, desire, sadness, amusement or a neutral state. To elicit the emotion, they were shown a series of images for five seconds per image. Those assigned to anger were shown insults about the school\u2019s football team, for example.  Next, the participants had 20 minutes to unscramble as many words as possible from four sets of seven anagrams displayed on a computer screen. The sets varied in difficulty, and once participants moved on from a puzzle, they couldn\u2019t return to try again. A computer program recorded how long participants spent on each puzzle. The results showed that angry participants solved more puzzles than participants feeling any other emotion. Most notably, angry students completed 39% more puzzles than students feeling neutral. Participants feeling angry also demonstrated greater persistence by spending more time trying to solve the puzzles, Lench said.  \u201cWhen people were angry and they persisted, they were more likely to succeed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in all the other emotional states, when they persisted, they were more likely to fail. So it seems to suggest that people were persistent more effectively when they were angry.\u201d Other experiments tested whether anger could motivate students to sign a petition, help them earn high scores on a video game, or prompt them to cheat on logic and reasoning puzzles in order to win prizes.   Across all challenging situations, participants in the angry state were more likely to attain the desired goal. Not all forms of anger are useful for achieving goals, according to psychology experts.  Intense anger is sometimes associated with physical responses like sweaty palms, difficulty breathing and a rapid heart rate. A 2022 study from the European Heart Journal found that anger may contribute to the development of certain cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart failure in men and in people with diabetes. A 2021 study from the same journal found acute anger was associated with the onset of strokes.  During a lover\u2019s spat, anger could lead to aggressive and belittling communication that may harm the relationship, Lench said. But it could also help someone articulate their needs if their goal is to feel heard and supported by their partner. \u201cAnger can be motivating. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we turn thinking off,\u201d Lench said. \u201cSo when we feel angry, stopping and thinking about why we\u2019re angry is probably an important step too.\u201d If taken too far, severe bouts of anger can degrade one\u2019s ability to accomplish tasks, said Raymond Tafrate, a clinical psychologist and professor in the department of criminology and criminal justice at Central Connecticut State University. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a middle ground. Some anger is helpful, but there is that other side that I think we need to talk about as well,\u201d said Tafrate, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research. \u201cAnger that\u2019s sort of mild or on the moderate end of the spectrum is probably life-enhancing for many people.\u201d The key is to embrace anger as a potentially useful emotion rather than try to avoid it, Tafrate said. \u201cAnger can be an important signal that things aren\u2019t going well and that you need to make a change,\u201d Tafrate said.  Communicating one\u2019s anger right away in social situations could even encourage others to listen to your perspective and increase the chances of coming to a resolution, said Todd Kashdan, a psychology professor at George Mason University, who also wasn\u2019t part of the new research. \u201cI call this the discomfort caveat, and it just lets the other person know that you don\u2019t want to be judged for how you phrase things. You just want them to know that there\u2019s a problem here, you recognize that you want to point it out, and you want to offer an alternative,\u201d Kashdan said. \u201cThen what happens is you\u2019re bringing their defenses down.\u201d  Even if your words come out biting or aggressive, Kashdan said, people may still be receptive to your concerns.

        "title": "When should you come out of Covid isolation? Experts weigh in",
        "content": "Covid symptoms may change, but the appearance of a pink line on a rapid test means one thing for sure: five days of isolation. The guidance, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been in place since late 2021. At the moment, the agency doesn\u2019t appear to be making any changes to the policy. But in some cases, telling people to isolate after a positive test may have an unintended effect.  Dr. Victoria Valencia, interim director for the Health Center for Student Care at Tulane University in New Orleans, said that she and her staff saw an uptick in Covid when students returned to campus in August. But that is no longer the case, as students now tend to decline Covid testing.  \u201cStudents are afraid of being diagnosed with Covid\u201d because they don\u2019t want to isolate, Valencia said. So is five days of isolation really best? Here\u2019s what experts say. The current recommendation to isolate for five days is a \u201changover\u201d from when the CDC moved from a 10-day isolation recommendation to five days in late 2021, just as the first wave of omicron was taking hold in the U.S., said Harvard University epidemiologist Bill Hanage. \u201cIt was not a reflection of evidence-based\u201d science, he said. \u201cIt was there to stop everything from falling apart.\u201d At that time, a large chunk of the population was testing positive all at once because of the highly contagious variant. Recommending that everyone stay home \u2014 and out of work \u2014 for 10 days would have brought the country to a halt once again, so the five-day plan was put in place. \u201cIf you look at the safety of the public, and the need to have society not disrupted, this was a good choice,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, former scientific adviser to the Biden administration, said at the time about the isolation recommendation. There was also evidence that people are most contagious during those first five days of infection. That remains the most reliable scientific data, experts say. \u201cWe know that most people with Covid-19 shed enough virus that they are likely still contagious for at least five days,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, wrote in an email. When the Covid public health emergency expired in May 2023, health officials in Oregon decided it was also time to pull back on the five-day isolation recommendation. Instead, the Oregon Health Authority suggested that people with Covid stay home only until they\u2019ve gone without spiking a fever for 24 hours and are generally feeling better. No other states have followed Oregon in rolling back isolation recommendations. \u201cThe ending of the public health emergency declaration doesn\u2019t change biology,\u201d Nuzzo wrote at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t see a biological reason to end the five-day isolation period.\u201d People with the flu are most contagious the first three or four days after the illness begins, according to the CDC. People who test positive for influenza are advised to stay home \u201cuntil at least 24 hours after their fever is gone\u201d without the use of fever-reducing drugs, such as Tylenol. A common cold virus is most contagious within the first few days but can continue to spread for up to two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital research. Like other viruses, people with Covid have varying degrees of sickness. A set number of days to isolate is \u201cdumb if you think about it from a medical perspective,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling fine the entire five days and have absolutely no symptoms, staying at home by yourself is not the same as somebody who\u2019s had symptoms and then after five days, they\u2019re going out and coughing on everyone,\u201d Chin-Hong said. \u201cThe symptoms approach makes more sense, not just for Covid, but for lots of other infectious diseases that people don\u2019t normally isolate for.\u201d Saskia Popescu, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said that while a person\u2019s risk of spreading Covid is in the first five days of infection, \u201cwe know increasingly, that even without symptoms, or upon their resolution, people can still shed infectious virus.\u201d Popescu said that means that while the risk is lower after Day 5, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s zero risk. \u201cYou should still try and stay home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you absolutely need to, you can wear a mask.\u201d \u201cCovid is a very unique infectious disease,\u201d Popescu added. \u201cForty to 50% of cases are asymptomatic, or have such mild symptoms that people don\u2019t even realize they have symptoms.\u201d In a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in October, researchers found that children ages 7 to 18 were infectious for a median of three days after a positive Covid test. By Day 5, the majority of the kids were no longer infectious.  \u201cMy personal view is that five days is more than sufficient\u201d for isolation, said senior study author Neeraj Sood, a professor of health policy, medicine and business at University of Southern California. Based on the findings, \u201cmaybe you could go with something a little shorter for kids.\u201d An earlier study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2022, found that adults were infectious for a median of five or six days. Popescu, who wasn\u2019t involved with either study, said the findings on children will probably be used moving forward for a lot of school-based decisions.  \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to see the three days,\u201d Popescu said. On an individual level, common sense should rule, Hanage said. If you\u2019re sick, stay away from people most at risk for severe complications, such as older relatives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to give them something that would make them badly ill \u2014 whether it\u2019s Covid, flu or even food poisoning,\u201d he said. Popescu agreed.  \u201cFrom an infectious disease perspective, we want people to stay home if they have symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just because you don\u2019t have Covid doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have another infectious disease that could pose a risk to those around you.\u201d Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist and former assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, urged people to do the best they can and take precautions where possible. \"Nobody's perfect,\" Mina said. \"If you can decrease your chances of spreading to others, that's really good. That alone is very, very good. So if you can't isolate for five days, or it's been five days, but you recognize that you might still be infectious, wear a mask as much as you can, don't attend really densely packed events, and stay away from vulnerable people.\" CORRECTION (June 12, 2023, 11:15 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Jennifer Nuzzo\u2019s title and employer.

        "title": "RFK Jr. comes \u2018home\u2019 to his anti-vaccine group, commits to \u2018a break\u2019 for U.S. infectious disease research",
        "content": "At an anti-vaccine conference in Georgia on Friday, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed his commitment to the cause and spoke to his base about how he, as president, would serve the movement he built. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come home today,\u201d he said to a standing ovation, crediting the assembled audience with his candidacy. He then laid out his vision for a Kennedy presidency, which would include telling the National Institutes of Health to take \u201ca break\u201d from studying infectious diseases, like Covid-19 and measles, and pivoting the agency to the study of chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity. Kennedy has suggested without evidence that researchers and pharmaceutical companies are driven by profit to neglect such chronic conditions and invest in ineffective and even harmful treatments; he includes vaccines among them. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say to NIH scientists, God bless you all,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThank you for public service. We\u2019re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s remarks came at the end of the first day of a conference for the country\u2019s largest anti-vaccine organization, Children\u2019s Health Defense. Kennedy signed on with Children\u2019s Health Defense in 2015 and served as its chairman and chief litigation counsel until April, when he announced he would go on leave to run for president. Currently running as an independent candidate, Kennedy is polling favorably among voters across the political spectrum. In a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, according to a Quinnipiac University poll this week, Kennedy received 22% support against Biden (39%) and Trump (36%). Kennedy has mostly shied away from anti-vaccine advocacy on the campaign trail and has said, despite years of public statements to the contrary, that he is not opposed to vaccines. This spring, he told NBC News vaccines were \u201cnot an issue that I\u2019m leading with.\u201d A representative for Children\u2019s Health Defense declined my request to attend the conference in person, citing my record of \u201creporting on CHD\u2019s themes and activities.\u201d NBC News paid $275 for a virtual ticket and watched the conference via a livestream provided to remote attendees. In the hourlong speech, Kennedy covered well-worn subjects, railing against the evils of pharmaceutical companies, warning against researchers who he said improperly frame scientific findings for profit, and expounding on conspiracy theories around Covid measures, including what he called the \u201ctotalitarian regime\u201d that controls public health and censorship of dissenting voices. Referring to vaccines, he said to the mothers in the audience: \u201cYou have a duty to do research when you\u2019re giving your child a medical intervention.\u201d In addition to his proposed moves at NIH, Kennedy said that as president, he\u2019d appoint a like-minded attorney general, \u201cmaybe Aaron Siri,\u201d he said. Siri is a lawyer who has done millions of dollars of work for leading anti-vaccination groups, including a recent case that opened up religious exemptions for childhood vaccines in Mississippi. The crowd erupted in applause. He said he would use the power of that attorney general to threaten editors of medical journals and force them to publish studies that had been retracted (he often cites the retracted studies saying ivermectin, a parasite drug, is an effective treatment for Covid). \u201cWe\u2019re gonna say we\u2019re fixing to file some racketeering lawsuits if you don\u2019t start telling the truth in your journals.\u201d Before Kennedy\u2019s speech, an announcer told the crowd that as a nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense does not endorse political candidates. But evidence of Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine support is abundant. Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s employees have been selling merchandise at Kennedy campaign events, and its current president served as a strategist, fundraiser and organizer for Kennedy\u2019s campaign. The super PAC supporting Kennedy\u2019s candidacy is run by a former president of Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s New York chapter. Most Americans, particularly Democrats, do not share Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views on vaccines, but confidence in vaccines has fallen post-Covid. A small but growing number of Americans believe that vaccines are unsafe and can cause autism, which is false, according to a new survey from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Center. Children\u2019s Health Defense cheered the increasing distrust of vaccines during the pandemic, calling drops in childhood vaccination rates Covid\u2019s \u201csilver lining.\u201d The swell in attention on vaccines and Kennedy\u2019s enthusiastic activism against them served Children\u2019s Health Defense well. In 2021, the group raised nearly $16 million, more than 4 times its revenue in 2019. Kennedy\u2019s salary grew to more than $500,000. Kennedy\u2019s remarks closed out the first day of the conference. Earlier speakers included other heroes of the anti-vaccine movement: Paul Thomas, an Oregon pediatrician whose medical license was suspended and ultimately surrendered after he failed to adequately vaccinate his patients; James Lyons-Weiler, an activist who incorrectly claims a gene sequence in Covid proves the laboratory-origin hypothesis; and Andrew Wakefield, the physician stripped of his license over a retracted study that popularized the false belief that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines cause autism. \u201cI want to thank all of you for being on the front line in this battle,\u201d Kennedy said as he concluded, before pausing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can say anything that\u2019s campaign-related, but anyway you know what to do.\u201d After his remarks, attendees were invited to a cocktail reception and dinner with Children\u2019s Health Defense leaders, conference speakers and \u201cmedical freedom fighters.\u201d The event is to include a silent auction and a ceremony for the group\u2019s new \u201cDefender Award.\u201d The award\u2019s inaugural recipient, recognized for \u201chis courage and steadfast commitment to truth and liberty,\u201d is Robert F.

        "title": "A Florida couple has experienced a lot together \u2014 including back-to-back heart surgeries",
        "content": "Phil and Margaret Vaske have done most things together over their 63-year marriage. They didn't anticipate that open heart surgery would be one of them. Last month, Margaret, 82, developed back pain, and Phil, 86, started having chest pain. They went to the emergency room near their apartment in Sun City Center, Florida, to be examined. There, doctors determined that the Vaskes had recently had heart attacks around the same time. The couple was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit at HCA Florida Brandon Hospital. On Monday, they underwent back-to-back surgeries performed by the same doctor. Margaret had a quadruple bypass, Phil a triple bypass. The couple is now recovering in next-door rooms at the hospital. But their son, Jeff Vaske, said his dad has been sneaking into his mom's room to check on her. \u201cTurn your back and Dad\u2019s walked over from his neighboring room, standing there holding hands with Mom,\" he said. Margaret said Phil has always been one to take care of her. \u201cI had breast cancer twice. I had a hip replacement. He\u2019s been my rock whenever I had something wrong with me,\" she said. The Vaskes still aren't sure what to make of their mirroring health issues. Phil, the quieter of the pair, chalks it up to pure coincidence. But Margaret is convinced there\u2019s a lesson they\u2019re meant to learn. \"This is the Lord\u2019s way of telling us something,\" she said, clutching her rosary. She encouraged people to see their doctor or go to the hospital if they're having pain consistent with a heart attack. Chest pain is the most common symptom, but women in particular may experience shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain. Even before their marriage, the Vaskes were somewhat inseparable. As children, Margaret and Phil lived next door to each other on a farm in Bancroft, Iowa. Their fathers were best friends. In the late 1950s, after Phil returned from the Navy and Margaret graduated high school, they started going to dances together. \"We've been together ever since,\" Margaret said. At their wedding, Margaret learned that not every moment in life would be perfect: The day was scorching hot and the church had turned off its fans so she was sweating through her dress, she said, with only a thin handkerchief to dry off.

        "title": "Why do we faint? A newly discovered link between the heart and brain offers clues",
        "content": "A sudden restriction of blood flow to the brain. That's how scientists have traditionally explained why people faint. But several mysteries remain: What causes someone's blood flow to spontaneously change? And what parts of the brain play a key role? New research in mice, published this week in the journal Nature, offers a closer understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind fainting. The researchers theorize that the activation of neurons that link the heart and brain can induce a fainting spell. \"This is the first step to show there is much more to fainting than just reduced blood flow,\" said Vineet Augustine, an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the study's authors. \u201cThe blood flow reduction does play a role, but there are other brain circuits at play here,\" he added. \"It is not as simple as what cardiology textbooks would say.\" Specifically, the researchers found that neurons below the skull send signals from the heart to the brain that trigger a drop in heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate. That, in turn, may lead to the most common type of fainting \u2014 what scientists call \"reflex syncope\" \u2014 which can result from dehydration, the sight of blood or long periods of standing. \u201cOftentimes we\u2019re just scratching our heads as to what to do about it,\u201d said Dr. Zachary Goldberger, a cardiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health who wasn\u2019t part of the new research. \u201cNow that these scientists have helped us to understand that there\u2019s a possible mechanism for it, you could potentially imagine that there\u2019ll be therapies on the horizon,\" he said. The findings don\u2019t apply to fainting caused by underlying heart problems such as extremely slow or fast heart rhythms. Those instances are rarer and more deadly, Goldberger said. Going into the study, the researchers speculated that fainting was caused by activation of the vagus nerve \u2014 a superhighway of neurons, or nerve cells, that connects the brain to other organs. The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps the body rest and relax. Scientists suspect that when people faint, their parasympathetic response becomes exaggerated, so their heart rate, blood pressure and breathing slow down too much. To find out what role the vagus nerve might play in fainting, the researchers examined the internal organs of mice under a microscope. From there, they identified a specific stretch of neurons in the vagus nerve that travel from the lower chambers of the heart to the brainstem, or bottom part of the brain. \"Each neuron has two branches,\" Augustine said. \"One branch goes to the heart and the other branch goes to the brainstem. So it picks up signals from the heart and then it relays it onto the brainstem. It really forms a nice bridge.\u201d Next, the researchers tested whether stimulating these specific neurons in mice could induce fainting. \"We have this little fiber which we put into their brains, and we can shine just a little tiny bit of blue light to activate these neurons,\" said Jonathan Lovelace, a staff research associate in Augustine's lab and co-author of the study. Once the neurons are activated, \"these mice will maybe walk around for five seconds, and then spontaneously fall over and become still,\" Lovelace said. \"After a few more seconds, they\u2019ll get back up and start walking around.\u201d The mice exhibited other classic signs of fainting in humans: Their blood pressure, breathing and heart rates went down, their pupils dilated and their eyes rolled back into their heads. \"We were able to replicate this typical, iconic eye roll,\" Augustine said. \"That also very tightly correlated with the time when the fainting episode happened.\" The researchers also noticed that activating the neurons constricted blood vessels and reduced blood flow from the heart to the brain \u2014 two more characteristic signs of fainting. But Augustine said there's more to learn. His team still doesn't know what activates the nerve pathway in real life, or whether the findings neatly translate to humans. \"There would be much more nuance to human fainting,\" he said. Prior to the new research, scientists understood that people faint when there's not enough blood entering or exiting the heart, cutting off blood flow to the brain. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get blood to the rest of your body, including your brain, and you\u2019ll pass out,\u201d said Dr. Shamai Grossman, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Most of the time, fainting isn't worrisome unless someone passes out while driving or injures themselves during a fall, Grossman said. Roughly 40% of people have a fainting spell in their lifetime, often triggered by something minor. \"When you\u2019re standing for a long period of time or when you\u2019re thirsty, blood kind of pools in your legs, or in pregnant women when the fetus exerts pressure on your chest, it prevents blood from flowing back into the heart,\" Augustine said. \"Same thing when you have beginners playing musical instruments. They exert a lot of pressure on the chest and you tend to have fainting episodes.\" Other people faint from emotional responses to hearing bad news or even something funny \u2014 most likely because their body over-activates their parasympathetic nervous system to calm them down. While doctors currently don't have ways to prevent spontaneous fainting spells, Augustine said targeting the neurons identified in his study could be one approach. For instance, doctors could remove or replace certain genes involved in the vagus nerve pathway. \"In the future when things like gene therapy or targeted nerve stimulation become more pronounced in humans, you now have targets to potentially probe,\" he said.

        "title": "New lung cancer screening guidelines include heavy smokers who quit long ago",
        "content": "Only a fraction of people at high risk for lung cancer are getting screened for the disease even though it kills more in the United States than breast, colorectal and prostate cancers combined. New American Cancer Society guidelines will allow millions more to become eligible for regular scans that can detect tumors early enough to save lives. With one important exception, the new guidelines echo existing recommendations from the highly influential U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. In 2021, the panel said people ages 50 to 80 who had smoked at least 20 \u201cpack years\u201d and were either still smoking or had quit within the last 15 years should be tested annually with low-dose CT scan, a type of X-ray. According to the new guidance released Wednesday, even heavy smokers who quit 15 years ago or more should get the yearly scans. Experts say the previous guidance was based on a flawed premise: the longer it had been since a person had given up smoking, the lower the risk for cancer. A careful look at the data on who was diagnosed with lung cancer revealed that the risk of cancer rose as people aged, even among those who had given up smoking 15 or more years, said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society and one of the authors of the guidelines. While the lungs of ex-smokers might have become a little better initially, that effect wasn\u2019t lasting, he said.  \u201cPeople developed a false sense of security,\u201d which may have contributed to the \u201cabysmally low\u201d rates of screening, Dahut said.  A 2022 report from the American Lung Association indicated that only 5.8% of Americans had been screened for lung cancer and that in some states, rates were as low as 1%.  \u201cCompare this with mammography, which about two-thirds of women get when they hit a certain age,\u201d he said. Under previous guidelines, 14.3 million people in the U.S. would be eligible for screening. The new recommendation will include an additional 5 million people, Dahut said. The prognosis for people whose cancers are caught late is grim. The overall five-year survival rate for lung cancers diagnosed between 2012 and 2018 was 23%, the guideline authors note.  More than 80% of people whose lung cancer was caught early through screening were still alive after 20 years, according to research from  the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, presented at the Radiological Society of North America meeting last year. According to the cancer society's estimates, there will be 238,340 new cases of lung cancer and 127,070 deaths from the disease this year. Lung cancer is so deadly because most people aren't diagnosed until a very late stage. Many smokers and former smokers don\u2019t realize that a simple low-dose CT scan can catch lung cancers early enough to save their lives. Even among primary care physicians, who would be the ones to order up the tests, \u201cthere\u2019s confusion,\u201d Dahut said.   In general, Medicare and commercial insurance companies pay for tests that the task force recommends. However, it may take some time for insurance to cover the additional people included in the new guidelines, Dahut suggested. Dr. Chi-Fu Jeffrey Yang, a thoracic surgeon at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, has done informal surveys to get a better idea of why people might not be getting screened.  \u201cWe asked people if they had heard about it. Nobody had,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody had heard about mammograms for breast cancer, colonoscopies for colorectal cancer, and Pap smears for cervical cancer.\u201d The current low rates of screening are \u201ca national tragedy,\u201d said Dr. David Yankelevitz, director of the lung biopsy service at the Icahn School of Medicine. \u201cThis should be our greatest weapon against cancer by far. That such a small percentage are being screened is pretty frightening and a major failure\u201d He would like to see screening criteria broadened even further, especially for women, Black people and Native Americans. Research has shown these groups are more vulnerable to developing lung cancer either at lower exposures or younger. \u201cThey have a higher risk at lower ages and lower pack years,\u201d Yankelevitz said. The change in screening guidelines to include people who quit long ago is \u201chuge,\u201d said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, director of the Tobacco Treatment and Cancer Screening Clinic at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. \u201cPeople in their 40s and 50s who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day when they were in their teens and young adulthood often don\u2019t think of themselves as smokers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they need to get scanned.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "FDA proposes ban on food additive used in fruity sports drinks and sodas",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday proposed banning the use of brominated vegetable oil, a food ingredient once widely used in popular drinks like Gatorade and Mountain Dew that has been slowly phased out due to its link to potential health risks, including damage to the liver, heart and brain.  Brominated vegetable oil is a food additive primarily used in fruit-flavored sports drinks and sodas to keep ingredients from separating. It contains bromine, an element found in flame retardants. Although many large beverage brands, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi, have already stopped using the ingredient in their products, it can still be found in smaller grocery store brands and some popular regional beverages, like Sun Drop citrus-flavored soda.  The European Union and Japan ban the use of the ingredient in food and drinks. Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that banned four food additives, including brominated vegetable oil, becoming the first state to outlaw chemicals that are still allowed by the FDA. On Thursday, the FDA said it concluded that brominated vegetable oil was no longer safe to use after studies in rodents found that the ingredient is toxic to the thyroid, a gland that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure, heart rate and metabolism. Previous studies have also shown that it could potentially be harmful to the liver, heart and cause neurological problems. \u201cBased on these data and remaining unresolved safety questions, the FDA can no longer conclude that the use of BVO in food is safe,\u201d the agency said in a release. In 1970, the FDA took the ingredient off the list of substances \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe and Effective\" due to concerns it could cause harm to the body, although the agency has continued to say that the ingredient can be used in products on an \u201cinterim\" basis. The FDA said it will accept public comments on the proposed rule until Jan. 17. If the ban is approved, the agency said it will give the beverage makers at least one year to reformulate or relabel their products before enforcing the new rule. The FDA said it is also reassessing the potential cancer risk of red dye No. 3, a synthetic food coloring that was also included California's food additives ban.

        "title": "New antibiotic shows promise for drug-resistant gonorrhea",
        "content": "A new antibiotic has proven as effective as the last remaining recommended treatment for gonorrhea, helping to assuage mounting fears among public health experts about the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the sexually transmitted infection. Gonorrhea is the second most common STI in the U.S. and has developed resistance to all antibiotics used to treat it, except for the recommended combined therapy of an injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone with one dose of azithromycin pills. In recent years, ominous reports have suggested that this antibiotic arsenal might not maintain its robust effectiveness against the fast-evolving pathogen for much longer. On Wednesday, results from a late-stage clinical trial of a new antibiotic called zoliflodacin showed the drug cured so-called uncomplicated gonorrhea infections as effectively as ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The drug was developed by the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership, a Swiss nonprofit, and the U.S.-based Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics.   \u201cZoliflodacin gives us a new tool in the treatment of gonorrhea, and if used wisely, a barrier against the further spread of resistant infections,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, who was not involved in the trial. The antibiotic, which would be the first new gonorrhea treatment approved in decades, could make it to market by 2025. The World Health Organization estimates that globally there are more than 82 million new gonorrhea cases every year. In the U.S., in the wake of decades of cuts to state and local public health departments, STIs have soared to record heights. In 2021, there were 710,151 diagnosed cases of gonorrhea, a 28% increase since 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gonorrhea spreads through sexual contact and can separately infect the genitals, rectum and throat. The STI is especially common among adolescents and young adults and occurs disproportionately among gay and bisexual men, the CDC reports. Left untreated, gonorrhea poses a risk of infertility and can prove especially damaging to women, leading to pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. The infection can also raise the risk of HIV transmission. In recent years, global health authorities have issued increasingly urgent warnings that gonorrhea has been acquiring resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, with cases of highly drug-resistant gonorrhea reported in multiple nations. In January, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported the first two U.S. cases of gonorrhea that had resistance or reduced response to five classes of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone did cure those cases, but public health officials said they served as a harbinger for the emergence of strains that could evade the antibiotic. Without a new antibiotic weapon, curing highly drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea could require intensive treatment with multiple antibiotics, according to Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This so-called kitchen-sink approach, she said, would strain medical resources and raise the risk of driving the emergence of further microbial drug resistance to those other antibiotics. The ultimate fear is that eventually, gonorrhea could prove wholly untreatable, in at least some people. According to an Innoviva representative, the company aims to file for approval of the antibiotic with the Food and Drug Administration \u201cas quickly as practicably possible.\u201d Innoviva expects an expedited review, meaning the FDA would take about six months to issue a decision. Zoliflodacin belongs to a new class of antibiotics, and attacks gonorrhea in a novel way. In previous laboratory studies, zoliflodacin proved effective at neutralizing gonorrhea strains that were highly resistant to ceftriaxone and azithromycin and strains that had resistance to other antibiotics as well. A downside of zoliflodacin is that a previous, phase two clinical trial published in 2018 found that it was not as efficacious at treating gonorrhea infections in the throat as in the genital or rectal areas. However, Marrazzo, who was a co-author on that study, said that this disparity is common among gonorrhea treatments. \u201cGonorrhea in the throat is probably going to be a major Achilles heel in our battle to control gonorrhea going forward,\u201d Marrazzo said. But according to Dr. Margaret Koziel, chief medical officer of Innoviva, the new zoliflodacin trial showed \u201cencouraging\u201d results in the small number of participants with rectal or throat infections. The company \u201cwill certainly engage the FDA about whether the label indication might be for urogenital disease or for all uncomplicated gonorrhea,\u201d Koziel said. According to Dr. Manica Balasegaram, executive director of Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership \u2014 Innoviva\u2019s partner in the trial \u2014 zoliflodacin holds promise in retaining potency against gonorrhea for a longer period than previous treatments for the infection, because it was developed solely as a treatment for that STI. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are each used to combat numerous other infections; and the more they are used, the more opportunity gonorrhea has to develop resistance to them. \u201cThis new drug is also given orally instead of an intramuscular injection with ceftriaxone; this is an advantage,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, who studies STI prevention at the University of Paris and was not involved in the clinical trial. Molina is the head of one of the multiple clinical trials currently running of a meningitis B vaccine as prevention for gonorrhea. He said he expects to present final results of his trial at a scientific meeting in 2024. The new zoliflodacin study enrolled 930 men, women and adolescents, including people with HIV, with uncomplicated gonorrhea at 16 trial sites in five nations, including Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and the U.S. Participants were randomized to receive a single oral dose of zoliflodacin or a ceftriaxone injection plus oral azithromycin. The WHO has called the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity and has identified gonorrhea in particular as a priority pathogen. The zoliflodacin trial is the first to address such a priority pathogen that was marshalled by a nonprofit organization. Established in 2016 by the WHO to help shepherd new antibiotics to market, efforts by the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership\u2019 represent a promising new front in the vital effort to spur research and development of new antibiotics. Offering only thin profit margins, antibiotics do not tend to attract investment by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cTreating gonorrhea, it\u2019s not going to be your next Ozempic,\u201d said Marrazzo.

        "title": "Vaping among high school students dropped this year, report finds",
        "content": "Fewer high school students are vaping this year, the government reported Thursday. In a survey, 10% of high school students said they had used electronic cigarettes in the previous month, down from 14% last year. Use of any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes and cigars \u2014 also fell among high schoolers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. \u201cA lot of good news, I\u2019d say,\u201d said Kenneth Michael Cummings, a University of South Carolina researcher who was not involved in the CDC study. Among middle school student, about 5% said they used e-cigarettes. That did not significantly change from last year\u2019s survey. This year\u2019s survey involved more than 22,000 students who filled out an online questionnaire last spring. The agency considers the annual survey to be its best measure of youth smoking trends. Health officials believe a number of factors could be helping, including efforts to raise prices and limit sales to kids by raising the legal age to 21. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see this substantial decrease in e-cigarette use among high schoolers within the past year, which is a win for public health,\u201d said Brian King, the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco center director. The FDA has authorized a few tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes intended to help adult smokers cut back but has struggled to stop sales of illegal products. Other key findings in the report: In 2020, FDA regulators banned those teen-preferred flavors from reusable e-cigarettes like Juul and Vuse, which are now only sold in menthol and tobacco. But the flavor restriction didn\u2019t apply to disposable products, and companies like Elf Bar and Esco Bar quickly stepped in to fill the gap. The growing variety in flavors like gummy bear and watermelon has been almost entirely driven by cheap, disposable devices imported from China, which the FDA considers illegal. Those products now account for more than half of U.S. vaping sales, according to government figures. In the latest survey, about 56% of teens who vape said they used Elf Bar, trailed by Esco Bar and Vuse, which is a reusable e-cigarette made by R.J. Reynolds. Juul, the brand widely blamed for sparking the recent spike in teen vaping, was the fourth most popular brand, used by 16% of teens. The FDA tried to block imports of both Elf Bar and Esco Bar in May, but the products remain widely available. Elf Bar has thwarted customs officials by changing its brand name, among other steps designed to avoid detection. On Thursday, the FDA announced another round of fines against 20 stores selling Elf Bar products. The agency has sent more than 500 warning letters to retailers and manufacturers of unauthorized e-cigarettes over the past year, but those citations are not legally binding and are sometimes ignored. In the latest report, the CDC highlighted one worrisome but puzzling finding. There was a slight increase in middle schools students who said they had used at least one tobacco product in the past month, while that rate fell among high school students. Usually those move in tandem, said Kurt Ribisl, a University of North Carolina researcher. He and Cummings cautioned against making too much of the finding, saying it might be a one-year blip. ",

        "title": "What to know about eyedrops safety after recall and FDA warnings",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration recently cautioned consumers against using 27 different kinds of eyedrops \u2014 its third eyedrop-related warning this year \u2014 leading Americans to question whether any drops are safe to use. On Wednesday, the FDA said that pharmaceutical company Cardinal Health was recalling eyedrops sold under the Rugby brand after it received three reports of blurry vision, vision loss and burning eyes. Overall, however, experts say that artificial tears are not dangerous provided that consumers are aware of what they're putting in their eyes, and take certain precautions while doing it. \"Any lubricating drop that has not been recalled and is still available on pharmacy shelves should be perfectly safe,\" Dr. Christopher Starr, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, wrote in an email. Autumn, with its emergence of cold, dry air and proliferation of ragweed and other allergens, is peak eyedrop season, experts say. At least 117 million Americans used eyedrop products in 2020, according to Statista, a data research company. The group expects that number will rise to more than 123 million in 2024. In 2023, however, the FDA came out with several dire warnings about contamination of these commonly used products. Experts and health officials are concerned about the risks from using the drops. \"We urge consumers to stop using these products, as it could result in an eye infection,\" the FDA said in an emailed statement. It is unclear what prompted the agency to look closely at this particular facility, which has not been named. When bacteria enter our bodies through cuts in the skin or through food we eat, our immune systems are trained to kick in. White blood cells surge to form scabs. Stomach acids attack. But eyes are particularly vulnerable to foreign invaders. They \"don't have that level of protection,\" said Dr. Morgan Morelli, assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \"You're putting the product straight onto the eye.\" An outer layer of the eye, called the corneal dome, does not have blood vessels that are usually critical in the immune system process because the eye \"has to maintain a crystal clarity,\" said Dr. Ronald Benner, president of the American Optometric Association. When allergens prompt people to rub and itch their eyes, it can cause tiny scratches on the surface of the eye, opening the door wide for bacterial infections. \"When you have an infection in that tissue, the body can't fight it as quickly,\" Benner said. \"Putting a drop in that's contaminated makes things worse.\" Given the recalls, experts say the first thing consumers should do is check their medicine cabinets, purses, desk drawers, junk drawers and any other places eyedrops may be kept. This is a list of the latest drops the FDA says to stop using. Experts also recommend using only brand name eyedrops and other artificial tear products. \"There are some generics out there that are probably fine and safe, but you never know where they are manufactured,\" Benner said. \"You never know how long they've been on the shelf.\" Morelli agreed, even though brands tend to be more expensive than generics. She said she paused recently when faced with spending $30 on eyedrops for herself. \"When it comes to the eyes, you're probably safer spending more money and going with a brand name,\" Morelli said. Starr, also an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, reminds all patients to check the expiration dates on eyedrop bottles. \"If expired, please discard them, as there is a higher risk of contamination even with nonrecalled, well-manufactured eyedrops,\" he said.

        "title": "One H.S. in Virginia had 8 opioid overdoses in 3 weeks in unprecedented outbreak",
        "content": "Authorities are investigating an unprecedented outbreak of opioid overdoses at a single high school in Sterling, Virginia. Eight students at Park View High School have overdosed in the last three weeks, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office. In total, the sheriff\u2019s office is investigating nine opioid overdoses at Park View this year among male and female students. None of the overdoses were fatal, but each required some sort of medical intervention such as treatment, CPR or transport to a hospital. The most recent case happened off-campus on Tuesday evening. \"This sadly, horrifically happened last night,\" said Thomas Julia, the communications director for the sheriff's office, who added that the student had to be given CPR. The county has never had so many opioid overdoses in such a short period of time, Julia said. Before the outbreak at Park View, the sheriff\u2019s office had investigated nine opioid overdoses among young people in Loudoun County this year, bringing the annual total to 18 so far. In 2022, there were 19 such reports. Julia said all nine cases at Park View are believed to involve fentanyl, since the students took round blue pills marked \"M30\" \u2014 one of the most common appearances of fentanyl that mimics oxycodone sold at pharmacies. Nevertheless, the sheriff\u2019s office is sending the pills to laboratories to confirm that fentanyl was present, Julia said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the source of these drugs,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to protect the kids that are in the school. We want to make sure they are more aware of the dangers of fentanyl, which can be lethal in a single dose.\u201d Four of the overdoses occurred on campus and three required CPR. At least three cases also required the administration of naloxone, a life-saving medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to quickly reverse opioid overdoses. Julia said at least one person at every school in Loudoun County is trained to administer the medication. In a statement Tuesday, the superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools, Aaron Spence, said he was \"concerned and saddened\" by the crisis, adding that \"the issue of addiction is truly at play here.\" Spence said the school system held community information sessions about fentanyl last spring and is now training and supplying its high school staff with naloxone. Park View families received a message this week with information and resources, he added. But Julia said the sheriff's office felt the need to draw more attention to the issue by issuing a press release on Tuesday. \"Normally we allow the schools to take the lead in this, but in all honesty, we felt that there was not enough public information being put out there of what was actually happening,\" he said. Loudoun County Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment. Dr. J. Deanna Wilson, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who studies opioid use disorder treatment, said the surge of overdoses at Park View is reflective of a national trend. \"More and more young people are experiencing a mental health and substance use crisis,\" she said. \"Drug overdoses are now the third leading cause of death for young people. It's only a matter of time before you see that translated in the schools where young people spend the bulk of their time.\" Nationally, the median monthly overdose deaths among adolescents ages 10 to 19 doubled from the second half of 2019 to the second half of 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And median monthly deaths involving illegally made fentanyl nearly tripled. Most of those adolescents did not have a history of opioid use, meaning addiction wasn't the culprit, Wilson said. \u201cYoung people are getting access to things that they think are pills like prescription opioids or benzodiazepines,\" she said. \"What they\u2019re actually getting is counterfeit pills that are made up of fentanyl.\u201d Rather than telling young people to abstain from drugs, schools and parents should normalize having naloxone on hand, Wilson said. Thirty-six states allow K-12 schools to administer opioid antagonists, the class of medications that includes naloxone, according to a recent analysis. But just nine states expressly require schools to have opioid antagonists, and some of those requirements only apply to public schools or certain grades. In a letter to educators on Monday, the Biden administration said every school should have naloxone to prevent overdose deaths. Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Man who received the second pig heart transplant dies, hospital says",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The second person to receive a transplanted heart from a pig has died, nearly six weeks after the highly experimental surgery, his Maryland doctors announced Tuesday. Lawrence Faucette, 58, was dying from heart failure and ineligible for a traditional heart transplant when he received the genetically modified pig heart on Sept. 20. According to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the heart had seemed healthy for the first month but began showing signs of rejection in recent days. Faucette died Monday. In a statement released by the hospital, Faucette\u2019s wife, Ann, said her husband \u201cknew his time with us was short and this was his last chance to do for others. He never imagined he would survive as long as he did.\u201d The Maryland team last year performed the world\u2019s first transplant of a heart from a genetically altered pig into another dying man. David Bennett survived two months before that heart failed, for reasons that aren\u2019t completely clear although signs of a pig virus later were found inside the organ. Lessons from that first experiment led to changes, including better virus testing, before the second attempt. \u201cMr. Faucette\u2019s last wish was for us to make the most of what we have learned from our experience,\u201d Dr. Bartley Griffith, the surgeon who led the transplant at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said in a statement. Attempts at animal-to-human organ transplants \u2014 called xenotransplants \u2014 have failed for decades, as people\u2019s immune systems immediately destroyed the foreign tissue. Now scientists are trying again using pigs genetically modified to make their organs more humanlike. Faucette, a Navy veteran and father of two from Frederick, Maryland, had been turned down for a traditional heart transplant because of other health problems when he came to the Maryland hospital, out of options and expressing a wish to spend a little more time with his family. In mid-October, the hospital said Faucette had been able to stand and released video showing him working hard in physical therapy to regain the strength needed to attempt walking. Cardiac xenotransplant chief Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin said the team will analyze what happened with the heart as they continue studying pig organs. Many scientists hope xenotransplants one day could compensate for the huge shortage of human organ donations. More than 100,000 people are on the nation\u2019s list for a transplant, most awaiting kidneys, and thousands will die waiting. A handful of scientific teams have tested pig kidneys and hearts in monkeys and in donated human bodies, hoping to learn enough for the Food and Drug Administration to allow formal xenotransplant studies.

        "title": "Infant mortality rose in 2022 for the first time in two decades",
        "content": "The U.S. infant mortality rate rose last year for the first time in two decades. The rate refers to the number of infants who died before their first birthdays out of every 1,000 live births. The U.S. recorded 5.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022, a 3% increase over the previous year, according to a report Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last year-to-year increase was from 2001 to 2002, when the rate similarly rose by 3%. The 2022 data are estimates based on birth and death records submitted to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC will most likely release a final report next year following a more comprehensive review of the data. According to Danielle Ely, a co-author of the report and a health statistician at the health statistics center, \u201cthere were a number of states that had increases in the number of infant deaths and in their rates from 2021 to 2022.\" But the rise in infant mortality rates was most pronounced in four states, she said: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Texas. Reproductive health experts who weren't involved in the CDC report have a few theories about why the trend reversed course last year. According to Dr. Pat Gabbe, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, some pregnant people may not have received proper medical care during the Covid pandemic because they were seeing doctors virtually or hesitated to visit hospitals for pregnancy complications. \"Every time we\u2019ve measured infant mortality, it has trended down, and what\u2019s changed? Covid. It\u2019s disrupted all the community support we developed that helped women access prenatal care,\" Gabbe said. The pandemic also led to job loss and economic instability, which can increase stress levels among pregnant people, said Martine Hackett, an associate professor of health professions at Hofstra University. \"One of the leading factors that contribute to babies born too small and babies born too early is stress,\" Hackett said. But Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said the increase in infant mortality is a byproduct of ending the constitutional right to abortion. Georgia, Missouri and Texas all instated new abortion bans around the time Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. \u201cI look at this data and it breaks my heart as a pediatrician, of course. But I also could tell you that anybody who\u2019s in the reproductive health space could and did warn that this is the type of data we were going to start seeing when we took away the federal protections to abortion access,\u201d Wilkinson said. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant deaths, followed by preterm births (before 37 weeks\u2019 gestation) and low birth weight. But those rates didn\u2019t change much in 2022, according to the CDC report. Instead, the report found an increase in infants who died from pregnancy complications, such as the cervix\u2019s opening too early or the amniotic sac\u2019s rupturing before labor begins. Such complications can lead to premature birth, miscarriage or infection. The report also detected an increase in the number of infants who died from bacterial sepsis \u2014 a life-threatening response to infection \u2014 in 2022. Hackett said the fatal health outcomes could be triggered by stress during pregnancy, while Wilkinson said they\u2019re likely to be driven by limited access to specialists who can treat complicated pregnancies. Around 2.2 million women of childbearing age and nearly 150,000 babies live in counties where there are no hospitals or birth centers that offer obstetric care or have obstetric providers, according to a report last year from March of Dimes, a nonprofit group that researches premature birth. \u201cWhile some of those places could probably deliver a straightforward, non-complicated pregnancy, the minute it becomes complicated, you are not going to have the expertise within that building to care for either the pregnant person or the infant,\u201d Wilkinson said. Specialists are becoming even less available now that abortion bans limit certain types of reproductive care, she added. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see graduating medical students choose not to go into OBGYN, and then we\u2019re starting to see OBGYN residents choose not to train in states where it is hard for them to get comprehensive training,\u201d Wilkinson said. Overall, the U.S. infant mortality rate has been declining for at least a century, but racial disparities persist: Black infants still die at more than twice the rate of white infants, and they are nearly four times more likely to die from complications related to low birth weight. In 2022, infants born to Black women had a mortality rate of 10.9 per 1,000 live births, though the rate didn\u2019t increase measurably compared to 2021. Infants born to white women, on the other hand, had a mortality rate of 4.5 per 1,000 live births \u2014 a nearly 4% increase. Infant mortality rates also rose last year for male infants, infants born to women ages 25 to 29 and preterm infants, according to the CDC report. Reproductive health experts said male babies have historically been more vulnerable to early death than female babies, perhaps because they are biologically more susceptible to diseases or more likely to be born prematurely. But the rise among white babies and babies born to women in their late 20s is unusual, they said, and it may be driven by the same factors that influenced the national trend. Experts predicted that infant mortality would also rise this year, because many people still have limited access to prenatal care. The 12-month period ending in March of this year had a higher infant mortality rate than the 12-month period ending in March 2022, according to CDC data. \"We have to be committed to turning this back,\" Gabbe said. \"There\u2019s no excuse.\u201d  Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "FDA moves closer to sickle cell cure that uses gene editing",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration may be one step closer to what could be the first approval of a drug that uses the groundbreaking gene-editing tool CRISPR.  The drug, called exa-cel, treats sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that affects an estimated 100,000 people in the U.S., most of whom are Black, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The illness causes the body\u2019s red blood cells, usually disk-shaped, to take on a crescent or sickle shape. When that occurs, the cells can clump together, leading to clots and blockages in the blood vessels. That may result in a variety of complications, including excruciating pain, trouble breathing or stroke.   \u201cThe promise of a universally available, potentially curative option for individuals with sickle cell disease is revolutionary,\u201d said Dr. Biree Andemariam, a hematologist and the director of the New England Sickle Cell Institute at the University of Connecticut. Andemariam has consulted for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which makes exa-cel.  The illness is chronic, and the only known cure is a bone marrow transplant from a donor, which carries the risk of rejection. The gene-editing drug, from Vertex along with CRISPR Therapeutics, would eliminate the need for a donor. Instead, it works by changing the DNA in the patient\u2019s blood cells. Exa-cel uses CRISPR, a gene-editing tool that\u2019s able to target certain stretches of DNA and snip them out, essentially deleting the unwanted section that, in the case of sickle cell disease, causes the cells to take on a crescent shape.  On Tuesday, an FDA advisory committee reviewed the drug at an all-day meeting. Such advisory meetings are usually one of the final steps before the agency decides whether to approve a drug. The FDA is expected to issue a final ruling by Dec. 8.  No drug that uses CRISPR gene-editing \u2014 which was invented in 2009 \u2014 has been granted FDA approval. What\u2019s more, Tuesday\u2019s meeting looked different from past advisory committee meetings. In this case, the panel was not asked to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Vertex\u2019s drug, which is seeking approval for people ages 12 and up with severe illness. Instead, the focus was on the \u201coff-target\u201d effects of CRISPR \u2014 that is, when the technology makes cuts to other stretches of the DNA other than the intended target \u2014 and how the FDA should think about those risks moving forward. It\u2019s unclear what effects an off-target edit would have on a patient \u2014 it depends entirely on where it happens in the DNA.  \u201cOff-target editing does not necessarily mean that there\u2019s going to be a bad outcome,\u201d said committee member Scot Wolfe, a professor of molecular, cell and cancer biology at UMass Chan Medical School. \u201cThere seems to be a lot of uncertainty, a lot of unknowns, about what these off-target changes might mean,\u201d said committee member Lisa Lee, an epidemiologist and the director of scholarly integrity and research compliance at Virginia Tech.  \u201cAre those unknowns more harmful than not allowing this to go forward?\u201d Lee asked.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals presented research findings on 46 people who received the treatment. Among the 30 patients with a minimum of 18 months of follow-up, 29 no longer experienced severe pain crises. The company said there was no evidence of \u201coff-target\u201d effects from the therapy, but committee members questioned whether Vertex\u2019s analysis was thorough enough. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning that this product is important for our patients,\u201d said a committee member, Dr. Joseph Wu, the director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. \u201cI\u2019m just saying we\u2019re at a point in which this thing is going to take off and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have more additional data.\u201d Vertex has not disclosed the price of gene therapy, but, if it is approved, it is expected to be extremely expensive, potentially costing as much as $2 million per patient, according to a report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit group that helps determine fair prices for drugs.  Dr. Stephan Grupp, the chief of the therapy and transplant section of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who consults for Vertex, said in an email that if it is approved, the step next would be to make sure patients can get access. \u201cI do think that there\u2019re going to have to be a lot of questions answered regarding access,\u201d Andemariam said. While exa-cel is technically a one-time treatment, the process involves a number of steps.  It starts by extracting stem cells from the patient\u2019s blood. The stem cells are edited with exa-cel in the lab to delete the snippet of DNA that causes the cells to warp. Before the cells can be reinfused back into the patient, however, the patient must undergo chemotherapy to kill off cells that produce the sickle-shaped cells.

        "title": "FDA takes first step to protect children from medications that look and taste like candy",
        "content": "Is that gummy a vitamin or candy? It can be hard to tell, especially for children. Since 2019, there\u2019s been a spike in the number of children younger than 4 who were taken to the emergency room for ingesting gummy multivitamins and over-the-counter sleep aids like melatonin. That\u2019s why the Food and Drug Administration convened a meeting of experts Monday to discuss what, exactly, makes a drug \u201ccandy-like.\u201d The experts, who included more than a dozen doctors, drugmakers and poison control center directors, noted that risks of candy-like drugs being accidentally ingested depended on taste, packaging and how the products were formulated, such as chewable gummies versus hard tablets that must be swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of situations where babysitters didn\u2019t know which are the gummies or which are the medications,\u201d Dr. Suzanne Doyon, medical director of the Connecticut Poison Control Center and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at UConn Health in Connecticut, said during the FDA meeting. Making over-the-counter medications more appealing to children is not inherently a bad thing. Many children\u2019s medications don\u2019t taste very good, so drugmakers have tweaked their products to improve the flavor so children will take them. Some of these products, however, may become so appealing that they run the risk of children eating them like they\u2019re candy, not drugs. \u201cChildren will get into anything, and children will especially get into anything that tastes or looks like candy,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Michele, who leads the FDA\u2019s office of nonprescription drugs. Rachel Meyers, pediatric pharmacist and professor at Rutgers University\u2019s Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy in New Jersey, warned about medications that taste so good that children end up eating too many. \u201cWe need to get rid of the idea that it needs to be absolutely delicious to take it,\u201d she said. Data presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the root cause of many accidental ingestions by children was the practice of adults to leave the medications outside of containers, with many children unaware if they were medications or sweet treats. Jeffrey Worthington, the president of Senopsys, a firm that works with drug companies to make their products easier to consume, recommended removing added colors and avoiding cartoon characters or iconic shapes. \u201cI think there are lots of things I can point to in a gummy that I would rather not see in a drug product,\u201d he said. \u201cThings like rings and worms, cartoon characters and a lot of the iconography that aligns with gummies and other dietary supplements.\u201d Others at the meeting recommended packaging and labels to include embossing or for pills to be individually wrapped to deter overdosing. The meeting didn\u2019t include a vote and the FDA didn't say whether there would be further discussions. Dr. Christopher Hoyte, medical director of the Rocky Mountain Poison & Drug Center, suggested a straightforward definition for candylike medications. Anything \u201creasonable that a person would look at it and have a sort of difficult time telling the difference between the two,\u201d he said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "'Deny, deny, deny': By rejecting claims, Medicare Advantage plans threaten rural hospitals and patients, CEOs say",
        "content": "For decades, Rose Stone counted on the Alliance HealthCare System in rural Holly Springs, Mississippi, for her medical needs. But after she retired and signed up for a Medicare Advantage plan, she was surprised to learn it didn\u2019t cover her visits to nonprofit Alliance, the only health-care provider within 25 miles. Stone had a choice: use her own money to keep seeing her regular doctor or drive out of town to see a physician she didn\u2019t know but whose costs were covered.  \u201cIt was a mess,\u201d Stone told NBC News. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the doctor because I was going to have to pay out-of-pocket money I didn\u2019t have.\u201d  Some 31 million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans, private-sector alternatives to Medicare introduced in 2003 by Congress to encourage greater efficiency in health care. Just over half of Americans on Medicare are enrolled in one of the plans offered by large insurance companies, including UnitedHealthcare and Humana. Problems are emerging with the plans, however. Last year, a federal audit from 2013 was released showing that 8 of the 10 largest plans had submitted inflated bills to Medicare. As for the quality of care, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a non-partisan agency of Congress, said in a March report that it could not conclude Medicare Advantage plans \u201csystematically provide better quality\u201d over regular Medicare. Even worse, because the plans routinely deny coverage for necessary care, they are threatening the existence of struggling rural hospitals nationwide, CEOs of facilities in six states told NBC News. While the number of older Americans who rely on Medicare Advantage in rural areas continues to rise, these denials force the hospitals to eat the increasing costs of care, causing some to close operations and leave residents without access to treatment. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to reimburse for anything \u2014 deny, deny, deny,\u201d Dr. Kenneth Williams, CEO of Alliance HealthCare, said of Medicare Advantage plans. \u201cThey are taking over Medicare and they are taking advantage of elderly patients.\u201d Williams is something of a local hero in Holly Springs. When the area hospital was in danger of closing in 1999, he marshaled resources and bought it to keep it open. Alliance serves a county with 38,000 people. Still, this spring he had to shut down a long-time geriatric psychiatry program that had served the community for over eight years. Coverage denials from Medicare Advantage plans killed the program, Williams said. Medicare Advantage plans are sold assiduously by celebrity pitchmen \u2014 one is Joe Namath \u2014 as a better way for Americans who qualify for Medicare to get insurance coverage. Many plans add services such as dental and hearing care and wellness programs not offered under traditional Medicare, for which beneficiaries pay extra. The U.S. government pays most of beneficiaries\u2019 premiums to the insurers offering the plans. If the government hoped Medicare Advantage plans would reduce the costs of care, that has not been the outcome. Medicare pays the plans 6 percent more than it would spend if plan enrollees were covered under regular, fee-for-service Medicare, the MedPAC report found. Medicare payments to the plans will total $27 billion more in 2023 than if patients were enrolled in traditional Medicare, the report projected. A new enrollment period for the plans began this month. State insurance commissioners told NBC News they, too, receive many complaints from customers saying they were sold Medicare Advantage plans without understanding their limitations. A major complaint, said Mike Chaney, the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner: \u201cConsumers are not aware their doctors are likely to change under the Medicare Advantage plans.\u201d Medicare Advantage plans have grown in popularity in recent years, with enrollment more than doubling nationwide since 2013. One explanation: The plans are often cheaper than paying for a Medicare supplement, sometimes referred to as Medigap. Another reason for the growth may be the significantly larger commissions the government pays to brokers selling Medicare Advantage plans. In 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid will pay brokers a commission of between $611 and $762 for the first year of a Medicare Advantage plan, depending on the state, and roughly half that on annual renewals. On Medicare supplements, by contrast, brokers receive around $300 on average in year one. Brokers selling the so-called advantage plans aren\u2019t the only ones making money on them. UnitedHealth Group, the largest Medicare Advantage provider with 7.6 million people in its plans, generated $257 billion in premium revenues in 2022, some 13% over the previous year. A significant driver of that growth was its Medicare Advantage plans, the company\u2019s financial filings said. Humana, the next largest provider, counts 5.3 million Medicare Advantage customers; during the six months that ended June 30, almost 80% of Humana\u2019s $51 billion in premium revenues came from individual Medicare Advantage plans, its filings show. Meanwhile, CEOs of rural nonprofit hospital systems in Arkansas, Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota and Texas told NBC News that Medicare Advantage plans repeatedly refuse to reimburse them for the care they provide. Some 170 rural hospitals are at risk of closing in those six states alone, according to a report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a nonprofit advocacy organization. While there are multiple reasons for rural hospitals\u2019 financial woes, coverage denials from Medicare Advantage plans play a big part, said Harold Miller, president of the Center that conducted the study. For years, Medicare Advantage plans had been rare in rural areas, now they are becoming ubiquitous. In 2022, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans grew 13 percent in rural areas versus 7 percent in urban zones, according to the MedPAC report. Mary Beth Donahue, president of the Better Medicare Alliance, an advocacy group that supports Medicare Advantage plans, said in a statement: \u201cWe acknowledge the challenges facing some health systems, but we need to ensure coverage is maintained for millions of seniors. As Medicare Advantage continues to grow, it is essential that hospitals provide access for seniors and people with disabilities who rely on this program.\u201d A UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cOver 6,000 hospitals participate in our UnitedHealthcare network, and we have built collaborative relationships with them to help ensure we are meeting our shared goal of providing quality care to the people we serve.\u201d By law, Medicare Advantage plans are supposed to base their reimbursements on Medicare rules. But there\u2019s room for interpretation, says the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, insurers can use their own clinical criteria to determine whether to authorize or pay for care. A report last year by the department\u2019s Inspector General found that in June 2019, the 15 top Medicare Advantage plans denied authorization for 13 percent of claims that had met Medicare rules. The plans also denied payment for 18 percent of claims that met Medicare coverage and billing rules, the report said. Even when the plans pay, they reimburse providers far less than traditional Medicare, rural hospital CEOs and doctors told NBC News. The plans are effectively rationing health care, these providers said. For example, the hospital officials cited specific cases in which plans take a week to approve care but agree to pay only for a three-night stay; deny coverage after approving it, clawing money back from hospitals; or contend a provider is \u201cout of network\u201d when it isn\u2019t. They also deny routine tests and refuse to pay for rehabilitation, saying patients should go home before their doctors think it\u2019s wise. \u201cAny study we order \u2014 X-ray, CT scan, MRI, stress tests \u2014 they\u2019re going to deny,\u201d said Craig Pendergrass, a doctor at Ozarks Community Hospital, a nonprofit critical access hospital in Gravette, Arkansas, in the northwest corner of the state. \u201cWith straight Medicare we just schedule it.\u201d He estimated that his staff spends one-quarter of each week trying to persuade the plans not to deny the tests or treatment. Large hospital systems with big staffs can dedicate time and energy to fighting claims denials, the American Hospital Association says. Small rural hospitals cannot. In response, some smaller systems are starting to reject Medicare Advantage plans. This summer, Jason Merkley, chief executive of Brookings Health System, a highly rated nonprofit hospital chain in South Dakota, stopped accepting the plans because of coverage denials and pre-authorization problems. Only a small percentage of the system\u2019s patients had Medicare Advantage plans, Merkley told NBC News, but the effort required to battle the denials was considerable. A Humana spokesman provided this statement: \u201cIn our Medicare Advantage hospital contracts, Humana pays rates, on average, that are above fee-for-service Medicare rates. Moreover, the fee-for-service Medicare reimbursement model is focused on patient volume and the quantity of services provided, whereas we are focused on delivering better outcomes for patients.\u201d In mid-September, Samaritan Health Services, a five-hospital system in Oregon, said it ended its contract with UnitedHealthcare, including its Medicare Advantage plans. \u201cUnited Healthcare\u2019s processing of requests and claims has made it difficult for Samaritan to provide timely access to the appropriate care to United\u2019s members,\u201d the system said. Refusing to accept Medicare Advantage plans is not an option for hospitals with many plan customers and whose facilities are the only ones in their rural areas, the CEOs say. If they stopped accepting the plans, their communities would have to forego local health care. \u201cWe\u2019re a system with a proud history of taking all patients, insured or not,\u201d said Paul Taylor, CEO of the 25-bed Ozarks Community Hospital. \u201cBut this makes it really difficult for us to continue to care for at-risk patients. We can\u2019t pay our bills.\u201d Medicare Advantage plans make up 40% of his reimbursements now, up from 20% a few years ago, he said. Taylor recently conducted a two-year study of what his hospital received treating traditional Medicare patients versus what it received from Medicare Advantage plans. He found that the plans paid $4.5 million less than he received under Medicare for the same treatments. That\u2019s roughly what his facility generates in revenues each month. Ozarks Community, which serves approximately 30,000 people, narrowly averted a bankruptcy filing this spring, Taylor said. He is selling assets to stay afloat. In late August, a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Covid arrived at San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center, a 49-bed, level 3 trauma center in Alamosa, Colorado. The nonprofit hospital serves a six-county region in south central Colorado that\u2019s home to about 50,000 people. Roughly the size of Delaware, the area is one of the poorer in the state, said Konnie Martin, San Luis Valley Health\u2019s chief executive. The doctor handling the patient recommended admitting her to the hospital, but her UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan balked. They agreed to pay only for \u201cobservation\u201d of the patient, a lower standard of care that generates much smaller reimbursements. The facility went ahead and treated her as an inpatient for two weeks, a stay that cost $29,458, all of which San Luis Valley Health absorbed, it said. Had the Medicare Advantage plan agreed to cover the claim, it would have paid one-third, the hospital estimated. \u201cThis is the norm \u2014 they push back on people to try to keep them out of the hospital or delay their hospital care,\u201d Martin said. The hospital\u2019s staff has to spend time resubmitting claims, she added, saying: \u201cIt costs us 2 or 3 times the amount of labor and investment to collect on one claim.\u201d Her staff provided documentation of four recent denials of coverage by United Healthcare in one week. The coverage denials the CEOs described to NBC News are similar to those found in last year\u2019s Health and Human Services report. They included erroneous rejections of MRIs and CT scans, paying only for \u201cobservation\u201d rather than inpatient care, denials of long-term acute care, rehab, lab tests and medical equipment. The Inspector General said that \u201chuman error\u201d and \u201csystem processing error\u201d caused most of the denials by Medicare Advantage plans. But the hospital executives NBC News spoke with say they believe the denials are a strategy by insurers to improve their profits by refusing to pay claims. \u201cThis world of medical billing is so automated if you\u2019re denying a claim, you\u2019re doing it intentionally,\u201d said Martin, of San Luis Valley Health. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.  The Cuero Regional Health System, a small hospital in Cuero, Texas, serves a population of 22,000. Its officials say Medicare Advantage plans often deny care based on the insurers\u2019 internal determinations about the type of care required, overruling the physicians handling the cases. When the hospital questions a determination \u2014 called a peer-to-peer review \u2014 officials often have to argue with a physician who doesn\u2019t specialize in the care the patient requires, said Lynn Falcone, its chief executive. A Medicare Advantage plan recently denied a referral to long-term acute care for a patient with sepsis, Falcone said. When the family practice doctor overseeing the case asked for a peer-to-peer review, the insurance company physician defending the denial was an ob-gyn specialist. \u201cA surgeon that delivers babies maybe isn\u2019t used to handling sepsis,\u201d Falcone said.  Sandra Tate of Cuero, Texas, said her family\u2019s Medicare Advantage plan created problems for her family in Feb. 2022. Her husband required physical and respiratory therapy after a 10-day stay in the ICU at Cuero Regional Health, she said; although a previous plan from Humana had paid for this treatment four years earlier, the second request for reimbursement was denied under her new plan from United Healthcare. After arguing with the insurer for 30 minutes, Tate, a former school nurse, said she was never told why. \u201cI pay my Medicare premiums and also my insurance premiums,\u201d Tate told NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Medicare Advantage is not wanting to pay the rural hospitals that are taking care of you.\u201d The UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman said the company could not comment on Tate\u2019s experience unless she signed a waiver; Tate declined to do so. In its financial filings, United Healthcare describes how rates paid by the government on Medicare Advantage plans can fall below what the insurer calls its \u201ccost trends.\u201d To combat these profit pressures, the insurer said, it \u201ccan seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management\u201d and \u201cadjust member benefits.\u201d For eight-and-a-half years, Alliance HealthCare System's inpatient geriatric psychiatry program helped older patients in Holly Springs, Mississippi, with depression and other mental health issues. The 15-bed facility offered group and family therapy as well as an inpatient program that could run from one to three weeks, said Ejerra J. Selma Dukes, its former director.  Medicare always paid for the services, Dukes said. But a few years ago, she started seeing more patients with Medicare Advantage plans declining to pay. The insurers would reject claims for patients with depression and dementia, she said, agreeing to reimburse only for those who were suicidal, paranoid or homicidal. \u201cIt had to be extreme for them to say we will allow you all to bring them in,\u201d Dukes told NBC News. On March 28, the program closed its doors, Dukes said, a result of the denials. \u201cIt was heartbreaking, especially with those who had been dealing with us a long time,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou know you can help, but you can\u2019t bring people in for free.\u201d Meanwhile, Rose Stone is once again receiving care at Alliance HealthCare System. She junked her Medicare Advantage Plan and returned to Medicare, with a supplement. \u201cEverything is fine now,\u201d she said.

        "title": "FDA warns against buying, using eyedrops made in 'insanitary conditions'",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration on Monday expanded its warning not to buy or use eyedrops sold by several major retailers, sometimes under their own brand names. The warning now includes the product Equate Hydration PF Lubricant Eye Drop 10 mL sold by Walmart, the FDA said. \"Walmart is removing the product from their store shelves and website,\" it said in an updated drug safety warning. A list of eyedrops published under the FDA's warning also includes those sold under the brands CVS Health, Leader, Rugby, Rite Aid, Target Up & Up and Velocity Pharma. The agency said retailers should pull them from shelves and consumers should discard them. Besides Walmart's noted cooperation, the FDA said CVS, Target and Rite Aid were pulling the eyedrops from shelves and making them unavailable on their websites. The FDA said infection and vision loss were possible, although it has not received reports of either. It sounded alarms after inspectors found contamination in the production area. \"FDA recommended the manufacturer of these products recall all lots on October 25, 2023, after agency investigators found insanitary conditions in the manufacturing facility and positive bacterial test results from environmental sampling of critical drug production areas in the facility,\" it said in its warning. The agency did not name the manufacturer or the location of the facility. It said it recommended last week that the maker recall the products, but it's not clear whether it responded or complied. Retailer CVS and pharmaceutical company Cardinal Health, the concern behind the eyedrops sold under the Leader and Rugby brands, both said separately that Velocity Pharma LLC was the supplier. Velocity Pharma is based in Farmingdale, New York. It did not respond to multiple inquiries, including a question about where its eyedrops are made. The FDA did not respond to an inquiry about the location of the facility it said was the site of unsanitary conditions. CVS said in a statement it stopped selling the eyedrops as soon as it received the FDA warning. \"Customers who purchased these products can return them to CVS Pharmacy for a full refund,\" it said. Cardinal Health said, \"We are in the process of working with Velocity Pharma and FDA to initiate a recall of all impacted Rugby Laboratories and Cardinal Health Leader branded eye drop products.\" Walmart and Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this year that 81 people in 18 states tested positive for the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to most antibiotics. Officials from the CDC and the FDA said most of the cases could be tied to eyedrops made in India and sold under the brands EzriCare Artificial Tears, Delsam Pharma Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma Artificial Eye Ointment, all since recalled. Fourteen of the 81 people were blinded; an additional four needed at least one eye removed, officials said. Four people ultimately died, they said. The bacterium found at the facility behind the latest warning was not identified. Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.  ",

        "title": "Shortage of drug that treats thinning hair is a 'significant problem,' doctors say",
        "content": "A popular drug used to regrow hair and thicken thinning locks in both men and women may be difficult to find in some pharmacies, according to new research. The pill, called minoxidil, must be taken every day for patients to maintain the progress they've made in restoring hair growth. An interruption could be devastating. \"You can go backwards and start losing your hair again,\" said Dr. Adam Friedman, professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University. Minoxidil is often used for androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern hair loss. It's a condition that affects nearly half of men and about a quarter of women by age 50, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology.  In recent months, Friedman noticed that his patients were having difficulty obtaining 30-day supplies of the drug from their Washington, D.C.-area pharmacies. Earlier this month, he and colleagues called 277 pharmacies in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia to ask about their minoxidil supplies. They found considerable shortages. Just 40% of those pharmacies had the ability to immediately fill 30-day prescriptions for minoxidil in doses used to treat hair loss (2.5 milligrams). The research has been published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. Friedman could not identify a reason for the shortage, but said that the drug had been gaining attention through both mainstream and social media \u2014 which could have triggered a rise in prescriptions. It is unclear how long patients would have to wait for their medication based on the survey. The researchers did not ask how quickly those pharmacies could restock their minoxidil supply. Still, Friedman said he is concerned about the lapse. \"A substantial number of our patients are not going to be able to access minoxidil because of these shortages,\" Friedman said. \"It's a significant problem.\" Minoxidil has been around for decades as a drug to treat high blood pressure by dilating blood vessels. When researchers were first testing the drug in the 1960s, patients reported an interesting side effect: excessive hair growth. While no one knows for sure how minoxidil stimulates hair to grow, doctors believe the drug increases blood flow around hair follicles. By the late 1980s, it was incorporated into topical hair loss treatments, such as Rogaine. Over time, it became clear that applying the treatment to the scalp daily wasn't just cumbersome; doctors found that it didn't work as well as taking it orally. Taken by mouth, however, minoxidil can stimulate hair growth anywhere on the body, including the chin and arms. That may not be desirable for many patients, especially women. Still, Dr. Loren Krueger, an assistant professor in the dermatology department at Emory University School of Medicine, calls oral minoxidil a \"game changer\" in terms of hair loss, treatment and restoration. \"The medication is really low-risk, high-reward,\" she said. The apparent problem with accessing oral minoxidil \u2014 which is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hair loss \u2014 may be regional rather than nationwide. The FDA does not list minoxidil as a drug in short supply, but spot shortages have been reported anecdotally over the past year. Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, an organization that represents pharmacies nationwide, said he was not surprised that outlets may not always stock 30-day supplies of minoxidil. Even though the pill is meant to treat high blood pressure, it is not often used in emergency health situations. What's more, he said, wholesalers should be able to provide the drug to pharmacies within days. \"Why keep more than a week, maybe 10 days' worth, on the shelf?\" Ganio said. But if the medication is needed urgently, patients may need to call around to different pharmacies to fill their prescription. \"Hair loss is not life-threatening, but let's not underestimate the impact on quality of life,\" Friedman said. \"When people lose their hair, it is extraordinarily disabling.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning parents and caregivers not to buy or serve certain pureed fruit pouches marketed to toddlers and young children because the food might contain dangerous levels of lead. Children who have eaten WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches should be tested for possible lead poisoning, the agency said. Four children in North Carolina were found to have high levels of lead in their blood linked to the puree products, health officials said. State health officials analyzed multiple lots of the product and detected \u201cextremely high\u201d concentrations of lead. The FDA confirmed the results and said they could lead to \u201cacute toxicity.\u201d WanaBana, which is based in Coral Gables, Florida, has recalled all lot codes and expiration dates of the snack products, which are sold nationally, including at Sam\u2019s Club and Dollar Tree and on Amazon. Lead is toxic to people of all ages, but can be especially harmful to children. Most children have no obvious symptoms, so it\u2019s important that kids who are exposed get tested to check levels of lead in their blood. Short-term exposure to lead can result in symptoms that include headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and anemia, the FDA said. Heavy metals like lead can get into food products from soil, air, water or industrial processes, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Lead exposure can seriously harm children\u2019s health, causing damage to the brain and nervous system and slowed growth and development. There is no known safe level of lead exposure, the AAP said.

Matt Manasse, Perry's pickleball mentor and friend of two years, said Perry's death on Saturday is particularly upsetting because the actor appeared to have turned a corner and was living a happy and clean life. \"I spoke to him last week, he was doing great, from what I heard and what I knew,\" Manasse, a noted pickleball coach, told NBC News. \"That\u2019s the worst part about this. When I spoke to him he was chipper and upbeat \u2014 he was who he is, pumped about life.\u201d Perry last year came out with \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir,\" starkly detailing his decadeslong struggle with alcohol and drug addictions. Perry, 54, played pickleball four or five days a week and was on the court Saturday, according to Manasse, fully embracing the sport that the actor viewed as key to his recovery. \u201cI started with him about two years ago and I would bring all different types of people to come and play with him, and he would bring people, too, and people dealing with recovery issues,\u201d Manasse said. \u201cHe fell in love with the sport and he really wanted to use it for his recovery. It was sort of his new thing he could get behind and have on his calendar.

        "title": "Vikings QB Kirk Cousins likely out for season as slew of signal callers suffer injuries",
        "content": "Kirk Cousins, Matthew Stafford, Kenny Pickett and Tyrod Taylor were the latest quarterbacks to go down with injuries. Cousins\u2019 injury is likely the worst of the bunch. Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said the team fears the four-time Pro Bowl QB hurt his Achilles tendon \u2014 and if an MRI confirms the tendon is torn, Cousins\u2019 season would be over. The 35-year-old veteran, who has never missed a game to injury, limped to the sideline after suffering the non-contact injury in the fourth quarter of a 24-10 win at Green Bay on Sunday. He then was carted to the locker room. \u201cI do know that it is going to have to be an injury that makes him not capable physically of playing because if it has anything to do with pain tolerance or a choice to go out on the football field, Kirk Cousins is going to be out on the field,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWe will figure out the severity of it and let you guys know what my fear of is right now of the injury. When we confirm that as an organization we will try to move forward in the short term knowing that I\u2019m not sure anybody in this league overall was playing as well as Kirk at the position this year.\u201d The Vikings could struggle to match Cousins\u2019 production with the other quarterbacks on their roster. Jaren Hall, a rookie fifth-round pick from BYU, replaced him on Sunday. Minnesota has veteran Nick Mullens on injured reserve and Sean Mannion on its practice squad. Stafford couldn\u2019t finish a lopsided loss at Dallas because of a thumb injury. He also bloodied his elbow catching a 2-point conversion in the Rams\u2019 43-20 loss to the Cowboys. Rams coach Sean McVay said he didn\u2019t know the extent of Stafford\u2019s injury. Pickett and Taylor both injured ribs. Pickett left Pittsburgh\u2019s game in the first half after taking a hard shot from Jaguars defensive end Adam Gotsis. Backup Mitch Trubisky threw two interceptions and the Steelers lost 20-10 to visiting Jacksonville. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin didn\u2019t have an update on Pickett\u2019s injury. Taylor was taken to a hospital to be evaluated after injuring his ribs in the first half of the New York Giants\u2019 13-10 overtime loss to the Jets. The team said Taylor would remain hospitalized overnight. Taylor started his third game for Daniel Jones, who has been sidelined by a neck injury. Tommy DeVito, an undrafted rookie out of Illinois and Syracuse and a New Jersey native, replaced Taylor and threw just one pass in regulation. He scored on a 6-yard touchdown run that gave the Giants a lead in the third quarter and finished 2 of 7 for minus-1 yard. Atlanta\u2019s Desmond Ridder was evaluated for a concussion and cleared, but the Falcons switched to Taylor Heinicke in the third quarter of a 28-23 loss at Tennessee. Coach Arthur Smith said he held Ridder out as a precaution. \u201cI\u2019m going to listen to the medical experts and see how this week goes,\u201d Smith said when asked which quarterback will start next week. Titans rookie Will Levis threw four TDs in his NFL debut filling in for Ryan Tannehill, who has an ankle injury. Several QBs played through injuries. Jalen Hurts, who wore a knee brace in the second half of last week\u2019s game, threw four TDs in a 38-31 win at Washington. Brock Purdy started for the 49ers against Cincinnati after suffering a concussion last Monday. The Browns, who played at Seattle, were again without Deshaun Watson because of a shoulder injury. Gardner Minshew made his fourth start for Indianapolis in a 38-27 loss to visiting New Orleans. Colts rookie Anthony Richardson had season-ending shoulder surgery earlier this month. The Jets lost four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers to a torn Achilles tendon in the first quarter in Week 1. Joe Burrow has started every game for the Bengals but struggled throughout September with a calf injury that forced him to miss training camp. ",

        "title": "Effects of psychedelics like magic mushrooms can last for days or weeks, new research finds",
        "content": "After an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot accused of trying to bring down a plane midflight said he had consumed \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d before boarding, psychedelic researchers say the event should be a cautionary tale, especially for people who think they might be able to overcome a tenacious mental illness by taking a psychedelic drug on their own. Over the last five years, research on psychedelic drugs as part of a therapy for mental conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and addiction has exploded. Early study results have been so promising that the Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance in June for designing clinical trials for psychedelic drugs, including MDMA and psilocybin, for mood, anxiety and substance use disorders. It\u2019s unclear whether the off-duty pilot Joseph Emerson, 44, who told authorities after his failed attempt to shut off the plane's engines that he had struggled with depression, was trying to self-medicate by taking psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms. Yet as states consider legalizing or decriminalizing psilocybin \u2014clinics in Oregon began offering psilocybin therapy this summer and Colorado voters approved legalization in 2022  \u2014 some psychedelic researchers worry the dangers are being overlooked. \u201cI\u2019ve been following the growing momentum behind decriminalization and waiting for a headline like this to pop up,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Siegel, a psychiatrist with the program in psychedelics research at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cHopefully, this will lead to a rational conversation about the benefits and risks.\u201d Under controlled circumstances \u2014 screening for a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, careful monitoring of dosages, being prepared for what to expect and close medical supervision of the \u201ctrip,\u201d treatment coupled with psychotherapy \u2014 psychedelics can lead to impressive results, researchers say. Dr. Boris Heifets, an anesthesiologist and co-director of the exploratory therapeutics laboratory at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the therapy's potential for a broad range of mental health conditions is remarkable. \u201cBut every drug treatment, especially one as intense as a psychedelic, is going to have benefits and harms,\u201d Heifets said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trivial amount of risk if you do not know who it is not for.\u201d Current studies exclude patients with bipolar disorder and people with a personal or family history of psychosis, Heifets said. When accompanied by psychotherapy, there is growing evidence that psychedelics can work when other treatments fail. \u201cWe have had very good outcomes in our trials,\u201d said psychiatrist Dr. Joshua Woolley, director of the translational psychedelic research program at the University of California, San Francisco. \"The trials are very well controlled and the dosing is always facilitated,\" Woolley said. \"The patient meets with the therapist beforehand, is educated about what they might experience and has a chance to practice ahead of time in the room where the treatment will take place.\u201d What many people don\u2019t understand about psychedelics, Woolley said, is the impact can last for days, weeks or longer after the substance is no longer detectable in the body. In a new study, British researchers described the experiences of 608 people who were willing to talk about long-lasting difficulties that occurred after they had taken psychedelic drugs.  One participant noted that \u201cfor about 18 months I awoke with the sun every morning full of a feeling of absolute terror. Sometimes my anxiety would be so high in the morning that I would physically shake from the energy.\u201d Another reported: \u201cI felt like the person I was before had been entirely wiped from all sense memory and I felt completely dissociated from the body I was inhabiting\u2026. [I] essentially felt like I was completely disintegrating. My life has and never will be the same.\u201d According to the new study, 15% of the participants experienced \u201cderealization,\" or confusion or uncertainty over what was real in the days, weeks or months after a psychedelic experience. People sometimes had the feeling they were in a \"dream, afterlife, purgatory, a movie, a computer game or fake reality,\u201d the researchers wrote. Researchers don\u2019t know exactly how psychedelics help bring people out of a mental illness when other treatments don't work. There are theories. \u201cYou can imagine that people with a serious mental illness can get stuck,\u201d Woolley said. \u201cWe think the way psychedelics work is they induce a \u2018plastic state,\u2019 where change is possible.\u201d Animal studies have shown that psychedelics can make axons, the long threadlike fibers that transmit messages between nerve cells, start to make new connections, he explained. In the right context, \u201cpsychedelics can get the brain out of a state of depression or anxiety, a cycle of negative thoughts, self-perception, moods and behaviors,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cWhen you look on a cellular level you see an increase in plasticity and to me that is the molecular equivalent to allowing habits to be flexible, making change easier.\u201d It\u2019s thought that people get \u201cstuck\u201d because the brain is designed to be good at developing habits, said Chris Tuell, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience and director of addiction services at the University of Cincinnati\u2019s College of Medicine. The brain develops habits because they are key to survival. If strong connections weren\u2019t made in the brain \u2014 to send us back to where there is food, to have sex to procreate, to stay away from danger \u2014 the species wouldn\u2019t survive, Tuell said. But sometimes that wiring results in unhealthy connections becoming strengthened, resulting in tenacious mental illnesses like long-lasting depression or anxiety. It\u2019s like a car wheel stuck in a rut in the road, unable to pull out, Tuell said. An intense experience, such as a trip on psychedelics, sometimes can jar a person out of that mental rut, experts say. Even in carefully controlled studies, experiences with psychedelics can be \u201ceuphoric, or exhilarating or terrifying,\u201d Heifets said. \u201cContext matters. With support, the treatment can lead to transformation,\" Heifets said. \"If it\u2019s totally uncontrolled, it can potentially lead to what we\u2019re seeing in the news.\u201d Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News.

        "title": "Strep throat is 'zooming back' in some areas of the country, doctors say",
        "content": "Strep throat is surging among children in some pockets of the country, raising concerns that a shortage of antibiotics to treat it could worsen as the nation heads into winter. An unprecedented number of otherwise healthy adults and children are coming into the emergency room at Henry Ford Medical Center \u2014 Fairlane in Dearborn, Michigan, sick with strep, said Dr. Jennifer Stevenson, the head of the emergency department. \"I've been practicing emergency medicine for 25 years, and I have not seen strep throat as frequently as I have in these past six or eight months,\" Stevenson said. In fact, strep has been the second most common diagnosis in Stevenson's emergency department since March, following chest pain. Many of the patients also had Covid. The bacterial illness, marked by painful, scratchy throats and high fevers, has been rising for months in parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, as well. We are \"absolutely seeing a significant increase in strep\" that began over the summer, said Dr. Thomas Lacy, the division chief for Nemours Children's Primary Care. The Nemours system includes children's hospitals and dozens of pediatricians in Delaware, Florida and Pennsylvania. Cases of invasive strep A \u2014 a similar type of bacterium that also causes scarlet fever and impetigo \u2014 have been increasingly diagnosed over the past decade, but it's the common form of the illness that's affecting children in hospitals right now, Stevenson and Lacy said. It's unclear why strep is making a strong comeback this year, though the Covid pandemic did disrupt the typical cadence of seasonal illnesses, such as RSV and the flu. Lacy said his teams in Delaware and Pennsylvania have noted a 300% to 400% increase in strep throat since school began this fall compared to last year. In Florida, the number of strep cases is more than double what it was last year at this time. \"Strep is really zooming back,\" Lacy said. Epic Research, which tracks electronic health records nationwide, has detected a steady increase in strep throat, particularly among kids ages 4 to 12, since the beginning of August. That includes diagnoses made in urgent care facilities and emergency departments and at pediatricians' offices. Fortunately, the strep outbreak isn't everywhere. Some of the largest medical centers in the country reached by NBC News \u2014 including hospitals in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Seattle \u2014 are not seeing notable increases. Doctors aren't usually required to report strep throat diagnoses to their local or state health departments, as they would be for other illnesses, such as Covid or measles, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 5 million outpatient visits each year are due to noninvasive group A strep. After an unusually high spike in strep last year, current strep throat levels appear to be restoring to pre-pandemic proportions, according to the Epic data. That's how it feels for Dr. Victoria Valencia, the interim director of the Health Center for Student Care at Tulane University in New Orleans. Valencia said her team saw an uptick in strep cases on campus right after the semester began this fall. \"Anecdotally, we're seeing similar numbers to what we saw in 2019 before the pandemic,\" Valencia said. \"I don't feel inundated.\" According to Stevenson and Valencia, most children who test positive for strep throat have: Children 12 and younger may also have: Sometimes, untreated strep infections can lead to complications, such as a kind of kidney disease. Strep throat is easily treatable with a widely used antibiotic called amoxicillin, Stevenson said. \"Usually within about 24 hours of starting that antibiotic, the patient's going to feel a whole lot better,\" she said. What's more, children are much less contagious after they start the antibiotic. If strep is left untreated, kids can continue to infect others for weeks, usually through respiratory droplets. But the drug, especially the form given to young children, has been in short supply for a year, according to the Food and Drug Administration. \"This is a very difficult situation,\" Lacy said. \"Spot shortages are forcing us to turn to different antibiotics, sometimes antibiotics that we would not have used\" as first-line treatments. While most pharmacies in Stevenson's area of Michigan have been able to stock the drug, \"I expect that as we get into these cooler months, we're going to see more infections and parents are going to have a difficult time finding this medication for their kids.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "A new Covid variant has become dominant amid slow uptake of the updated shots",
        "content": "A new Covid variant has become dominant in the U.S., but relatively few people have thus far gotten the new shots that could offer some protection against it. The variant, called HV.1, replaced EG.5 as the country's most prevalent this week, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The two variants are genetically similar versions of omicron. HV.1 makes up around 25% of Covid cases now, up from around 1% at the beginning of August. EG.5, meanwhile, represents nearly 22% of cases, down from 24% at the start of the month. Both are descendants of the XBB variant. The updated Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which became available last month, target a different XBB descendant, called XBB.1.5. But disease experts say the new shots should offer cross-protection against the currently dominant strains. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, said that although the vaccine is not a \"perfect match\" for HV.1, \"it\u2019s still a good match because it\u2019s still within the same family of variant.\" However, just around 3.5 % of the U.S. population \u2014 approximately 12 million people \u2014 have received the new Covid shots since they became available in mid-September, a CDC spokesperson said. He cautioned that the number is a rough estimate because states are no longer required to report vaccination numbers. \"I hope uptick increases, but I\u2019m pretty pessimistic,\" Roberts said. \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll hit anywhere near the levels we had last year.\" A few factors have hindered this season's vaccine rollout. On top of the issues of accessibility and hesitancy seen in past vaccination campaigns, this was the first time such vaccines were part of the commercial market instead of being ordered, distributed and funded by the federal government. \"The logistic complications certainly were not helpful, but I think that the low uptake is more than that. The low uptake reflects that most of the public is no longer concerned about Covid,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Barouch said HV.1 could be slighter better than EG.5 at spreading among people or infecting those with prior immunity to Covid \u2014 but not enough to cause alarm among scientists. \"I would expect that it might be a slight increase in transmissibility or immune escape, which is why it appears to be dominating. Does it change any booster recommendations so far? Probably not,\" he said. Since omicron took over in December 2021, all dominant variants have descended from it. Scientists expect the virus to continue to evolve in this way. For the most part, scientists aren't concerned about versions of omicron that look similar to those we\u2019ve seen before. While the CDC recommends updated shots for everyone ages 6 months and up, Barouch said he\u2019s particularly worried about low uptake among older adults and people who are immunosuppressed or have pre-existing medical issues. \"What concerns me is not the overall low number of people getting boosted. What concerns me is the low frequency of high-risk people getting boosted,\" he said. Last fall's vaccine rollout got off to a stronger start: Six weeks after the bivalent booster came out in September 2022, more than 19 million people (5.5% of the population) had received the shot, according to CDC data. About 17% of the U.S. population ultimately received that booster, which isn\u2019t available anymore because it targeted versions of omicron that no longer circulate widely. In the current rollout, public and private insurers are responsible for the cost of the shot, and health care and pharmacy networks place their own orders. That has given rise to new challenges, including insurance issues, shipment delays and appointment cancelations. Though most insurers agreed to cover the new Covid vaccines in full, some didn't update their billing systems in time for people's appointments. As a result, people were told they needed to pay for their shots, prompting some to cancel their scheduled vaccinations. The Biden administration said at the end of September that the issues had largely been resolved. Delayed vaccine shipments also forced some pharmacies to cancel appointments last month. And parents have reported difficulty finding appointments for young children, who require smaller doses. Roberts said some pediatricians\u2019 offices may not be equipped to provide cold storage for the shots or lack freezer space. Others may have underestimated demand or been unwilling to pay for large shipments. Experts worry that people who hit roadblocks will stop attempting to get vaccinated. \"If people try and are unable to get their vaccine, then it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll never go back and try again,\" Barouch said. Roberts said his children still haven\u2019t gotten their updated vaccines, despite his best efforts. He also ran into trouble getting his own shot, he said: His hospital was waiting on doses, and local pharmacies in New Haven, Connecticut, weren't offering appointments. He ended up traveling outside the region to get vaccinated. \"I\u2019m an infectious disease physician who works with Covid. I cannot imagine how difficult this is for the normal person out there in the community who wants to get vaccinated,\" Roberts said. Though Covid transmission seems to be slowing right now, Roberts cautioned that the virus is still making people severely ill. \"We have patients today in our hospital admitted with this on mechanical ventilators,\" he said, adding: \"We definitely need to push to get the high-risk people vaccinated because that's the strain on the health care system.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "A new cure for sickle cell disease may be coming. FDA advisers will review it next week.",
        "content": "The only cure for painful sickle cell disease today is a bone marrow transplant. But soon there may be a new cure that attacks the disorder at its genetic source. On Tuesday, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review a gene therapy for the inherited blood disorder, which in the U.S. mostly affects Black people. Issues they will consider include whether more research is needed into possible unintended consequences of the treatment. If approved by the FDA, it would be the first gene therapy on the U.S. market based on CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. The agency is expected to decide on the treatment in early December, before taking up a different sickle cell gene therapy later that month. Dr. Allison King, who cares for children and young adults with sickle cell disease, said she\u2019s enthusiastic about the possibility of new treatments. \u201cAnything that can help relieve somebody with this condition of the pain and the multiple health complications is amazing,\u201d said King, a professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s horribly painful. Some people will say it\u2019s like being stabbed all over.\u201d The disorder affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A genetic mutation causes the cells to become crescent-shaped, which can block blood flow and cause excruciating pain, organ damage, stroke and other problems. Millions of people around the world, including about 100,000 in the U.S., have the disease. It occurs more often among people from places where malaria is or was common, like Africa and India, and is also more common in certain ethnic groups, such as people of African, Middle Eastern and Indian descent. Scientists believe being a carrier of the sickle cell trait helps protect against severe malaria. Current treatments include medications and blood transfusions. The only permanent solution is a bone marrow transplant, which must come from a closely matched donor without the disease and brings a risk of rejection. No donor is required for the one-time gene therapy, \u201cexa-cel,\u201d made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. This new treatment involves permanently changing DNA in a patient\u2019s blood cells. The goal is to help the body go back to producing a fetal form of hemoglobin \u2014 which is naturally present at birth but then switches to an adult form that\u2019s defective in people with sickle cell disease. When patients undergo the treatment, stem cells are removed from their blood and CRISPR is used to knock out the switching gene. Patients get medicines to kill off other flawed blood-producing cells and then are given back their own altered stem cells. The treatment has been tested in a relatively small number of patients thus far, the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said in an evidence report. In a briefing document released Friday before the advisory committee meeting, Vertex said 46 people got the treatment in the pivotal study. Of 30 who had at least 18 months of follow-up, 29 were free of pain crises for at least a year and all 30 avoided being hospitalized for pain crises for that long. The company called the treatment \u201ctransformative\u201d and said it has \u201ca strong safety profile.\u201d Victoria Gray, of Mississippi, the first patient to test the treatment, shared her experience with researchers at a scientific conference earlier this year. She described suffering with terrible bouts of pain since childhood and receiving high-dose pain medications and sometimes blood transfusions. She described feeling she \u201cwas being reborn\u201d the day she got the gene therapy. Now, she\u2019s able to run around with her kids and work a full-time job. \u201cMy children no longer have a fear of losing their mom to sickle cell disease,\u201d she said. But the FDA is asking an outside panel of gene therapy experts next week to discuss a lingering issue that often comes up when discussing CRISPR: the possibility of \u201coff-target effects,\u201d which are unexpected, unwanted changes to a person\u2019s genome. The FDA is looking for advice on whether the company\u2019s research on such effects was adequate to assess the risk or whether additional studies are needed. While the agency doesn\u2019t have to follow the group\u2019s advice, it often does. If the treatment is allowed on the market, the company has proposed a post-approval safety study, product labeling outlining potential risks and continuing research. The FDA is expected to decide on the second gene therapy for sickle cell, made by Bluebird Bio, before the end of the year. Bluebird\u2019s treatment works differently. It aims to add functional copies of a modified gene, which helps red blood cells produce \u201canti-sickling\u201d hemoglobin that prevents or reverses misshapen cells. The companies have not released potential prices for either therapy, but the institute report said prices up to around $2 million would be cost-effective. By comparison, research earlier this year showed medical expenses for current sickle cell treatments, from birth to age 65, add up to about $1.6 million for women and $1.7 million for men. King, the St. Louis doctor, acknowledged the new treatments would be expensive. \u201cBut if you think about it,\u201d she said, \u201chow much is it worth for someone to feel better and not be in pain and not be in the hospital all the time?\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "Arizona's Maricopa County shatters record for heat deaths",
        "content": "Health officials in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County reported nearly 500 heat-related deaths this summer, making 2023 the region\u2019s deadliest year on record when it comes to extreme temperatures. In its latest weekly heat report, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health said there have been 469 confirmed heat-associated deaths so far this year, with an additional 153 deaths still under investigation. That number surpasses the previous record set last year of 425 heat-associated deaths in the county. Across the United States, extreme heat causes more deaths each year than any other weather event, including floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. That threat is expected to worsen in the years ahead, as studies have shown that climate change is increasing the frequency, severity and persistence of extreme heat events. This summer, Arizona and other parts of the Southwest sweltered through weeks of temperatures well into the triple digits. In Phoenix, which is in Maricopa County, residents endured 31 back-to-back days of 110 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in July, a milestone that shattered the city\u2019s previous heat record of 18 consecutive days above 110 degrees set in 1974. Also in July, Maricopa County saw huge spikes in heat-associated deaths as daily high temperatures neared 120. In one week alone, from July 16 to July 22, there were around 150 heat-related deaths in the county, according to the report. More than 60% of the confirmed heat-associated deaths in Maricopa County were in adults over the age of 50. People 50 to 64 were most affected by extreme heat, accounting for 29% of heat-related deaths in the county. Health officials said individuals experiencing homelessness accounted for 44% of heat-associated deaths, while 45% of deaths were among the housed population. In 11% of the deaths, the person\u2019s living situation was not known, according to the report. White, non-Hispanic individuals made up 58% of the heat-associated deaths in the county, with Hispanic or Latino making up 23% of deaths and Black or African American individuals making up 13% of heat-related deaths in Maricopa County. Health officials said 122 deaths occurred indoors, of which 92 were discovered with nonfunctioning air conditioning and 11 with no air conditioning present at all. Even in nonfatal cases, heat still posed a major public health threat in Arizona. Hospital visits in Maricopa County spiked throughout July and early August, as temperatures soared well over 100 degrees, according to the report.

        "title": "Mpox vaccinations should be recommended for high-risk men, even after outbreak ends, advisers say",
        "content": "Gay and bisexual men at high risk for mpox infection should get vaccinated for the virus even after the current outbreak ends, government health advisers said Wednesday. The committee\u2019s recommendation now goes to the director to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \u2014 if she signs off on it \u2014 is sent out as guidance to U.S. doctors. More than 30,000 U.S. mpox cases were reported last year. The number dropped dramatically this year, to about 800. But because the virus doesn\u2019t naturally circulate in the U.S., any single case counts as an outbreak, according to the CDC. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. The virus was not known to spread easily among people, but cases exploded in Europe and the U.S. in the spring and summer of 2022, mostly among men who have sex with men. Deaths were rare, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, became a primary weapon in the U.S. It\u2019s recommended primarily for men who have sex with men who have more than one sex partner, who have recently had a sexually transmitted disease, or who are at higher risk for infections through sexual contact for other reasons. About 500,000 people in the U.S. have gotten the recommended two doses of the vaccine, about a quarter of the 2 million who are eligible, CDC officials said. The new recommendation may serve to remind people the virus is still out there, and that people can be infected during international travel, CDC officials said. The daily average of new U.S. cases is one to four per day, though some people likely aren\u2019t being diagnosed, CDC officials said. Two deaths were reported in September, bringing the total to 54 in the U.S. since mpox hit last year. San Francisco had more than 800 cases last year, but the count dropped to an average of only one per month in the first half this of year. The number of cases rose to seven in August, 20 last month and at least 10 so far this month. \u201cThings are much better than they were last summer,\u201d said Dr. Stephanie Cohen, who oversees STD prevention work at San Francisco\u2019s health department. \u201cBut there are (still) many more cases than there should be.\u201d ",

        "title": "FDA warns about probiotics linked to infant death",
        "content": "Probiotics can be extremely risky for very young babies and have been linked to at least one infant death, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.  The infant death linked to probiotics occurred this year, the FDA said. Since 2018, there have been more than two dozen adverse events in infants linked to the products, and the agency is investigating whether probiotics have contributed to other cases in babies. There are no FDA-approved probiotics for infants of any age, the agency said. Some products, however, are illegally sold to treat diseases in preterm infants in hospital settings, the FDA said. Probiotics \u2014 which contain live bacteria or other microorganisms \u2014 are commonly used as dietary supplements in the U.S. Because they are supplements, not drugs, the FDA doesn't review them for their safety or effectiveness. Last month, the agency sent a letter to health care providers, warning them about the use of probiotics in preterm infants, due to the risk of \u201cinvasive, potentially fatal\u201d infections. The letter mentioned a preterm infant who, while still in the hospital after birth, had been given a probiotic product called Evivo with MCT Oil, made by the company Infinant Health. The baby developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition that happens when the body\u2019s immune system has an extreme response to an infection, and subsequently died, the letter said. The letter didn't say where the death occurred. Infinant Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FDA also said Thursday that it sent a warning letter to Abbott Laboratories on Tuesday about one of its products, Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend, which was being sold for use in preterm infants in hospitals. It contains three bacterial strains: B. infantis, S. thermophilus and B. lactis. It\u2019s unclear whether the product led to any adverse events in babies, but Abbott agreed to discontinue sales and is working with the FDA to \u201ctake additional corrective actions,\u201d according to the agency. Abbott did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FDA has previously warned that probiotics have been documented in medical literature to cause serious bacterial or fungal infections, particularly in very preterm or very low birthweight infants. \"We especially want to make clear that products containing live microorganisms may present serious risks to preterm infants in hospital settings,\" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement Thursday. \"We want to caution parents, caregivers and healthcare providers about these products when used for the prevention or treatment of disease, as they have not undergone the agency\u2019s rigorous premarket process to evaluate their safety and effectiveness for these uses,\" Marks said. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend the use of probiotics in preterm infants, although the organization says about 10% of preterm infants receive a probiotic during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit.

        "title": "As Gaza's health care system collapses, Americans mourn loved ones who 'could have been saved'",
        "content": "Adnan Sawada was at work in Maryland on Oct. 17 when he got a frantic phone call from thousands of miles away in Gaza. It was his 36-year-old nephew calling with devastating news. His father, Adnan\u2019s oldest brother, had just died at a Gaza hospital. \u201cHis son was screaming,\u201d Adnan said in a phone interview. \u201cThey got to him too late.\u201d Shaaban Sawada, Adnan\u2019s brother, is one of the countless Gaza residents who were injured in airstrikes but were then unable to receive the care they needed at the enclave\u2019s overwhelmed hospitals.  According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 6,500 people have been killed in the Israeli bombing of Gaza, which began after Hamas\u2019 surprise terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed 1,400 people. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said in a statement that Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, al-Shifa, was at 150% capacity. Others are shut down or partially out of service because of damage from airstrikes and lack of fuel to supply electric generators. The United Nations said fuel supplies in the Gaza Strip would run out by Thursday.   Follow live coverage from NBC News here. At al-Shifa hospital Tuesday, the scene was pure chaos \u2014 hallways filled with children screaming out in pain and bloodied with severe injuries. Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British plastic and reconstructive surgeon at al-Shifa, who traveled to Gaza at the start of the war to help, said 40% of the wounded he has been treating are children. Many of their injuries include burns covering huge parts of their bodies. \u201cOver the past 24 hours, we have received 600 dead and three times the number of wounded,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is putting even more pressure on the system that\u2019s falling apart.\u201d Al-Shifa was already running out of supplies two weeks ago when Abu-Sittah arrived. Now hospital workers lack simple dressings for all the burns they\u2019re treating. Because there\u2019s not enough anesthesia equipment or anesthesiologists for surgery, the medical staff has been forced to use ketamine as an anesthetic, Abu-Sittah said. Ketamine can be used for general anesthesia, but it\u2019s typically used only for shorter procedures, like fixing dislocations and fractures. Adnan Sawada\u2019s brother Shaaban never got anesthesia when he went to one of the Gaza hospitals. He had been standing outside in southern Gaza when the building next door was hit, Adnan said. His leg was severely cut in the blast. \u201cThe hospital didn\u2019t take him right away,\u201d Adnan said. \u201cMy thinking is that they didn\u2019t take him right away because the hospital is filled with injured people, especially young people.\u201d Adnan said his nephew told him that Shaaban bled to death while he was waiting for a doctor to see him. \u201cHe could have been saved,\u201d Adnan said. \u201cI\u2019m not angry about the doctors. I\u2019m angry about the lack of help.\u201d For Americans with family in Gaza, the humanitarian crisis continues to spark deep fears that their loved ones won\u2019t make it. \u201cEvery conversation, we just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be the last time you talk to them,\u201d said a Houston man of Palestinian descent, who still has many family members in Gaza. He requested that his name not be used out of fear that his family could become targets. He has already lost one cousin in the conflict, he said in an interview. Another cousin lost a hand in a blast and couldn\u2019t get care at the hospital. One of his aunts has Type 1 diabetes and is running out of insulin. Another cousin is pregnant in her third trimester. \u201cNot only is my pregnant cousin not able to see a doctor to get routine checkups;, we\u2019re worried she\u2019s going to have to have the baby in the current conditions,\u201d he said, adding that she\u2019s an American citizen. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much.

        "title": "A spider was found inside a woman's ear. Such cases are rare, doctors say, but not unheard of.",
        "content": "It started with a strange sensation in her left ear: the feeling of movement, followed by incessant clicking and rustling sounds. After struggling to sleep for several nights, the 64-year-old woman in Taiwan visited an ear, nose and throat clinic. There, doctors discovered a small spider moving about her ear canal. It had discarded its exoskeleton, which sat nearby. Doctors in April used a tube to suction out the spider and exoskeleton, according to a case report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"She didn't feel pain because the spider was very small. It's just about 2 to 3 millimeters,\" said Dr. Tengchin Wang, the report's co-author and the director of the otolaryngology department at Tainan Municipal Hospital. (Two-and-a-half millimeters is about one-tenth of an inch.) Wang said he wrote the report because of the case's novelty: He had seen ants, moths, cockroaches and mosquitoes inside people's ears before, but never an insect that molted inside an ear canal. He urged the public to see a doctor if they ever experience such symptoms. Discovering an insect inside a person's ear is rare but not unheard of, doctors in the U.S. say. Most ear, nose and throat specialists see \"tens, if not more, of bugs or some sort of arthropod\" in ear canals throughout their career, according to Dr. David Kasle, a physician at ENT Sinus and Allergy of South Florida, who wasn't involved in the new research. However, the image in Wang's report is \"unusual and disturbing,\" Kasle said. Past research suggests that live insects represent at least 14% of foreign objects found in people's ear canals. Other commonly identified objects include cotton balls, beads and earring backings. In 2020, doctors found a Japanese beetle inside the ear of a 14-year-old girl in Pennsylvania. She had been swimming in a pool, then detected a crawling sensation in her right ear. The year before, a 9-year-old boy in Connecticut reported buzzing noises in his right ear, which prompted Kasle and a colleague to discover a tick lodged in the boy's eardrum. While children may have a harder time distinguishing a bug in their ear from a general earache, adults should be able to tell right away. \u201cThere\u2019s an extremely sensitive, thin layer of skin that lines the ear canal called the external auditory canal,\u201d Kasle said. \u201cBecause of its sensitivity, you\u2019re obviously going to feel the crawling sensation, a tickle sensation that is almost unbearable.\u201d Dr. Stacey Ishman, an otolaryngology instructor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, estimated that she has treated about eight patients with insects in their ears over her 23-year career \u2014 often people who did outdoor activities like camping. \"Most of the time the ear is completely fine,\" said Ishman, who also wasn't involved in the new report. \"If there\u2019s some injury to the ear canal, quite honestly it\u2019s more often from people trying to get it out than it is from the bug itself.\u201d People who suspect a bug may be inside their ear shouldn't stick their finger inside because the insect could sting them, according to the National Library of Medicine. Nor should they use tweezers or a paperclip, since such instruments can damage the eardrum or cause bleeding or infection. Ishman further cautioned against putting a Q-tip in the ear, which can lodge the insect in farther. A safe option, according to doctors, is to pour vegetable oil, olive oil or baby oil into the ear to drown the bug or help it slide out. Doctors also suggest tilting your ear to the ground and shaking your head to get the bug to exit on its own. In the new report, Wang recommended using lidocaine or ethanol to kill larger insects, thereby stopping them from moving and damaging the ear. That step should be avoided, however, if a person's eardrum has a hole in it \u2014 which may be hard for people to determine on their own. Even those who've removed an insect from their ear should see a doctor, Ishman said, because parts of the bug \u2014 like an antenna \u2014could be left behind. \"We can get a really up-close view and we can make sure everything's thoroughly removed,\" she said.

The funds sought by the Biden administration would be included alongside money for grants to states, territories and tribes through a Department of Health and Human Services program that aims to help strengthen addiction treatment, overdose prevention measures and recovery support services. \u201cAs we continue to lose an American life to drug overdose every five minutes around the clock, Congress must come together and take immediate action,\u201d Dr. Rahul Gupta, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement. \u201cToday, we are calling on Congress to help advance the Administration\u2019s ongoing work to connect more people to treatment and build healthy, safe and resilient communities. As a physician who has spent decades treating patients and administering life-saving overdose reversal medications, I cannot underscore the importance of these critical public health funds enough,\" Gupta added. The administration had asked Congress for money focused on foreign policy and border issues, including an additional 1,000 law enforcement personnel and investigative capabilities to prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the country. Researchers last month found the U.S. was in a \u201cfourth wave\u201d of the opioid crisis, with the proportion of overdoses involving fentanyl and a stimulant found to have increased more than fiftyfold from 2010 to 2021. Legislation to address opioid overdoses hasn't come to a floor vote in either chamber this year. The SUPPORT act, a bill passed in 2018 that provided $20 billion toward opioid use treatment, prevention and recovery, expired Sept. 30. In July, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, introduced the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act to uphold prevention, treatment and recovery services provided by the original SUPPORT act. The legislation hasn't come before the committee for consideration. \u201cTens of thousands of Americans are dying each year from drug overdoses. We need a markup and a reauthorization of the SUPPORT Act to evaluate and improve these life-saving programs. Missing these deadlines puts vital resources in jeopardy,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement to NBC News. As chair of the committee, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is responsible for scheduling a mark-up to allow for the new act to be considered. Sanders' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In the House, the SUPPORT act was unanimously voted out of the Energy and Commerce Committee this year but hasn't been brought to the floor for a vote. Rep. David Trone, D-Md., a co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, told NBC News that he believes that the recent dysfunction in the House has prevented the bipartisan bill from reaching the floor. \u201cFor the last three weeks, the House floor has been paralyzed as House Republicans struggle to elect a new Speaker \u2014 effectively neutering the chamber\u2019s ability to move any legislation, including bills that have wide support such as the SUPPORT Act,\u201d Trone said in a statement before Wednesday's speaker vote. House Republicans elected a new speaker Wednesday, 21 days after Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted. With a backlog of legislation during that period, the prospects for the SUPPORT act are unclear. Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., a co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, acknowledged that partisanship has kept the legislation from getting to the floor. \u201cCongress hasn\u2019t focused on this is because of the hyper-partisan politics that have taken place recently,\" she said in a statement. \"Taking on the opioid epidemic requires bipartisanship, and right now we have too much infighting in the halls of the House to refocus on what\u2019s really important regarding substance use disorder.\u201d Kyla Guilfoil is an intern for NBC News Digital Politics.

        "title": "Exposure to hazardous chemicals in the womb may be linked to rapid childhood weight gain, study finds",
        "content": "Babies exposed to a set of common chemicals in the womb may be at higher risk of gaining weight rapidly during early childhood, a recent study suggests.  The research, published last week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, identified a link between exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in utero and a rapid increase in a child\u2019s body mass index from birth to 9 years of age.  The category of chemicals studied includes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2014 better known as PFAS or \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how slowly they degrade \u2014 as well as some compounds used in or derived from fungicides and pesticides. Such chemicals can be found in everyday items, including nonstick cookware, cosmetic products and plastic food containers, as well as in some meat and fish if the animals were exposed to contaminated land or water. They are thought to interact with humans\u2019 endocrine systems by mimicking natural hormones. The new findings are based on data from more than 1,900 pairs of mothers and children in Spain, gathered from 2003 to 2008. The women, whose racial breakdown was not described, gave blood and urine samples during pregnancy, from which the researchers measured the concentration of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in their bodies. Then the scientists measured their children\u2019s BMIs at several points up to age 9. (BMI is a measure of body fat based on one\u2019s height and weight, though the metric is not necessarily a good indicator of individual health.) The results of the analysis showed that babies with more exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals before birth were more likely to be born smaller than the study group\u2019s average, then experience rapid growth during their early years of life. Exposure to two chemicals in particular was also associated with a higher risk of rapid BMI gain after a baby was born larger than average. A possible reason for the correlation, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Parisa Montazeri, is that endocrine-disrupting chemicals can mimic or block hormones involved in breaking down food for energy, which can in turn alter the body\u2019s hunger cues or sensitivity to sugar and fats. \u201cThis is what can cause some of those weight issues,\u201d she said. Montazeri, who works as a scientific coordinator at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said a rapid increase in BMI during childhood is linked to health issues into adulthood, including obesity, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. So pinpointing early factors that can contribute to those health issues may better enable doctors to intervene to mitigate the risk of disease later in life. \u201cIt also contributes to explaining a piece of the puzzle as to why obesity is on the rise,\u201d Montazeri said, though she noted that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are just \u201cone aspect that helps explain this phenomenon, along with the typical sedentary lifestyle and eating.\u201d She said the most concerning chemicals are those that don\u2019t degrade for decades, such as PFAS \u2014 found in stain- or water-resistant products \u2014 and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are used as lubricants in electrical equipment and in some oil-based paints and floor finishes. Other endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates and parabens, don\u2019t stay in the body much longer than a day, Montazeri said, but people can be regularly exposed through personal care products such as shampoo and hair spray. Exposure to chemicals during pregnancy is particularly concerning, several experts said, because a fetus\u2019 organs are still forming.  The exposure can therefore \u201chave a larger effect on a baby or a person developing at this time than they would at other points in your life,\u201d said Dr. Brigid Gregg, an assistant professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Michigan, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. Past research has similarly found a link between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and weight gain in childhood. A June study found that exposure to PFAS in the womb was slightly associated with a risk of obesity in children and adolescents, and research published in 2021 found that exposure to a type of pesticide in utero was linked to a higher risk of infants\u2019 becoming overweight. A 2020 study, meanwhile, found that prenatal exposure to phthalates and  bisphenols \u2014 another endocrine-disrupting chemical found in plastic items like water bottles \u2014 was linked to increased fat around the heart in children. However, most studies on the topic so far have looked at the health effects of just one or two types of chemicals, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a pediatrics professor at New York University. The new study examines how a broader combination can affect childhood development, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not exposed to one chemical at a time,\u201d said Trasande, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cWe\u2019re probably exposed to tens of thousands, at least, of chemicals at any given time, of which a smaller subset are probably the most problematic.\u201d Montazeri said pregnant women can make adjustments to limit exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. A mother of two herself, Montazeri said that when she was pregnant, she avoided storing food in plastic containers and didn\u2019t heat plastic in the microwave. She also cooked with stainless steel pans or cast-iron skillets instead of nonstick pans, which can contain PFAS. And she avoided eating large fish, such as swordfish or tuna, which can contain higher concentrations of mercury and chemicals. She further suggested that pregnant women eat organic food when possible, because that limits pesticide exposure, and check for parabens and phthalates on the ingredient labels of personal care products such as lotion or nail polish.  In the long run, Trasande said, he hopes to see the U.S. enact new regulations that reduce people\u2019s exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. \u201cWe\u2019ve been unwitting participants in an unnatural experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the implications are very clear that we need to be more proactive about reducing exposures to these chemicals.\u201d Katie Mogg is an intern at NBC News.

        "title": "Around 20 minutes of exercise a day may balance out the harms of sitting, study finds",
        "content": "People who have no choice but to sit at a desk for hours on end may have seen, in recent years, a slew of headlines about the scary consequences of sitting for long periods of time \u2014 and how even regular exercise couldn\u2019t undo the damage. Research published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, however, finds that about 22 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous activity may provide an antidote to the ills of prolonged sitting. What\u2019s more, the researchers found that, as a person\u2019s activity level increases, the risk of dying prematurely from any cause goes down.  The study found that the current recommendation of 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity \u201cis enough to counteract the detrimental health effect of prolonged sitting,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Edvard Sagelv, a researcher at The Arctic University of Norway. \u201cThis is the beautiful part: we are talking about activities that make you breathe a little bit heavier, like brisk walking, or gardening or walking up a hill.\u201d While 150 minutes may seem like a lot, Sagelv broke it down into manageable terms. \u201cThink of it: only 20 minutes of this a day is enough, meaning, a small stroll of 10 minutes twice a day \u2014 like jumping off the bus one stop before your actual destination to work and then when taking the bus back home, jumping off one stop before,\u201d he said in an email. The new research appears to upend findings from earlier studies showing that regular exercise didn\u2019t zero out the negative effects associated with extended periods of sitting. One of those studies, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2017, found that working out regularly reduced some of the harms associated with hours of sitting, but didn\u2019t completely eliminate them. In the study, researchers looked at information from nearly 12,000 people ages 50 and older in four datasets from Norway, Sweden and the United States. In those datasets, the participants wore movement detection devices on their hips for 10 hours a day for at least four days. All of the individuals included in the new study were tracked for at least two years. In the new analysis, the researchers accounted for factors, including medical conditions, that could\u2019ve affected risk of early death.  About half of the participants spent 10 \u00bd hours or more sedentary each day.   When the researchers linked the participants\u2019 information with death registries in the different countries, they found that over an average of five years, 805 people, or 17%, had died. Of those who died, 357, or 6%, had spent less than 10 \u00bd hours a day seated, while 448 averaged 10 \u00bd  hours or more sedentary. Sitting for more than 12 hours a day, the researchers found, was associated with a 38% increased risk of death as compared to eight hours, but only among those who managed to get less than 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day. The risk of death went down with increasing amounts of physical activity. An extra 10 minutes a day translated into a 15% lower risk of death among those spending fewer than 10 \u00bd  hours seated and a 35% lower risk among those who spent more than 10 \u00bd  hours sedentary each day. Lower intensity activity only made a difference among participants who spent 12 or more hours sitting every day.    Sagelv said he believes the new study is more accurate than previous research because he and his colleagues painstakingly adjusted data from the four datasets so that the individuals in them were more comparable to one another and thus their data could be treated as if they were all participating in a single study. Prolonged sitting is becoming a bigger and bigger problem, said Benjamin Boudreaux, a research scientist in the division of behavioral cardiology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, who was not involved with the new research. More activity can easily be incorporated into the schedules of even the busiest people, Boudreaux said.  \u201cI always tell people if they are pressed for time, when you go grocery shopping or running errands, park your car far away in the lot. If you have a meeting with co-workers, do a walking meeting.\u201d Dr. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, said he worries that people will take the wrong message from the study and \u201cthink all they need is 22 minutes of activity, that it will make them bulletproof like Kevlar and after that they can plunk down in a chair.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cpeople should look at this and then speak to their physician or trainer about it.\u201d \u201cAsk what they think about the strategy of 22 minutes of activity a day being an antidote to sitting,\u201d said Weintraud, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.  The good news from this study is that even a minimum amount of activity will help decrease the risk of premature death related to prolonged sitting, said Dr. Joseph Herrera, professor and chair of the department of rehabilitation and human performance at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. \u201cIt says that 20 to 25 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity for those who are sedentary \u2014 walking briskly, pushing a lawn mower, riding a bicycle at a speed of 10 to 12 miles per hour \u2014 can make a difference,\u201d said Herrera, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean if you\u2019re already active and exercising you can cut down to 20 minutes, the bare minimum.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "As RSV cases tick up, CDC warns that a key drug to keep babies safe is in short supply",
        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted doctors nationwide Monday about a limited availability of certain doses of a newly approved antibody drug given to infants to prevent RSV infection. Cases of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, have started to rise as cold and flu season begins. \"RSV season is here,\" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. \"We are seeing a substantial increase in the amount of RSV such that in many areas, it has become the most commonly identified respiratory virus causing disease in children. \"This is one of the reasons why there's probably a lot of scrambling going on,\" he said, \"to identify those babies at highest risk and to try to prioritize them, since it's such a limited resource right now.\" The Food and Drug Administration approved the antibody drug, called Beyfortus, in July. It is not a vaccine, but it acts similarly to one: Instead of prompting the immune system to develop its own antibodies to RSV, it delivers antibodies directly to the blood via injection. Newborns and infants can get doses of Beyfortus during their first RSV seasons, and children up to age 2 who are at high risk for severe illness from the virus can get second doses during their second RSV seasons. According to the CDC alert, the highest dosage, 100 milligrams, is in limited supply. The agency told doctors to prioritize getting those doses to infants at the highest risk of severe RSV, including infants younger than 6 months and those with underlying conditions. The CDC also advised doctors to preserve 50 mg doses for infants who weigh less than 11 pounds. Drugmaker Sanofi said in a statement Oct. 13, \"Despite an aggressive supply plan built to outperform past pediatric vaccine launches, demand for this product, especially for the 100 mg doses used primarily for babies born before the RSV season, has been higher than anticipated.\" The FDA said the drug is not listed as being in shortage in its database. Another option to prevent RSV infections in infants is the antibody drug Synagis. It is approved only for high-risk infants, however, and it can be given only during RSV season. In August, the FDA approved the RSV vaccine Abrysvo for use in pregnant women in their third trimesters. Doing so provides protection to their babies in their first six months of life.

        "title": "Family sues Panera Bread after college student who drank Charged Lemonade dies",
        "content": "An Ivy League student with a heart condition died after she drank Panera Bread\u2019s Charged Lemonade, a large cup of which contains more caffeine than cans of Red Bull and Monster energy drinks combined, according to a lawsuit. The legal complaint, which was filed Monday morning in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and was first obtained by NBC News, calls the beverage a \u201cdangerous energy drink\u201d and argues that Panera failed to appropriately warn consumers about its ingredients.  The suit was filed on behalf of the parents of Sarah Katz, 21, a University of Pennsylvania student who had taught CPR in underserved communities and had been a research assistant at a children\u2019s hospital. Katz had a heart condition called long QT syndrome type 1 and avoided energy drinks at the recommendation of her doctors, according to the filing.  In a statement Monday afternoon, a Panera spokesperson said: \u201cWe were very saddened to learn this morning about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz, and our hearts go out to her family. At Panera, we strongly believe in transparency around our ingredients. We will work quickly to thoroughly investigate this matter.\u201d Katz bought a Charged Lemonade from a Panera Bread restaurant in Philadelphia on Sept. 10, 2022, according to the suit. She went into cardiac arrest hours later, said her roommate and close friend, Victoria Rose Conroy. \u201cShe was very, very vigilant about what she needed to do to keep herself safe,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cI guarantee if Sarah had known how much caffeine this was, she never would have touched it with a 10-foot pole.\u201d The Charged Lemonade was \u201coffered side-by-side with all of Panera\u2019s non-caffeinated and/or less caffeinated drinks\u201d and was advertised as a \u201cplant-based and clean\u201d beverage that contained as much caffeine as the restaurant\u2019s dark roast coffee, according to photos of both the menu and beverage dispensers in the store, which were included in the wrongful death lawsuit.  But at 390 milligrams, the large Charged Lemonade has more caffeine than any size of Panera\u2019s dark roast coffee, the complaint says \u2014 numbers that the nutrition facts on Panera\u2019s website confirm. It also has guarana extract, another stimulant, as well as the equivalent of nearly 30 teaspoons of sugar, the complaint continues, adding that 390 milligrams of caffeine is higher than the caffeine content of standard cans of Red Bull and Monster energy drinks combined. Katz had gotten the large cup, which is 30 fluid ounces, according to the attorney representing her family.   \u201cI think everyone thinks lemonade is safe. And really, this isn\u2019t lemonade at all. It\u2019s an energy drink that has lemon flavor,\u201d said Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC. \u201cIt should have an adequate warning.\u201d The lawsuit alleges the Charged Lemonade is \u201cdefective in design because it is a dangerous energy drink.\u201d \u201cThese unregulated beverages include no warning of any potentially dangerous effects, even the life-threatening effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and/or brain function,\u201d it says. Conroy described Katz as an excellent student and \u201cthe most involved and passionate person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d someone who would smile and wave to everyone on campus. She was careful to tell people that she could not consume energy drinks and made other modifications for her health condition, but she \u201cnever let it stop her from achieving the things that she wanted to do,\u201d Conroy said. Katz was diagnosed with long QT syndrome at age 5, Crawford said. The American Heart Association describes long QT as a disorder of the heart\u2019s electrical system that can cause abnormal heart rhythms as a result of exercise or stress; it can be well-managed with medication. In addition to medication, Katz\u2019s condition was controlled by regular doctor visits, where \u201ceverything was always normal,\u201d Crawford said.  About 1 in 2,000 people have congenital long QT syndrome, with some showing no symptoms and others fainting or experiencing heart palpitations in response to triggers such as exercise or being startled, said Dr. Charles Berul, an electrophysiologist at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington.  Berul, who did not treat Katz and is not involved in the lawsuit, said caffeine is allowable in moderation for long QT patients.  \u201cWe tell people not to worry, it\u2019s fine to have a Coke or a small coffee each day,\u201d said Berul, who is on the board of trustees of the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes Foundation, an advocacy organization for those with heart rhythm abnormalities.  \u201cBut some of the smaller studies have shown that energy drinks, drinks that have caffeine plus other ingredients like taurine, other things, might be a little riskier,\u201d Berul said. The lawsuit says Katz bought an Unlimited Sip Club membership from Panera, which allows customers to pay a monthly fee for unlimited drinks, about a week and a half before she died. Conroy said Katz had bought at least one other Charged Lemonade in the days before her cardiac arrest. On the day of her death, Katz bought a Charged Lemonade and collapsed several hours later at a birthday gathering for a friend at a restaurant, Conroy said. Emergency personnel took her to the hospital, where she went into cardiac arrest again, this time fatally, the lawsuit says.  \u201cShe was taken from us so soon, and she shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cShe had so much more to give.\u201d  A medical examiner\u2019s report that Crawford shared with NBC News showed that Katz\u2019s cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia due to long QT syndrome. The report does not mention the beverage as a contributing factor but notes that she had no drugs in her system other than what the hospital used to try to resuscitate her.  Caffeine can have health consequences for people beyond those with long QT syndrome and other heart disorders. Large amounts can also pose risks to people with other underlying conditions, as well as to pregnant or breastfeeding people and to children, the Food and Drug Administration says. According to Panera\u2019s website, the caffeine content of its Charged Lemonade ranges from 260 milligrams in the regular size to 390 milligrams in the large, 30-ounce size, while the caffeine content of its dark roast coffee ranges from 161 milligrams in a small cup to 268 milligrams in a large cup, which is 20 fluid ounces. Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade has attracted attention on social media. In December, a customer who said she did not know how caffeinated the drink was shared a viral TikTok video of herself after she had consumed free refills of the mango yuzu Charged Lemonade and captioned the video, \u201cthis drink should come with a warning because it\u2019s delicious and will lead to my cardiac arrest.\u201d  On its website, Panera refers to its Charged Lemonades as \u201cthe ultimate energy drink,\u201d although the lawsuit alleges that it was not advertised as such in-store at the time of Katz\u2019s death. It is not clear how long that description has been used on the site. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to market it that way and know it\u2019s energy drink, how can you not market it that way in the actual store?\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThe reasonable consumer is not going to go onto the website to compare it to see whether or not there\u2019s any additional information.\u201d Katz\u2019s parents, who declined to speak about the lawsuit, are desperate for people to understand exactly what is in Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade before they buy it, Crawford said. \u201cThat has become their most important thing, is making the public aware of these dangers to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to someone else,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Mediterranean diet may reduce or prevent PTSD symptoms, new research shows",
        "content": "A Mediterranean diet that's rich in vegetables, fruits and fish may help reduce or stave off symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to research published this week in the journal Nature Mental Health. The peer-reviewed findings are based on patient data from two studies \u2014 one in 2008 and another in 2013 \u2014 which collectively involved tens of thousands of female participants. The researchers behind those studies gathered stool samples, as well as information about the women's mental health and dietary habits. The findings could help inform dietary recommendations for people who are vulnerable to PTSD, such as those serving in the military, said Carol Shively, a pathology professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was not involved in the research. Shively\u2019s own research has shown that the Mediterranean diet protects against exaggerated stress responses in monkeys. \u201cWhen you put that in the context of PTSD, what\u2019s going to happen, I think, is that in response to overt stresses, if you\u2019re consuming a Mediterranean diet, you won\u2019t have these horrific stress responses that can be very damaging,\u201d Shively said. For the latest study, researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health selected 191 women from the earlier cohorts: 44 with PTSD symptoms, 119 who had experienced trauma but no PTSD symptoms and 28 who had experienced neither. Overall, women within that group who followed a Mediterranean diet \u2014 which includes fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, olive oil and fish \u2014 experienced fewer PTSD symptoms.  Plant-based foods in particular were negatively associated with PTSD symptoms, whereas red and processed meats were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. Around 4% of the world\u2019s population has had PTSD in their lifetimes. The disorder develops in certain people who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events such as severe injuries, violence or deaths, but researchers are still uncovering why. \"Many people get exposed to trauma, but only a small percentage go on to develop PTSD. It\u2019s always been a bit of a mystery,\" said Christopher Lowry, an associate professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who was not involved in the research. Diet could be an important part of that explanation, he said. The brain and the gastrointestinal system, or \"gut\" \u2014 which includes the stomach, intestines and colon \u2014 send signals back and forth through a complex system of nerves, hormones and chemicals. As a result, poor gut health has been linked to several mental illnesses, including anxiety and depression. A study last year also found signs of intestinal inflammation in people with PTSD. PTSD, in particular, has been linked to dysregulation in brain circuits that manage stress and fear responses. Studies have shown, for instance, that people with PTSD have hyperactive amygdalae, which are a region of the brain that helps process emotions. According to Yang-Yu Liu, the study\u2019s author, the gut microbiome \u2014 or the microorganisms, including bacteria, that live in the digestive tract \u2014 influences both the development and the response of the amygdala. \"That could be the reason why the gut microbiome is important for PTSD,\" said Liu, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and an associate scientist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Several components of the Mediterranean diet \u2014 such as fiber and omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 are known to support gut health, which in turn can influence brain function. In particular, Liu and his research team identified a species of gut bacteria that seemed linked to the Mediterranean diet and appeared to protect against PTSD symptoms. \u201cMaybe those enriched components of a Mediterranean diet help this particular bug thrive in the gut environment,\u201d Liu said. Lowry, however, said he is cautious about attributing any benefit to specific gut bacteria until additional studies replicate the results. He suspects that the Mediterranean diet may help alleviate or prevent PTSD systems largely by reducing inflammation. \u201cThe Mediterranean diet predominantly has an anti-inflammatory effect, and we have known for decades now that inflammation is a risk factor for depression,\" he said. \"Now it\u2019s become clear that it\u2019s also a risk factor for PTSD.\u201d Several studies have indeed suggested that elevated levels of inflammation may play a role in the development of PTSD. And Lowry\u2019s research in U.S. veterans has shown that anti-inflammatory probiotics have the potential to treat PTSD symptoms. The Mediterranean diet cuts out processed foods with lots of sugar and saturated or trans fats, which can be highly inflammatory, Lowry said. The human gut is semi-permeable, and researchers suspect that processed foods can increase its leakiness, which allows gut bacteria to enter the bloodstream. That process drives inflammation that can travel from the blood to the central nervous system and have a wide influence on brain function. Shively said any diet that's high in fiber, fresh fruits, vegetables and plant-based fats and proteins should have the opposite effect. \u201cThere are so many reasons not to eat Western diet and so many reasons to eat a healthier diet,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve just added brain and mental health to the pile.\u201d Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Tainted water and viruses put Gaza residents, especially kids, at further risk",
        "content": "Clean drinking water is running out in Gaza, furthering an already catastrophic situation. After Hamas' surprise terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,400 people, Israel cut off water, electricity and fuel to the Gaza Strip in retaliation. \"If we look at the issue of water \u2014 we all know water is life \u2014 Gaza is running out of water, and Gaza is running out of life,\" Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said in a statement last weekend.  Dr. Adam Levine, the chief of global emergency medicine at the Brown University Alpert Medical School and School of Public Health, said, \"We know that in other conflicts around the world, whether it be in Africa or the Middle East or South Asia, that infectious diseases actually kill more civilians than bombs or bullets.\" Follow live coverage from NBC News here. Infectious disease is a particular concern for people in Gaza, \"a population with decreased access to clean water and sanitation,\" Levine said, as well as \"a population that has been displaced and is sheltering together in very crowded conditions.\" Without clean water, Gazans are forced to drink or cook with tainted water. That water is likely to be rife with bacteria that can lead to violent intestinal diseases, such as dysentery and cholera. With cholera, \"you can become dehydrated and die in an incredibly short period of time,\" said Dr. Paul Spiegel, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. Most at risk, doctors said, are children, because they have much less blood volume compared to adults. \"In general, they're going to dehydrate faster than adults would,\" Levine said. An outbreak of cholera or other diarrheal diseases may have an especially widespread impact on Gaza's population, nearly half of which is ages 18 and younger, according to the U.N. \"The younger the child is, the more at risk they're going to be,\" Levine said. There are also signs that other illnesses \u2014 specifically, respiratory viruses \u2014 are beginning to spread as thousands of evacuees from northern Gaza are forced into cramped, crowded areas in the southern half of the territory. Dr. Ahmad Moghrabi, the head of plastic surgery at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said he has seen what he believes is a rise in the flu \"even among medical personnel,\" though tests aren't available. Spiegel said Covid is also expected to \"rear its head\" in Gaza. \"As people are moving from north to south, it's going to be more and more congested and more and more ripe for infectious diseases,\" he said. Widespread vaccination against flu or other viruses, such as RSV or Covid, is out of the question as the conflict continues. \"It's impossible,\" Moghrabi said. There is no evidence that measles is spreading, but it is a virus that concerns doctors. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. One case in a crowded shelter can infect anyone and everyone there who remains unvaccinated. While measles vaccination rates among children in Gaza were as high as 97% before 2020, Levine said, they dropped during the Covid pandemic. As a result, measles returned to Gaza in 2020 for the first time in decades. \"I would not be surprised if measles popped up\" again, said Dabney Evans, an associate professor of global health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and the director of Emory's Center for Humanitarian Emergencies. It has occurred \"in other situations where there's been massive displacements or movement of people.\" Measles vaccination, as well as shots to protect against flu, Covid and RSV, would be part of humanitarian aid if those workers and resources are allowed into Gaza. The World Health Organization said supplies it has sent to the region are on standby in Egypt at the Rafah crossing, which remained closed Friday. The lack of clean drinking water, food and sanitation among Gazans, Evans said, would worsen the health impact of any spread of viruses or bacterial illness. Dr. Barbara Zind, a Colorado pediatrician who traveled to Gaza City with the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund the Friday before the war began and is still there, estimated that 300 to 400 people are forced to share one toilet. \"They have no fuel or electricity or food or clean water,\" Zind said. \"This population is being killed.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "CDC says skin-disfiguring parasite may be endemic in Texas, present in other states",
        "content": "A parasite capable of causing a disfiguring skin disease may be endemic in Texas and present in other southern states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2005 to 2019, the CDC identified 1,222 cases in the U.S. that were positive for Leishmania, a parasite transmitted through the bites of infected female sandflies. The parasite can cause a disease called leishmaniasis, which usually results in skin sores that develop within a few weeks or months after a bite. Leishmaniasis cases in the U.S. are typically found in people who traveled outside the country to tropical or subtropical climates \u2014 particularly those in the Middle East, central Asia, northern Africa and Latin America.  But the CDC said 86 of the Leishmania samples were from people with no recent history of travel outside the U.S. The researchers also detected a unique strain of Leishmania that appeared to be genetically distinct from travel-related cases, suggesting it was spreading locally in the U.S. \"We cannot say that it is exclusive to Texas, but from the samples that were submitted to CDC, the majority were from Texas,\" said Vitaliano Cama, a senior adviser with CDC\u2019s Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, who conducted the research. The CDC researchers presented the data this week at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Chicago. Dr. Mary Kamb, a CDC epidemiologist also involved in the research, said the findings are mostly relevant to healthcare providers and don't suggest a serious public health risk. \u201cWe need to increase the awareness among clinicians, dermatologists, infectious disease doctors or general practitioners,\" she said. In addition to the Texas cases, Kamb said, the CDC has received anecdotal reports of locally acquired leishmaniasis in Florida, but the cases haven't been confirmed yet. Occasional cases have also been detected in Oklahoma and Arizona. \u201cOur understanding of leishmaniasis acquired in the U.S. is still really evolving,\u201d said Joshua Lieberman, assistant director of the molecular microbiology clinical laboratory at UW Medicine, who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me whether the true rate of new infections is increasing or we\u2019re just getting better at detecting it, or both.\" Leishmania remains uncommon in the U.S., he added. \u201cFor the general public, if you\u2019re not traveling to endemic areas, your risk is vanishingly small,\u201d Lieberman said. However, both Lieberman and Kamb noted that some cases may go undetected without proper surveillance. Kamb said sandflies are found in several southern states, and many parts of the U.S. have warm temperatures and woodland or forested areas that could support the insect populations. But Texas is the only state that requires health professionals to report leishmaniasis cases to its health department, and there is no national requirement to report the disease to the CDC. \"For states outside Texas, it might be useful to consider making leishmaniasis reportable, but we don\u2019t have very much data from other states suggesting this is a problem,\u201d Kamb said. Lieberman said nearly all locally acquired leishmaniasis cases in the U.S. belong to a species called Leishmania mexicana, which produces skin lesions that often start out as tiny, painless bumps and may develop into ulcers. The lesions frequently disappear on their own and may not require treatment, Lieberman said \u2014 though doctors can prescribe topical therapies if needed. The strain identified in this week's CDC presentation is a version of Leishmania mexicana, meaning cases should be relatively mild. A different parasite, Leishmania infantum, can cause a more severe form of leishmaniasis that travels to internal organs and results in 20,000 to 30,000 deaths globally each year, according to the World Health Organization. Sandflies pick up the parasite by feeding on infected dogs, so researchers worry about Leishmania infantum spreading in the U.S. via dogs imported from other countries. Lieberman said treatment is available for severe cases as well, but the medications can be difficult for people to tolerate. \u201cThe good news is treatment is going to be much more mild for the disease type that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S,. but for returning travelers who may have more severe disease or other types of infections that go to organs or go to the insides of the nose and the mouth, those can require toxic drugs,\" he said. Though the risk of leishmaniasis in the U.S. is low, people can take measures to avoid getting bitten by sandflies, Kamb said. \"It's the usual things you do to avoid insect bites,\" she said. \"If you're walking in the woods or hiking, wear long pants or long-sleeve shirts and use insect repellent.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Supreme Court blocks restrictions on Biden administration efforts to get platforms to remove social media posts",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday blocked in full a lower court ruling that would have curbed the Biden administration's ability to communicate with social media companies about contentious content on such issues as Covid-19. The decision in a short unsigned order puts on hold a Louisiana-based judge's ruling in July that specific agencies and officials should be barred from meeting with companies to discuss whether certain content should be stifled. The Supreme Court also agreed to immediately take up the government's appeal, meaning it will hear arguments and issue a ruling on the merits in its current term, which runs until the end of June. Three conservative justices noted that they would have denied the application: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. \"At this time in the history of our country, what the court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news. That is most unfortunate,\" Alito wrote in a dissenting opinion. GOP attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri, along with five social media users, filed the underlying lawsuit, alleging that U.S. government officials went too far in what they characterize as coercion of social media companies to address posts, especially those related to Covid-19. The individual plaintiffs include Covid-19 lockdown opponents and Jim Hoft, the owner of the right-wing website Gateway Pundit. They claim that the government\u2019s actions violated free speech protections under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment. \"This is the worst First Amendment violation in our nation's history. We look forward to dismantling Joe Biden's vast censorship enterprise at the nation's highest court,\" Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement Friday. A spokesman for the Department of Justice in Washington declined to comment. The lawsuit makes various claims relating to activities that occurred in 2020 and before, including efforts to deter the spread of false information about Covid-19 and the presidential election. Donald Trump was president at the time, but the district court ruling focused on actions taken by the government after President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. Judge Terry Doughty, who was appointed by Trump, barred officials from \u201ccommunication of any kind with social-media companies urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.\u201d The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently narrowed the scope of Doughty\u2019s injunction. But the appeals court still required the White House, the FBI and top health officials not to \u201ccoerce or significantly encourage\u201d social media companies to remove content the Biden administration considers misinformation. Affected officials would have included White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The administration turned to the Supreme Court hoping to freeze Doughty's ruling in full. The district court ruling was on hold while the Supreme Court decided what steps to take. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers that Doughty's decision was \u201can unprecedented injunction\u201d that \u201cflouts bedrock principles\" of federal law. \u201cThe court imposed unprecedented limits on the ability of the President\u2019s closest aides to use the bully pulpit to address matters of public concern, on the FBI\u2019s ability to address threats to the Nation\u2019s security, and on the CDC\u2019s ability to relay public health information at platforms\u2019 request,\" she added. Prelogar argued that the original injunction is \u201cvastly overbroad,\u201d saying \u201cit covers thousands of federal officers and employees, and it applies to communications with and about all social media platforms\u201d regarding content moderation on such topics as national security and criminal matters. Lawyers for the states and plaintiffs said in court papers that the lower courts had both found \"egregious, systematic First Amendment violations\" by the government when officials put pressure on the companies to \"censor disfavored viewpoints.\" Lawrence Hurley covers the Supreme Court for NBC News.

        "title": "'Toddler milks' promoted on TikTok are unregulated and unnecessary, pediatrician group says",
        "content": "Powdered drink mixes that are widely promoted as \u201ctoddler milks\u201d for older babies and children up to age 3 are unregulated, unnecessary and \u201cnutritionally incomplete,\u201d the American Academy of Pediatrics warned Friday. The drinks, which are touted to parents on TikTok, in television ads and on other sites, often contain added sugar and salt. The manufacturers make unproven claims that the drinks boost kids\u2019 brains or immune systems, said Dr. George Fuchs, a member of the AAP\u2019s nutrition committee, which released the new report. Formula industry officials said the drinks could be useful for filling \u201cnutrition gaps\u201d in kids\u2019 diets. But Fuchs said older babies and toddlers should be given a balanced diet of solid foods, as well as drink breast milk, fortified whole cow\u2019s milk and water after age 1. Here is what else you should know about so-called toddler milks: The powdered milk mixes are sold in cans and made to be mixed with water. They are often produced by the makers of top brands of infant formulas, packaged with similar labels and sold in the same store aisles. The products are typically marketed for babies older than 6 to 12 months and preschoolers up to age 3 as nutritious drinks for the next stage of development. Yes. Infant formula is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and must meet certain nutrition requirements as a replacement for human milk for babies up to 12 months. The facilities where infant formula are made are regularly inspected. There are no federal regulations governing milk drink mixes for older babies and toddlers. Also, toddler drinks are different than medical formulas prescribed for specific conditions, such as heart disease or problems digesting certain foods. Fuchs and other experts point to the lack of common standards for toddler milks, which means the ingredients vary widely among brands. Most contain added sugar and are targeted toward children who are at the age when they could develop a lasting taste for sweets, possibly leading to obesity and other diseases. \u201cIt could be called the gateway sugary drink,\u201d said Frances Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives and a research professor with the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health at the University of Connecticut. The toddler milks are also more expensive than cow\u2019s milk, experts said. \u201cThey\u2019re not only not as good as cow\u2019s milk and a balanced diet, they\u2019re worse,\u201d said Fuchs, a pediatrics professor at the University of Kentucky. Toddler milks are widely advertised, and sales have soared in recent years, from $39 million in 2006 to $92 million in 2015, according to a 2020 study. Fleming-Milici said companies promote these products in a way that may lead parents to believe the drinks are nutritionally necessary. \u201cThey look a lot like infant formula,\u201d she said. \u201cParents really trust the formula they use for their children.\u201d In one study, 60% of caregivers of toddlers said they believed the drinks provided nutrition that the children wouldn\u2019t get from other foods. Toddler milks are labeled explicitly for children older than 12 months and \u201ccan contribute to nutritional intake and potentially fill nutrition gaps,\u201d according to the Infant Nutrition Council of America. The trade group\u2019s members are top manufacturers of formula and toddler drinks, including Abbott Nutrition, Perrigo Nutrition and Reckitt. Families and health care providers should be better educated on toddler milks, which \u201chave no specific role in routine care of healthy children,\u201d the AAP said. The group also wants requirements to ensure the products are not linked to regulated infant formula or sold next to formula. A health group petitioned the FDA in 2020 to regulate toddler milks, but the agency is still reviewing the request. Families who want to ensure older babies and toddlers are getting the nutrition they need should rely on fortified grains and milks, protein and fruits and vegetables, Fuchs said. ",

        "title": "Pediatricians are sounding the alarm on three products landing kids in the ER",
        "content": "Pediatricians are sounding the alarm about three products that have been increasingly or frequently landing kids in the emergency room. According to research being presented this weekend at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference, children are getting burned by hair styling tools, swallowing tiny magnets found in desk toys and injuring themselves on electric scooters. The researchers called on parents, schools and regulators to help reduce those risks. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children in the U.S., and some of those deaths \"stem from things in the household that potentially could be hazardous,\u201d said Dr. Brandon Rozanski, a pediatric resident at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu. The products highlighted in the new research, of course, aren't the only ones that pose threats. Nursing pillows, loungers and rockers have also been associated with suffocation in infants, while water beads and coin or button batteries can be life-threatening if kids ingest them. \"Unfortunately, there are a few products that unto themselves pose a danger to a child,\" said Dr. Leah Middelberg, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Middelberg's research highlights the dangers of small, round high-powered magnets \u2014 also known as \u201crare-earth magnets\" \u2014 often sold as desk toys. Fidgeting with the balls or beads is said to help relieve stress in adults, but children can accidentally swallow them or insert them into their noses or ears. \"They come in tens to hundreds in these little sets, where easily a couple can come free and be trapped in the carpet and a kiddo can pick them up,\" Middelberg said. Doctors worry especially about children\u2019s ingesting more than one magnet, because two can strongly attract and pinch body tissue. That, in turn, can cause internal bleeding, twisting or blockages in the intestines, infection or death. High-powered magnets are \"definitely up there with things that I worry a lot about kiddos getting ahold of,\" Middelberg said. Her research, based on data from 25 U.S. children\u2019s hospitals from 2017 to 2019, identified nearly 600 cases in which people ages 21 or younger swallowed high-powered magnets or inserted them into their noses or ears. Nearly half required a procedure like surgery or an endoscopy, Middelberg said. Kari Schuttler Vicario said her son, Brody Franzen, accidentally swallowed two high-powered magnets at school more than three years ago, when he was in the sixth grade. \"There were two little circular ones that he was trying to put on the top and bottom of the tip of his tongue,\" Vicario said. \"They slipped off the tip and connected together, and then he, out of shock, just swallowed them.\" Franzen reported the incident to the school nurse, she said. They went to the hospital, where doctors put a tube down Brody's throat and a camera into his stomach to retrieve the magnets. He spent the night in the hospital but made a full recovery. \"If he wouldn't have said something as soon as he did or waited a day, it could have been much worse,\" Vicario said. Middelberg said there has been a \u201chuge increase\u201d in magnet-related injuries and calls to U.S. poison centers since 2017. The previous year, a federal appeals court overturned a mandate from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission that required magnet sets to be too large to swallow or too weak to cause internal injuries. The commission passed a new mandate last year with similar requirements, which remains in place, but Middelberg said researchers aren't yet sure whether injuries have declined as a result. \"We hope injuries and exposures will go down like they did the last time the rule set was in place,\" she said. Electric hair styling tools can send kids to the emergency room, Rozanski said, because touching them accidentally can lead to first- or second-degree burns. Curling irons and hair straighteners can reach temperatures as high as 450 degrees Fahrenheit within minutes of being plugged in. Rozanski's research, which drew upon data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, estimated that there were 31,000 burn injuries from hair styling tools among people ages 24 and younger from 2013 to 2022. Most of the people injured were age 10 or younger, and the vast majority didn\u2019t need to be admitted to the hospital; however, Rozanski estimated that more than 1,000 of the incidents resulted in emergency department visits. \u201cDevelopmentally, kids under 10, they\u2019re going to be curious, they\u2019re going to be reaching things. They don\u2019t necessarily have the learned skill of \u2018Hey, that might be dangerous. That\u2019s hot,\u2019\u201d Rozanski said. He recommended that parents keep electric hair stylers out of kids\u2019 reach until they become teenagers. As electric scooters have become popular, they have also led to more injuries, according to research from Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP. From 2020 to 2021, researchers found, the number of children and teens injured on electric scooters rose 71% in the U.S. Emergency departments reported more than 13,500 such injuries over the two-year period, frequently among boys ages 16 to 18. Head injuries like fractures were the most common type, the researchers found. Nearly 67% of children who sustained head injuries from electric scooters weren\u2019t wearing helmets. Some scooter injuries involved car accidents, while others came after riders hit potholes or uneven ground.   Over the summer, 16-year-old Anthony Greco hit a pothole in the road riding his electric scooter home from work. \"The scooter started to lose control, and I felt like I was going to fall off. I tried to hop off and save myself, and then I landed right on my ankle, and it just snapped,\" he said. Anthony fractured his leg and sought care at CHOP. The wound was so severe and dirty that doctors considered amputation, but they were able to perform reconstructive surgery. \"His father is an above-the-knee amputee, so we already live that life. To have that for our son, too, that was a really scary thought,\" said his mother, Krystine Greco. Dr. J. Todd Lawrence, the pediatric orthopedic surgeon who treated Anthony at CHOP and oversaw the research, said many kids visit the emergency room for similar circumstances. But the majority of electric scooter injuries are \"little bumps and bruises, things that are fairly easily treated,\" he said. To prevent injuries, the researchers suggested adding more bicycle and scooter lanes in suburban and urban areas, teaching kids safe riding practices and educating drivers about maintaining safe distances from scooters. Lawrence said parents should also consider buying scooters with sizes and speeds that are appropriate for their teenagers. \"If you\u2019re going to have your 15-year-old teenage boy riding it, they don\u2019t need one that goes 55 miles per hour,\" he said. According to the Greco family, however, kids shouldn't be riding electric scooters at all. \u201cIf I see somebody on an electric scooter, I think to myself, \u2018How can you even be doing that right now?'\" Anthony said. \"I see all of the casualties that can happen while they're on it.\" Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Attacks on health care facilities have increased in past decade, human rights groups say",
        "content": "Hospitals are supposed to be safe havens during times of war, but attacks against hospitals and health care facilities in conflict zones are becoming more common worldwide, human rights experts say.  During the first week of the war between Israel and Hamas, there were 94 attacks on health care facilities in Israel and Gaza, which killed 29 health care workers and injured 24, according to the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition, or SHCC, a human rights advocacy group.   \u201cThe number of attacks or incidents of violence on health care facilities in this conflict are very significant,\u201d said Leonard Rubenstein, a human rights attorney and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the circumstances of the attacks and why they were attacked, but the patterns are disturbing.\u201d Follow live coverage from NBC News here. The coalition\u2019s numbers don\u2019t reflect Tuesday\u2019s explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. The cause of that blast is still unclear, but human rights experts say that even if the cause was a misfired rocket by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization \u2014 designated a terrorist group by the U.S. \u2014 rather than an Israeli airstrike, it would still be a violation of humanitarian law. U.S. officials have said a misfired rocket is the most likely cause, while Palestinian officials and Hamas blame Israel. \u201cIf this was a misfire, then you shouldn\u2019t be firing rockets whose flight path goes over a hospital,\u201d said Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights. Experts fear these incidents in Israel and Gaza are part of a concerning trend that\u2019s been increasing over the last 10 years.  \u201cBetween Syria, Ukraine and Gaza, there is a sense that we have seen an unprecedented number of attacks on health care facilities, health care providers and ambulances,\u201d Zarifi said. Across the world, there were nearly 2,000 incidents of violence against health care facilities last year, a 45% increase from the year before, according to a SHCC report. Most of them were in Ukraine and Myanmar, a country that has been shrouded in violence for years. \u201cThis is very serious,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cThe consequences to the population are devastating.\u201d Attacking a health care facility like a hospital is a violation of international humanitarian law, a set of rules designed to limit the effects of war, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The goal of the rules is to protect people who are not or no longer involved in conflict. Much of the law is contained in the Geneva Conventions, which most countries and states have agreed to abide by. Rubenstein, who has studied this issue for the last 25 years, said that for a long time, militaries followed these laws and made sure health care was protected. But as political climates have changed in some places, so have military tactics. \u201cThere seems to be less attention to obligations to protect health care,\u201d he said. That includes where airstrikes happen and bombs land, said Tim Bishop, project coordinator with Insecurity Insight, a humanitarian group, and one of the authors of the coalition report. He said some areas, such as Ukrainian cities and Gaza, are densely populated, so an explosive that\u2019s meant for a different target can end up being too close to a health care facility. But that\u2019s still a violation of humanitarian law, said Rubenstein. Militaries are obligated to take precautions to protect hospitals and health care facilities. \u201cIn Gaza, so many people are crowded into a populated area, you can\u2019t easily distinguish between civilians and military targets,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThis is why use of these weapons in these areas is concerning.\u201d  Despite the mounting documented attacks, few, if any, have been prosecuted.  \u201cThe problem is that there has been almost absolute impunity for these attacks,\u201d Zarifi said. \u201cLooking at Ukraine, looking at Syria, going back into Yemen, all of the conflicts we\u2019ve documented, no one has been prosecuted, although it is a clear war crime.\u201d Zarifi said the government of the offending military has the primary responsibility for prosecuting these cases.  \u201cThe first port of call is the governments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad guys will rarely do that. So, the second port of call is, where possible, its international bodies. For instance, in Ukraine, the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction.\u201d  Zarifi said that court is now looking into attacks in the Ukraine because there have been so many. The coalition documented 1,000 attacks on health care there last year. That same court also has jurisdiction in Gaza. \u201cHaving the possibility for accountability at least helps prevent future atrocities,\u201d Zarifi said. \u201cAnd by accountability, I don\u2019t just mean responding to atrocities with atrocities.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "content": "U.S. pharmacy chain CVS Health said on Thursday it is pulling some of the most common decongestants with phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from its shelves and will no longer sell them. The move comes after a panel of advisers to U.S. health regulators raised doubts over the efficacy of the ingredient. Last month, the panel refused to back the effectiveness of oral over-the-counter medicines made with phenylephrine, adding that no more trials were required to prove otherwise. CVS said \u201cother oral cough and cold products will continue to be offered to meet consumer needs.\u201d Phenylephrine was substituted for pseudoephedrine in many non-prescription cold and allergy medicines after the latter was restricted amid reports of abuse.

        "title": "HBCUs are behind the effort to study the genetic variants that affect Black people",
        "content": "Scientists are setting out to collect genetic material from 500,000 people of African ancestry to create what they believe will be the world\u2019s largest database of genomic information from the population. The hope is to build a new \u201creference genome\u201d \u2014 a template to compare to full sets of DNA from individuals \u2014 and better understand genetic variants that affect Black people. It could eventually translate into new medicines and diagnostic tests \u2014 and help reduce health disparities. The initiative was launched Wednesday by Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, as well as Regeneron Genetics Center, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and Roche. The pharmaceutical companies are providing the funding, while the data will be managed by a nonprofit started by Meharry, called the Diaspora Human Genomics Institute. Organizers said there\u2019s a clear need for the project, pointing to research showing that less than 2% of genetic information being studied today comes from people of African ancestry. \u201cWe are going to bridge that gap, and this is just the beginning,\u201d said Anil Shanker, senior vice president for research and innovation at Meharry. Scientists have long known that the reference they compare to individual genomes has serious limits because it mostly relies on genetic material from one man and doesn\u2019t reflect the spectrum of human diversity. Although any two people\u2019s genomes \u2014 that is, a set of instructions to build and sustain a human being \u2014 are more than 99% identical, scientists say they want to understand the differences. The project is not connected with related research already underway. In May, scientists published four studies about building a diverse reference genome that they call a \u201cpangenome.\u201d At that point, it included the genetic material of 24 people of African ancestry, 16 from the Americas and the Caribbean, six from Asia and one from Europe. In the new project, Meharry, a historically Black academic health sciences center, will recruit patients from the Nashville area to donate blood, then send it to the Regeneron Genetics Center, which will do the genetic sequencing for free. Other historically Black colleges and universities in the U.S., and the University of Zambia in Africa, will also recruit volunteers. Project organizers said they are also open to working with other universities in Africa, as well as medical centers and health departments there. Organizers expect enrollment to take about five years. All information will be kept anonymous. After the genetic sequencing, the data will go into a repository at the Diaspora Human Genomics Institute, and the database will be provided exclusively to HBCUs and the institutions involved in Africa. Outside researchers can access the information through those institutions. \u201cYou can imagine if these schools have such a resource, other academic institutions are going to want to collaborate with them,\u201d said Lyndon Mitnaul, executive director for research initiatives at Regeneron Genetics Center. Corporate partners will be able to use the data for research and to develop medicines and diagnostic tests. The 10-year initiative also involves establishing a grant program to support research and education in genomics and related fields at Meharry, plus broader STEM programs for grade-school children in diverse communities. Each of the pharmaceutical companies involved intends to contribute $20 million toward the genetic and educational parts of the effort. ",

Retton had been \"going on the up and up\" this week, with loved ones \"seeing so much progress\" as she fights a rare form of pneumonia, her daughter Shayla Kelley Schrepfer told Instagram followers. \"But then yesterday we had a pretty scary setback,\" Schrepfer continued. \"She is still in ICU and we're just working through some things as far as her setback goes.\" The medical ups and downs have taken a toll on Retton, 55. \"She had a better day today, which is great, [she's] just really, really exhausted,\" Schrepfer added. \"She is really exhausted.\" Retton is best known for winning the individual all-around gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She also won silver in the vault and the team all-around and bronze in the uneven bars and the floor exercise. Her performances captured America's imagination and cemented her fame as one the country's most famous gymnasts. She was the first female athlete depicted on a Wheaties box. Her family thanked fans for all of their well-wishes. \"Thank you guys again for the support,\" Schrepfer said. \"I'm getting so many messages and emails and it's so great to see people love on her.\" Retton lives in the Houston area. The hospital where she's being treated hasn't been publicly disclosed.

        "title": "Viral TikTok underscores the need for frank conversations about STIs",
        "content": "Sophie Miller felt like she had no one to talk to after she was diagnosed with herpes last week \u2014 so she turned to TikTok.  In a candid video posted to her secondary \u201cburner\u201d account on Oct. 11, Miller, 21, who lives in Detroit, stitched together video to document her experience of the process. The video starts with her describing her symptoms \u2014 a burning sensation after urinating, a swollen lymph node in her groin, sores on her genitals \u2014 before she went to the doctor. Then she describes her anxiety ahead of the appointment and finally cries on camera as she shares the news of her diagnosis.   The response was overwhelming \u2014 more than 7.2 million people had seen the video as of Wednesday afternoon. Many commenters shared their own stories in solidarity. Other people expressed gratitude for Miller\u2019s openness, given the embarrassment they\u2019d felt after their diagnoses.  \u201cI\u2019ve had so many people reaching out to me and telling me their stories and thanking me,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd I just was not expecting that. \u2026 It\u2019s just been very helpful for me and I\u2019m sure for others who have just been diagnosed, as well as diagnosed in the past.\u201d The popularity of Miller\u2019s video suggests a demand for frank conversations about sexually transmitted infections online, particularly from sexual health advocates and people living with viruses like herpes. In recent years, TikTok has become a place for many health educators  \u2014 from doctors to sex therapists \u2014 to facilitate more positive conversations around sex. Talking about sexually transmitted diseases and infections can help reduce stigma and increase awareness, some experts say.   A spokesperson for TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the brave people who get out there in front and just say \u2018I\u2019m going to talk about this\u2019 who break down those barriers and those stigmas,\u201d said Dr. Keith Jerome, a virologist who researches herpes at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.  Speaking out about one\u2019s experience with the virus can open the door for others to do so, too, he added, and a critical mass of voices can then put pressure on governments and health organizations to fund research. Herpes is both common and treatable. More than 3.7 billion people worldwide under age 50 have herpes simplex virus type 1, the virus Miller was diagnosed with, according to the World Health Organization. That\u2019s roughly 67% of the population in that age group. Another 491 million people ages 15 to 49 have HSV-type 2, which mainly causes genital herpes, WHO data shows. \u201cSilence around the topic and avoiding testing harms both physical, mental and emotional health,\u201d Planned Parenthood says in a blog post. That\u2019s in part why Miller decided to go public. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to talk to strangers on a screen than in person or talking to your friends about it,\u201d she said.  Miller said the comments on her video comforted her \u2014 and educated her further. Some of her followers who also have herpes shared steps she can take to reduce her transmission rate. Others just offered support.  \u201cHey girl.. I was diagnosed 8 years ago at the ripe age of 18 -thought my life was over, but that\u2019s not the case. Reach out if you ever need to talk,\u201d a commenter wrote. Another wrote: \u201cI have herpes as well and I was terrified. I didn\u2019t know what it would mean moving forward. I\u2019ve had it about 4 years and only had a few outbreaks.\u201d Miller said she hopes to see more open conversations about sexual health so others who are struggling with a diagnosis know they\u2019re not alone.  \u201cI have an STD,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t feel like the end of the world.\u201d Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "title": "Pfizer to price Covid drug Paxlovid at $1,390 per course",
        "content": "Pfizer will price a five-day course of its Covid antiviral drug Paxlovid at $1,390 when the company starts to transition it to the commercial market later this year. A company spokesperson on Wednesday confirmed the price, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. That list price, which is before rebates and other discounts to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, is more than double the $529 the federal government paid for Paxlovid. The government has purchased and distributed Paxlovid to the public for free since December 2021, when the FDA first authorized the treatment. But beginning in 2024, Pfizer will sell Paxlovid directly to health insurers, which comes as demand for Covid vaccines and treatments slumps nationwide. Doctors, health experts and patient advocates have raised concerns that a higher price will curb access to the life-saving treatment, which has been shown to reduce the risk of severe disease and death from Covid among vulnerable patients, such as those with diabetes, heart conditions or a weakened immune system.  But health insurance plans will likely pay much less than the nearly $1,400 list price for Paxlovid, meaning patients will probably have small or no out-of-pocket costs. Pfizer also noted that it is working with payers to lower copays for patients. Pfizer plans to subsidize copays of people who are commercially insured at least through 2028. \u201cAs always, Pfizer\u2019s goal is to ensure broad and equitable access to our medicines. We are working diligently with payers to achieve the best possible formulary placement for PAXLOVID, resulting in low OOP costs for patients,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to CNBC. On Friday, the company also said it expects revenue from Paxlovid to come in $7 billion lower than previously anticipated, partly due to the return of doses labeled for emergency use by the federal government. Overall, Pfizer now expects 2023 sales of $58 billion to $61 billion, down from its previous guidance of $67 billion to $70 billion. Pfizer said it cut its revenue outlook \u201csolely due to its Covid products.\u201d Annika Kim Constantino covers the biotech and pharmaceutical industry for CNBC Digital. ",

        "title": "FDA proposes ban on hair relaxers with formaldehyde",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde as an ingredient in hair relaxers, a huge step in raising awareness about the potential harms such products create for the many Black women who typically use them.  The proposed rule would ban the chemical in hair-smoothing or hair-straightening products, also called relaxers. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients, according to a fact sheet from the agency.  The FDA didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas that\u2019s used in a wide variety of household products, including medicines and cosmetics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s highly toxic, and repeated exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, lungs and throat. It is also linked to certain cancers, including myeloid leukemia, a cancer that occurs in the blood and bone marrow, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even products that don\u2019t contain formaldehyde as a main ingredient may contain other ingredients that, when heated, can be converted into formaldehyde, such as methylene glycol, which is found in some hair-straightening products. Some soaps, shampoos, lotions and cleaning products contain formalin, which is formaldehyde dissolved in water. The current law doesn\u2019t require the FDA to approve cosmetic products and ingredients before they go on the market \u2014 only color additives, according to the agency\u2019s website. Companies and people selling products have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products, the agency says, but federal law and regulations don\u2019t require companies to share their safety information with the FDA. Research in recent years has helped raise awareness about the potential dangers of using chemical hair relaxers. A study published last year by the National Institutes of Health found that women who used hair-straightening chemicals more than four times in the previous year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer compared to those who didn\u2019t use the products. While the study didn\u2019t collect information about specific brands or ingredients used by the participants, the researchers noted that formaldehyde, parabens and other ingredients found in chemical hair straighteners may contribute to the increased risk of uterine cancer.  Additional research published this month by Boston University\u2019s Black Women\u2019s Health Study \u2014 a long-running study, launched in 1995, that tracks the health of 59,000 Black women \u2014 found that postmenopausal Black women who used chemical hair straighteners long term had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. The study was designed to emphasize the dangers of chemical hair straighteners and help identify safer alternatives, said the study\u2019s lead author, Kimberly Bertrand, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. \u201cWe know that these products are very poorly regulated by the federal government in terms of what goes in there,\u201d Bertrand said. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at an ingredient label and know that it contains these endocrine disruptors. They don\u2019t list phthalates and parabens on the box \u2014 they say fragrance and preservative. So women don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re being exposed to.\u201d Endocrine disruptors are often found in chemical hair straighteners and can be absorbed into the body when the product is placed on the scalp, Bertrand said. The chemicals can interfere with the body\u2019s endocrine, or hormone, system, and they are linked to early onset of puberty, fibroid tumors and infertility, she said.  An additional study published by the American Journal of Epidemiology in March found that current and former use of chemical hair straighteners was associated with lower fertility in women.  Several Black women have sued Revlon, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and other cosmetic brands within the past year, alleging that the companies\u2019 hair-straightening products caused them to develop uterine cancer, breast cancer and other health complications. In other cases, women also claimed the products caused infertility.  The FDA\u2019s proposed ban comes months after Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, wrote an open letter in March asking the federal agency to investigate to determine whether chemical hair straighteners contain carcinogens that lead to a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. Many Black women use such hair-straightening products to adapt to societal standards as a result of anti-Black hair sentiment, the letter said.  Black women have used hair relaxers for social and economic advancement, and should be able to \u201cshow up in the world\u201d without putting their health at risk, Pressley told NBC News in a statement. \u201cI applaud the FDA for being responsive to my and Congresswoman Brown\u2019s calls to ban harmful chemicals in hair straighteners and relaxers,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cThe public health \u2014 especially that of Black women \u2014 is at stake, which is why the Administration must finalize and implement this rule without delay.\u201d In addition to the FDA's proposed ban, Pressley and other advocates have pushed for policies like the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, known as the CROWN Act, which prohibits employment and educational discrimination based on hair texture. Since the U.S. House passed the bill in March 2022, more than 20 states have followed suit, including Texas, where a Black teenager was suspended this year after school officials said his dreadlocks violated the district\u2019s dress code. The target date for the FDA\u2019s proposed ban is April.  Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.  Claretta Bellamy is a fellow for NBC News. ",

        "title": "What Black women should know about hair relaxers and their health",
        "content": "The damage chemical hair relaxers can have on Black women is coming under intense scrutiny.  Several landmark studies have been published in the last year highlighting the link between chemical hair relaxers \u2014 which break down proteins in hair to straighten it \u2014 and increased rates of uterine cancer. And last week, after pressure from Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Shontel Brown of Ohio, the Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on hair-smoothing and hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde, an ingredient known to cause cancer.  As more research continues to reveal potential dangers, hundreds of Black people have filed lawsuits against big-name beauty and cosmetic retailers like L\u2019Oreal and Revlon, blaming their chemical hair straighteners as causes of uterine cancer, fibroid tumors and infertility.  The latest research on the effects of hair relaxers was published Oct. 10 by Boston University. According to the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, or BWHS, postmenopausal Black women who have used chemical hair relaxers more than twice a year or for more than five years have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer.   In following 44,798 Black women for up to 22 years, researchers found a higher rate of uterine cancer among postmenopausal Black women who reported having used chemical hair relaxers for at least 10 years, regardless of frequency.  Better grasping Black health and the factors that contribute to racial disparities in cancer was the intent behind the 22-year study.  \u201cThe idea here is that a renewed emphasis or attention to the potential dangers of these products, I hope, will spur policies, and that will sort of help reduce exposure in this population or even help us identify potentially safer alternatives to straighten hair,\u201d said the lead author of the study, Kimberly Bertrand, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. Revealing the potential risks of hair relaxers, she said, can help spread awareness and encourage making safer choices. To Rep. Pressley, oversight into these ingredients touches upon generational issue that Black women have long grappled with. \u201cFor generations, systemic racism and anti-Black hair sentiment have forced Black women to navigate the extreme politicization of hair,\u201d she said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this play out in schools and in the workplace, where Black folks have been criminalized, punished, or overlooked in personnel decisions just for how our hair grows out of our head. As a result, Black women have turned to straightened or relaxed hair as an attempt to advance socially and economically. But regardless of how we wear our hair, we should be able to show up in the world without putting our health at risk, and manufacturers should be prevented from making a profit at the expense of our health.\" NBC News spoke to Bertrand and other researchers to answer some questions Black people may have about chemical hair straighteners and the potential risks to their health Several studies have found that chemical hair straighteners have harmful effects on the body. Last year, the National Institutes of Health published a major study linking chemical hair straighteners to a higher risk of uterine cancer. The study analyzed data from 33,497 U.S. women ages 35 to 74 who were followed for nearly 11 years. During that period, 378 cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed. According to this month\u2019s BWHS, women who reported using hair relaxers more than twice a year or who used them for more than five years had a greater than 50% risk of developing uterine cancer compared to those who rarely or never used relaxers, additional data from the study shows.  In 2021, the BWHS found that Black women who used hair products containing lye, an ingredient typically found in salon relaxers, at least seven times a year for more than 15 years had a 30% increased risk of developing breast cancer. Among the 50,543 women who participated in the 25-year study, 2,311 participants had developed breast cancer, including 1,843 who developed invasive breast cancers, meaning the cancers spread into surrounding breast tissue. While Black women have a 4% lower incidence rate of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a 40% higher breast cancer death rate, according to the American Cancer Society. Other studies have shown that hair relaxers can cause fibroids and an early onset of puberty in girls, Bertrand said. Early puberty can increase the risk for metabolic syndromes such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Chemical hair relaxers contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can disrupt the functions of the endocrine system (which includes the thyroid, ovaries, pancreas and adrenal glands) and affect hormone levels. These chemicals include phthalates and parabens, which can be found in relaxers. People can be exposed to them by absorption through the skin or inhaling them in the air.  Black women are often exposed to endocrine disruptors by using relaxers, which are applied on the scalp, said Jasmine Abrams, a research scientist at the Yale University School of Public Health. \u201cIf you have ever gotten a relaxer, you know it usually sits on for a little bit, and most people sort of alert their hair stylist that it needs to be washed out once it starts tingling or burning \u2014 and at that point, you are running the risk of burns,\u201d said Abrams, one of the authors of a study this year linking chemical hair straighteners to issues with fertility. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re running the risk of burns or any sort of injury with that type of chemical,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re definitely increasing your risk for absorption. If you do that over time for many, many years, then it can, of course, become continuously problematic.\u201d Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can also be found in some beauty products like lotions, body washes and perfumes, she added.  Parabens, phthalates and other chemicals that are often found in chemical hair straighteners pose a greater risk than other products because of scalp exposure, Bertrand said. Even other chemical hair straighteners marketed as safer to use, including no-lye relaxers, still pose potential risks. \u201cIn our study, women who reported using non-lye relaxers were pretty much just as likely to report scalp burns as those who use lye relaxer,\u201d she said.  Hair-straightening products are \u201cvery poorly regulated\u201d by the federal government, Bertrand said, and many mask harmful chemicals under names such as \u201cfragrance and preservatives, so women don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re being exposed to.\u201d U.S. law does not require the Food and Drug Administration to approve cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives, before they go on the market, according to the FDA website. However, the FDA announced last week that it would propose a ban on hair-straightening and hair-smoothing products containing formaldehyde. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stricter regulations of ingredients in cosmetic products and using alternative methods like heat straightening may help reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, Bertrand said. In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, Pressley applauded the FDA, saying the public health of Black women \u201cis at stake.\u201d Researchers are not entirely sure.  \u201cWe can\u2019t definitively say that occasional use is entirely safe,\u201d said Abrams, an author of the 2023 study about hair relaxers and infertility. \u201cOur data essentially suggests that less frequent use is associated with lower risks when compared to regular prolonged use.\u201d In Abrams\u2019 study \u2014 which included women of different races ages 21 to 45 \u2014 Black women accounted for the greatest population of people who had started using relaxers at age 10 or younger. More than 50% of the Black participants in the study also had used hair relaxers before they reached age 10. Bertrand\u2019s study found that postmenopausal Black women had a greater risk of developing uterine cancer if they used hair relaxers more than twice a year or consistently for more than five years.  Other factors put Black women at risk for developing uterine cancer, including age, obesity and family and reproductive history, Bertrand added. There are no proven screening mechanisms to detect uterine cancer in the general population, as there are with other diseases like breast cancer, Bertrand said.  Women should visit their doctors if they have any symptoms of pain in the pelvic area or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Those with family histories of uterine cancer can also speak to their doctors about genetic testing to identify potential higher risks for certain cancers.  In terms of monitoring reproductive health, Abrams said, women can monitor their hormone levels \u2014 either by visiting endocrinologists or mailing in their biospecimens to labs \u2014 and speak with gynecologists about their concerns and ask about taking fertility assessments. In working on an upcoming study on Black women and infertility, she said, many of her participants have described challenges in getting treatment or being heard by their health providers. \u201cOne of our participants said, \u2018I felt like the goal among providers has always been to figure out how to keep Black women from getting pregnant, not to help them figure out how to get pregnant,\u2019\u201d Abrams said. \u201cSo she felt like, when she expressed these concerns about her fertility to her provider, she wasn\u2019t taken seriously.\u201d Many Black women have consulted with attorneys to sue Revlon, Just for Me and other cosmetics companies, alleging their hair straighteners cause cancer, fibroids and other health problems. Strength of Nature, LLC, which owns Just for Me, declined to comment. Larry Taylor Jr., an attorney at The Cochran Firm in Dallas, said thousands of women from their 20s to their 50s have filed suits alleging they developed ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers from using hair relaxers.  Revlon declined to comment. Robert Britton, an attorney for the company, said earlier this year that Revlon \u201cdisputes any link between cancer and its hair relaxer products.\u201d Thousands of Black women have also claimed that hair relaxers from L\u2019Oreal were harmful to their health, including a group of Black women who sued L\u2019Oreal and other companies last year. One woman, Bernadette Gordon, who used hair relaxers from 1983 to 2015, experienced uterine and breast cancer resulting in a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy, she previously told NBC News. In July, L\u2019Oreal asked a federal court to dismiss the dozens of consolidated lawsuits against the company, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cvague\u201d and based on \u201cunsupported conclusions.\u201d The company did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Many Black women straighten their hair to keep their jobs or advance to higher positions, which puts them at risk, Taylor said. \u201cThis is not a hoax,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that is actually harmful and could potentially cost them their lives.\u201d Still, there are many unknowns researchers are trying to uncover, including whether the products on the shelves today are going to lead to cases of uterine cancer in the future, Bertrand said. It is also not entirely clear why Black women are at an increased risk of developing and dying from uterine cancer.  \u201cWe continue to explore those factors \u2014 everything from environment to racism to genetics,\u201d she said.

        "title": "More than 100 women sue Boston doctor alleging they were sexually assaulted during exams",
        "content": "A group of women allege in a class action lawsuit that a Boston-based doctor performed inappropriate physical examinations on them that weren\u2019t medically necessary. The suit alleges that Dr. Derrick Todd \u2014 who worked as a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital until his departure in July \u2014 gave pelvic, breast and rectal exams for his own sexual gratification under the guise of providing medical care to patients. The patients suing say the behavior, which they say included harmful and offensive touching, amounted to sexual assault. Andrew Meyer, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said more than 100 women have joined the suit. Todd went \u201cwell beyond the normal examinations,\u201d Meyer said, and some patients felt coerced into allowing him to undress them and engage in unnecessary breast exams, pelvic exams or both. \u201cEvery one of these women felt that they were alone,\u201d Meyer said. The complaint, filed Friday, follows two other lawsuits filed against Todd last week. One of those similarly accuses him of sexual assault under the auspices of medical care. Jonathan Sweet, a lawyer at Keches Law Group who filed that suit, said he expects at least 10 of Todd\u2019s former patients to join the case but could not yet give a firm number. The third lawsuit was filed by a single plaintiff, who alleges that during her time as Todd\u2019s patient from November to July, he made sexually inappropriate remarks to her, coerced her to strip naked in from of him in the exam room and performed medically unnecessary exams that involved fondling her breasts and genitalia. Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital is listed as a co-defendant in all three lawsuits, along with two other practices where Todd worked. The suits allege that the inappropriate acts took place from at least as far back as 2011 through this July. A fourth suit that was filed against Todd in September by an unnamed patient has been sealed, The Boston Globe reported. Todd\u2019s attorney, Ingrid Martin, said in a statement that he has fully cooperated with all investigations. \u201cOver the course of his twenty year career in medicine, Dr. Derrick Todd has been recognized as a skilled and accomplished rheumatologist, internist, and primary care physician,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe is confident that when all the facts are considered \u2014 or even litigated \u2014 these allegations will be proven to be without merit,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of that will take place in the appropriate forums and not in the context of a media frenzy or a rush to judgement.\u201d Dr. Charles Morris, the chief medical officer at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, said the hospital began an internal investigation immediately after it received two anonymous complaints about Todd\u2019s conduct. \u201cHe was then placed on administrative leave once we learned more and, upon completion of that initial investigation, we made a decision to terminate him,\u201d Morris said in a statement. Todd\u2019s leave at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital began in June; his employment ended in July. Charles River Medical Associates, a group practice where Todd worked that specializes in internal medicine, said it did not receive or become aware of a complaint of inappropriate conduct by Todd through his last day at the practice. \u201cWe are disappointed and saddened by these disturbing allegations and recognize the courage it takes for these patients to come forward. Nothing is more important to Charles River Medical Associates than the health and safety of those patients who receive care at our practice,\u201d it said in a statement. It added that it has been reaching out to patients and providing them with opportunities to report their concerns. Morris said Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital has also reached out to Todd\u2019s current and former patients to speak with them about the care they received and connect them to additional services. \u201cWe deeply regret the harm Dr. Todd\u2019s actions has caused our patients and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take our duty to care for our patients and keep them safe extremely seriously. We have, and always will, act decisively on any allegations of misconduct, as we did in this case.\u201d Todd signed a voluntary agreement last month with the state medical board to stop practicing medicine. The agreement is not an admission of wrongdoing. He is not the only doctor who has faced allegations of sexual assault. A California doctor who specialized in treating members of the LGBTQ community was charged last month with sexually assaulting nine male patients under the guise of necessary medical exams. In July, Robert Hadden, a former obstetrician at Columbia University, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for enticing victims to cross state lines so he could sexually abuse them. A trial revealed that Hadden had sexually abused dozens of patients over more than two decades. ProPublica reported last month that more than 245 patients have alleged that Hadden abused them.

        "title": "Here's why it's OK to hit the snooze button",
        "content": "If you\u2019re concerned that by hitting the snooze button multiple times in the morning you could be hurting your sleep, you can sleep easy: For most people, \u201csnoozing\u201d has no impact on sleep quality, a new study suggests. What's more, for some, hitting the button multiple times over 30 minutes may spark alertness more quickly than sleeping through without a break, according to the study, published Wednesday in the Journal of Sleep Research. The study found \u201cthat snoozing for 30 minutes in the morning does not make you more tired or more likely to wake up from deep sleep,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Tina Sundelin, an associate professor in the department of psychology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said in an email. \u201cFor those who usually snooze, it might even be helpful with waking.\u201d Among the 1,732 adults who filled out a questionnaire about their waking habits in the morning, 69% said they hit the snooze button at least sometimes, especially on weekdays. Many, 60%, said they \u201cmost often\u201d or \u201calways\u201d fell asleep between alarms, the result being that, on average, snoozers got just a little less sleep. Overall, snoozers were more likely to be an average of six years younger than non-snoozers and almost four times more likely to be \u201cnight owls.\u201d Snoozers were also three times more likely to report feeling drowsy when they woke up. The top reason for choosing to snooze rather than have an unbroken stretch of sleep was that a person couldn\u2019t wake up or was too tired. The next two most common reasons were that snoozing feels good and that it allows a person to wake up more slowly or \u201csoftly.\u201d To take a closer look at the impact of snoozing, the researchers recruited 31 people to spend several nights in a sleep lab. All of the people included in this part of the study said they hit the snooze button several times in the morning at least two or more days a week. The participants\u2019 average age was about 27, and none had any sleep disorders, such as insomnia.  On two different nights, the participants were asked to try two methods of waking up: either getting up immediately after the alarm went off or 30 minutes after the alarm went off, pressing the snooze button three times. The total number of hours spent in bed was the same, regardless of whether a person snoozed or not \u2014 for example, when the participants were asked to snooze, the first alarm was set 30 minutes before the participants would usually get up. When the people were told to hit the snooze button, they got six minutes less sleep, on average, the study found, but the overall structure of their sleep was the same. The participants\u2019 cognitive abilities were tested right after they got out of bed and then again 40 minutes later. When it came to performance on cognitive tests, including recalling past experiences, testing reaction times and solving math problems quickly, snoozing appeared to give an advantage right after people rose. But that advantage disappeared within 40 minutes of getting out of bed.   \u201cWhen snoozing, as opposed to when having to wake up right away, I would say that they came to alertness quicker, even though there was no difference in how sleepy or alert they felt subjectively,\u201d Sundelin said. It\u2019s possible that snoozing is preferable to some people because it spreads out the process of waking up, said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research at Columbia University\u2019s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. \u201cPeople who snooze for 30 minutes are actually falling back to sleep between alarms,\u201d said St-Onge, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research. \u201cNot a deep sleep but a light sleep so that when they had to wake up at the end of 30 minutes they were not being yanked out of a deeper stage of sleep. They might have felt this was a more gentle awakening.\u201d The people in the second study were all confirmed snoozers, St-Onge said, adding that it might be interesting to run the same experiment with people who typically choose not to snooze. Dr. Beth Malow, the director of the sleep disorders division and a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said two of the reasons for choosing to snooze \u2014 that it \u201cfeels good\u201d and that it allowed people to wake up more \u201csoftly\u201d\u2014 were intriguing.  It may be that by waking up in stages, a person avoids being pulled out of REM sleep, said Malow, who also wasn\u2019t involved with the new research. \u201cYou might have a harder time if you\u2019re coming out of a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can be very jolting.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that snoozing is more common among young people, because we already know that sleep cycles are shifted later in teens and young adults, Malow said, adding that it may be that snoozers stop snoozing as they get older.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "Vaccine hesitancy increasing among pregnant women, a CDC report finds",
        "content": "As the winter respiratory illness season fast approaches, this is the first year that four vaccines are being recommended during pregnancy. Yet, there are already signs that fewer pregnant women are getting vaccinated \u2014 putting themselves and their newborns at increased risk of severe illness or death. \"We are meeting more resistance than I ever remember,\" said Dr. Neil Silverman, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UCLA Health. \"We didn't get this kind of pushback on this scale before the pandemic.\" \"Now all vaccines are lumped together as 'bad,'\" he said. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended for the first time that pregnant people get the RSV vaccine to protect against an infection that is usually mild in healthy adults but can be dangerous for children younger than 5. The new guidance means pregnant women will be encouraged to get four vaccines to protect against the flu, Covid and pertussis (also called whooping cough), as well as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.  However, a recent CDC report found growing doubts about vaccination during pregnancy.  Among almost 2,000 women who were pregnant during the height of last year's cold and flu season or when the survey was conducted in March and April, almost a quarter said they were \"very hesitant\" about getting a flu shot. That is a significant increase over the 17.2% who said they had the same level of reservations during the 2021-2022 respiratory illness season. That reluctance has translated to fewer pregnant women protected against influenza and other illnesses.  \"Even prior to the pandemic, it was a struggle to get pregnant women vaccinated,\" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Iowa Health Care, as well as a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Since then, skepticism about vaccines has ballooned and spread to common flu shots that have been given to millions of pregnant women over several decades without any evidence of problematic side effects.  Last year, the CDC study found, 47.2% of expectant mothers got their flu shots, down from 57.5% who got their flu shots during the pre-Covid 2019-20 season.  Just more than half, or 55.4%, got their Tdap vaccines and only 27.3% of women got the Covid booster before or during pregnancy last season, when omicron infections were filling hospitals. The Tdap vaccine protects newborns against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis and has been recommended during pregnancy since 2011. \"Tdap is just barely recovering from pre-pandemic levels,\" Jamieson said. \"The number of women vaccinated for Covid is disappointing.\" According to Dr. Linda Eckert, an OB-GYN and global health and immunization expert at the University of Washington, \"there's a bias that some patients have, more than they used to, about how they feel about a vaccine.\" When Eckert recommends a vaccine to her pregnant patients, more now react with, \"I'm not going to talk about it,\" she said.  Pregnant women are primed to question everything they put in their body, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, experts say.  \"That instinct is a good one. It's protective mothering,\" said Dr. Jodie Dionne, associate director of Global Health in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Center for Women's Reproductive Health. \"We actually want women to question what they're putting in their body.\" \"There are a lot of myths out there, what I would call blatant disinformation that is intended to be more politically charged, not based in science,\" said Dr. Melissa Simon, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The only way doctors can address those concerns effectively, Dionne said, is to \"create an open atmosphere where they feel comfortable telling you what they're worried about.\" A key finding in the CDC report is that when obstetricians or providers talked to women about the need for vaccination, they were less hesitant. \"A lot more people are vaccine hesitant than anti-vaccine,\" Eckert said. \"Vaccine hesitant individuals tend to be curious.\" Doctors perfected their skills addressing patients' vaccine concerns when Covid shots became \"crucial,\" said Dr. Sarah Pachtman, a maternal/fetal physician at Northwell Health's Katz Women's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York.  \"We've had so much practice,\" she said, adding that she's encountered less vaccine hesitancy this year compared to before the pandemic.  \"I noticed myself spending more time counseling patients,\" she said. \"That helps decrease their hesitancy.\" During pregnancy, the belly enlarges, pushing up against the diaphragm, decreasing lung capacity. That makes pregnant women \u2014 especially those late in their pregnancies \u2014 more vulnerable to breathing difficulties, Simon said. \"When an infection like RSV or Covid or influenza gets into that lung space, it's even harder for people who are pregnant to breathe,\" she said. Pregnant women are one of the most at-risk groups for flu complications. Covid can also be harmful during pregnancy, and can increase the risk of preterm births and other complications. The virus almost killed Haeli Graham of Swansboro, North Carolina, and caused her son to be born three months early. On July 4, 2021, Graham, then 27 years old and six months pregnant, went to the emergency room, \"gasping for air,\" she said. \"I couldn't breathe and I couldn't feel my baby moving anymore,\" she said. A Covid test came back positive. Within days, her lungs collapsed and she developed two pulmonary embolisms. She was intubated and put into a medically induced coma to give her lungs time to heal. Graham had no idea that doctors had to deliver her baby early until she woke up more than a month later. \"I was speechless,\" she said. \"It was just shocking that me \u2014 a very healthy, active 27-year-old female \u2014 could have died.\" Her son, Colton, was born at just 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Despite some delays, he is now a healthy 2 year old. Though Covid vaccines were available by summer 2021, Graham's doctor at the time advised her against getting the shot, citing a lack of evidence about their safety. \"It was a very scary time,\" Graham said. \"We had no idea what to do.\" It was not until August 2021, a month after she had been hospitalized with Covid, that the CDC said it had gathered enough evidence to recommend the shots for pregnant people. Now is the time for flu, as well as Covid shots \u2014 just ahead of the typical winter respiratory virus season, experts say. Those shots can be given at any stage of pregnancy, according to the CDC.  Timing for the two other recommended shots is more specific and should be given during the third trimester. The Tdap vaccine is given between the 27th and 36th weeks of gestation, ideally during the earlier part of that timeline. That timing \"helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth,\" the CDC says on its website. That is especially important when it comes to protecting against whooping cough.  Babies are not eligible for the shots themselves until they're several months old. \"Babies who catch whooping cough, especially those younger than 3 months old, are most likely to have serious problems, have to be cared for in a hospital, and possibly even die,\" Tami Skoff, a CDC epidemiologist, wrote in an email. \"Vaccinating women during every pregnancy is critical for providing the best protection to the youngest of babies.\" A CDC study published in February found that the number of babies 2 months and younger who developed whooping cough was significantly lower after the vaccines were recommended. The vaccine is given during each subsequent pregnancy because those antibodies decrease in the mother's body over time. The single-dose RSV shot from Pfizer is recommended between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. It was found to lower the risk of severe RSV among infants by 91% within the first three months after birth, a time when babies are especially vulnerable. Last winter, a surge of RSV among young children overwhelmed hospitals.  Doctors insist there is no danger in vaccinations during pregnancy. \"We've been vaccinating pregnant people for decades,\" Silverman said. \"While any vaccine for any person, pregnant or not, can have a rare side effect, those serious side effects are exceedingly low. And none of these vaccines have ever been shown to have any negative impact on the fetus or newborn.\" \"Vaccines are a very efficient way to protect mothers and to protect their babies in one fell swoop,\" he said.

        "title": "Buffalo Bills' Damien Harris taken off field in ambulance after neck injury",
        "content": "Buffalo Bills running back Damien Harris was taken off the field in an ambulance after a hard hit that injured his neck Sunday night, a terrifying scene reminiscent of Damar Hamlin's collapse 10 months ago. Late in the second quarter of the \"Sunday Night Football\" game in Orchard Park, New York, Harris ran up the middle on a third-and-inches play and was brought down by New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke. After the tackle, Harris was conscious \u2014 moving his arms and head \u2014 but he could not get up as concerned teammates and opponents gathered around him. A hush fell over Highmark Stadium as medical personnel rushed on to the field, secured Harris to a stretcher and loaded him into an ambulance. Play was restarted after a five-minute delay. The Bills announced Harris had injured his neck and was out for the rest of the game. Relieved Bills coach Sean McDermott said after the game that Harris was \"heading in a good direction\" and had regained \"full movement\" of his extremities. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding he has full movement,\u201d McDermott told reporters after his team's dramatic 14-9 victory over the Giants. \u201cFortunate that he is seemingly heading in a good direction, with the reports we are getting. So I am very thankful to God for that.\u201d Harris, 26, a backup running back, is in his fifth season of professional football after having played at Alabama. This is his first season in Buffalo after he spent the previous four campaigns with the New England Patriots. His best season was in 2021, when he rushed for 929 yards and scored 15 touchdowns. The ambulance that took Harris off the field n Sunday is decorated with \"3\" on each of its back doors, in honor of Hamlin, his teammate who nearly died on the field during a Jan. 3 game in Cincinnati last season. Hamlin went into cardiac arrest after a routine tackle early in that game. Medical personnel performed CPR and his heartbeat was restored before he was rushed to the hospital and the game was called off. He has rejoined the team, but he has played sparingly this season.

        "title": "Here's what it would take for insurance to cover weight loss drugs",
        "content": "The makers of Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro are racing to prove that the incredibly popular drugs have health benefits beyond weight loss and diabetes. Doing so, they say, will make it easier for patients to get insurance to cover the pricey medications.  Clinical trials are underway to see whether the drugs can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and other chronic diseases in people with obesity.  Even though obesity is associated with a number of health risks, insurance companies often don\u2019t cover the cost of weight loss medications, which can exceed $1,000 for a month\u2019s supply.  \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s not covered is because there is a perception that obesity is considered a cosmetic issue as opposed to a chronic disease,\u201d said Dr. Peminda Cabandugama, an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cBut these medications not only help with weight loss, but give cardiac benefits, help with blood pressure, help cholesterol and kill sleep apnea.\u201d Another barrier is a 2003 law that prohibits Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, cutting off a huge group of potential patients. Private insurance companies also often take cues about what to cover from the federal program. \u201cWe recognize that these medications are priced very highly by pharmaceutical companies,\u201d said Dr. Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. \u201cCoverage and accessibility is definitely going to be the biggest challenge as we move forward in treating people with obesity.\u201d In August, Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, became the first to demonstrate in a large clinical trial that the drugs provide health benefits beyond weight loss and diabetes management. In a phase 3 trial of more than 17,000 adults with obesity, Wegovy was shown to cut the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, by 20%. (Ozempic, approved for Type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy, approved for weight loss, both contain the same drug, called semaglutide.) Tchang said that while earlier clinical trials for drugs like semaglutide for diabetes and weight loss found that the drugs also improved blood pressure and cholesterol \u2014 two risk factors for heart disease \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration needs standalone studies looking at heart health in order for a company to be able to say the drug has that benefit. Last week, Novo Nordisk announced results from another clinical trial that found that Ozempic slowed the progression of kidney disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes.   Eli Lilly, the maker of diabetes drug Mounjaro, is expected to get the drug approved for weight loss late this year or early next year. On Sunday, at the 2023 ObesityWeek conference in Dallas, Lilly presented the full results from its SURMOUNT-3 trial, which found that after 72 weeks, people who took tirzepatide, the drug found in Mounjaro, lost about 60 pounds, while those who got a placebo regained weight. Both groups had been asked to make intensive lifestyle changes, including following low-calorie diet, exercising and attending weekly counseling sessions for 12 weeks before starting the medication. Lilly also hopes to secure approval for a different weight loss drug, called retatrutide, within the next few years. At the same time, the drugmaker is also conducting several clinical trials to see whether its drugs can treat obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other chronic diseases. \"There are lots of benefits to be gained,\" Dr. Nadia Ahmad, Eli Lilly\u2019s medical director of obesity clinical development, said of the drugs. After losing weight, \"there's more cardiometabolic benefits, the blood pressure goes down further, the insulin goes down further, lipids improve further.\" Ahmad said the clinical trials will provide important insights for physicians treating patients, as well as for insurance companies and governments when determining whether to include weight loss drugs in their coverage. \"All this data helps to inform decisions, whether the decision's made by providers or government,\" she said. Mike Bergmann, 38, of Fort Myers, Florida, was initially lucky to get his insurance to cover his Wegovy prescription.  Bergmann said that despite running about 4 miles a day for about a year, he struggled to lose weight until he started taking Wegovy in December.  \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to try this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI work as a mortgage loan officer, so I\u2019m pretty much in the office early in the morning until late.\u201d In a few short months, he said he lost around 50 pounds, as well as the desire to drink alcohol.  He said that he could have lost more weight if his insurance hadn\u2019t unexpectedly stopped covering his prescription over the summer. The insurer claimed that the drug was not medically necessary, and suggested diet and exercise instead.  Without coverage, he couldn\u2019t cover the out-of-pocket cost of the drug \u2014 about $1,300 a month.  But Bergmann said he would\u2019ve stayed on it if he could.  There are some indications insurers and lawmakers may be coming around to the idea of covering weight loss drugs.  In 2021, House lawmakers introduced The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which would have allowed the federal government to expand Medicare Part D coverage to include weight loss medications. The bipartisan legislation had 154 co-sponsors, according to Congress.gov, but did not receive a vote on the House floor before the term ended. What\u2019s more, the Congressional Budget Office said this month it is calling for new research to support the use of weight loss drugs under Medicare as well as the potential savings they could provide.  Employers may also be warming up to covering weight loss drugs.  (Because most Americans get their health insurance through work, employers play an important role in deciding what a company\u2019s plan will cover.) Research being presented on Monday at the ObesityWeek conference found that human resources executives and benefits consultants have overwhelmingly positive opinions about weight loss drugs, agreeing that the medications can help employees feel more in control of their weight and enhance their overall quality of life.   The findings \u2014 based on a survey conducted from May to December 2022 \u2014 also indicate, however, that these executives and consultants want more data on the drugs\u2019 additional health benefits to warrant the high cost before offering coverage to their employees. \"HR benefits specialists really see a potential role as far as improving and treating obesity and its other related conditions and improving quality of life for employees,\" said Dr. Kimberly Gudzune, an associate professor of medicine at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who is presenting the findings. \"But now we're really looking at and are hoping for more information on that financial side.\" In the meantime, Gudzune said employees, even at smaller companies, could potentially benefit from speaking with the HR representatives about why they don't cover weight loss medication. \"I think there is a role for employees sort of advocating,\" she said.

        "title": "Fears rise as three Alabama hospitals prepare to stop delivering babies",
        "content": "By the end of the month, two Alabama hospitals will stop delivering babies. A third will follow suit a few weeks later. That will leave two counties \u2014 Shelby and Monroe \u2014 without any birthing hospitals, and strip a predominantly Black neighborhood in Birmingham of a sought-after maternity unit. After that, pregnant women in Shelby County will have to travel at least 17 miles farther to reach a hospital with an OB-GYN. And because the county, one of Alabama\u2019s largest, is bordered by another whose hospital also lacks an obstetrics unit, some of those residents are also losing the closest place they could go to deliver their babies.  \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of dread knowing that there\u2019s going to be families who are now not only driving to the county over, but driving through three counties,\u201d said Honour McDaniel, director of maternal and infant health initiatives for the March of Dimes in Alabama. People in Monroe County, meanwhile, could face drives between 35 to 100 miles to a labor and delivery department.   Trekking that far to give birth is not unheard of in Alabama, in which more than a third of the counties are maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes \u2014 meaning they have no hospital with obstetrics care, birth centers, OB-GYNs or certified nurse midwives. The state has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country; only three others had higher rates between 2018 and 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alabama also had the nation\u2019s third-highest infant mortality rate in 2021, the latest data available. Physicians currently or formerly affiliated with the Alabama maternity units about to close fear the consequences for pregnant women and babies, especially if people are not able to reach birthing hospitals quickly enough in emergencies. \u201cPeople are going to show up delivering in the ER, and you\u2019re going to have bad outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Jesanna Cooper, an OB-GYN who formerly worked at Princeton Baptist Medical Center, the Birmingham hospital closing its maternity services. \u201cIf you show up with a very premature baby and deliver in the ER, and you don\u2019t have a NICU and you don\u2019t have an obstetrics team, things aren\u2019t going to go well.\u201d The closures come as the need for obstetrics care in Alabama is anticipated to rise as a result of its abortion laws. The state has banned almost all abortions since June 2022. The hospitals losing obstetrics departments in Birmingham and Shelby County are both part of Brookwood Baptist Health, a health care network with five hospitals in Alabama. A spokesperson for the network declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview but said in a statement that the decision came \u201cafter careful consideration.\u201d \u201cWe will support a smooth transition of care for patients and Brookwood Baptist Health remains committed to providing outstanding maternity care within our network,\u201d the statement said.  Monroe County Hospital, meanwhile, attributed the closure of its labor and delivery unit to a staffing shortage. The department has just one physician, and at least two are needed to keep labor and delivery services running. \u201cIt seems no amount of money provided by the hospital board for the support of Labor and Delivery has been sufficient to maintain this service. We have supported, and would continue to support, Labor and Delivery if there was someone who could provide the service,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. In some cases, keeping maternity units open is a financial challenge, since the departments aren\u2019t always profitable, several Alabama physicians said. Around 9% of the state\u2019s residents have no health insurance, according to a report from the Census Bureau, and almost half of the births in Alabama are covered by Medicaid. Reimbursements for that program can be substantially lower than for private insurance plans. \u201cNobody wants women and children to do poorly, but you also can\u2019t lose money year over year on a service line,\u201d said Dr. John Waits, CEO of the nonprofit Cahaba Medical Care, which runs medical clinics that take patients regardless of their ability to pay. Several of Cahaba\u2019s physicians deliver babies at Princeton Baptist and Shelby Baptist.  \u201cThere\u2019s something broken about the funding stream that helps us take care of our women and children,\u201d Waits said. Such challenges are not isolated to Alabama. Nationally, fewer than half of rural hospitals have labor and delivery services, according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy-focused nonprofit. And so far this year, obstetrics departments have also closed in California, Idaho, Massachusetts and Tennessee.   The stakes of losing these services are high. A 2018 study found that rural counties that lost obstetric services reported more preterm births within the following year than those that maintained such care. Preterm birth is associated with low birth weight, which was the second leading cause of infant death in 2021, according to the CDC. Dr. Rowell Ashford, an OB-GYN with Cahaba who practices at Princeton and Shelby, said that living far from a hospital with obstetrics care can discourage patients from getting health issues checked out. \u201cIf patients have blood pressure issues that they\u2019re not tending to because they don\u2019t want to be bothered with the extra 45-minute drive to go be evaluated, then there\u2019ll be times where patients truly have life-threatening issues, but due to the distance and difficulty in getting to the hospital, they may choose not to be evaluated,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just feeds into the problem relating to neonatal morbidity and mortality and maternal morbidity and mortality.\u201d A long drive might also deter some people from going to the hospital early in labor, Ashford added, which could lead babies to be born en route. Although Princeton Baptist isn\u2019t the only place to go to deliver a baby in Birmingham, its unique approach has gained a reputation. The hospital \u2014 located in an area in which 40% of the residents live in poverty \u2014 welcomes doulas, boasts a diverse obstetrics team, has staff specially trained to support moms in breastfeeding and provides water tubs to patients in labor. It also had the lowest cesarean section rate in Jefferson County as of 2020.  Dr. Heather Skanes, an OB-GYN at Princeton, said that some of her patients have traveled there from as far as Selma.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a fancy unit. We didn\u2019t have anything really fancy about the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were coming there because of how well they were treated.\u201d JohnQueta Bailey Archie, 43, delivered her son, Jayce, at Princeton in 2021, under the care of Ashford. It had been almost 20 years since she\u2019d given birth to her older son, and her second pregnancy was high-risk, because she had developed blood clots and fibroids. Plus, as a Black woman, she was aware of the racial disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes.  At Princeton, she said, \u201cI felt like I was heard, I was seen.\u201d  Ahna Frye, 32, has delivered two babies at Princeton: her older son, Holland, in 2020, and another son, Hutton, in May. During her first pregnancy, she said, she had hoped to give birth at home but went to Princeton on her midwife\u2019s advice after learning that her blood pressure had climbed dangerously high.  Skanes eventually delivered Holland via C-section, but Frye said she never felt rushed into surgery.  Frye, a resident of Shelby County, said she chose Princeton because the hospital respected her birth plan. But she knew that if anything went wrong \u2014 and it could have, given her risk of pre-eclampsia \u2014 Shelby Baptist was right nearby.  If she gets pregnant again, neither option will be available. \u201cFor our family personally, we\u2019re not done having kids,\u201d Frye said. But she doesn\u2019t want to do that without a place like Princeton, she added, and also knows that the distance she\u2019d have to drive in an emergency is about to jump from 10 to 35 minutes.  \u201cThat\u2019s the difference in life and death,\u201d she said.

        "title": "For people with sickle cell disease, ERs can mean life-threatening waits",
        "content": "Heather Avant always dresses up when she goes to the emergency room. \u201cI\u2019ve been conditioned to act and behave in a very specific way,\u201d said Avant. \u201cI try to do my hair. I make sure I shower, have nice clothes. Sometimes I put on my University of Michigan shirt.\u201d It\u2019s a strategy to combat discrimination the 42-year-old photographer of Mesquite, Texas, has developed over a lifetime of managing her sickle cell disease, a rare blood disorder that affects an estimated 100,000 Americans. The hereditary condition can affect a person of any race or ethnicity, but Black patients, like Avant, make up the majority of those afflicted in the U.S. For people living with the disease, a sickle cell crisis can happen at any time. When it does, their rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells become stuck in their blood vessels, blocking flow and causing extreme pain or breathing difficulties. A crisis can escalate into life-threatening complications such as strokes, seizures, and sepsis. When a pain crisis can\u2019t be managed at home, patients head to the ER to access the high dosage of opioids they need, in addition to IVs to help with dehydration or even blood transfusions. Yet staffers in emergency departments \u2014 already overextended and grappling with nursing shortages \u2014 don\u2019t always have experience in treating the rare disease. Doctors, amid a still-raging opioid crisis, remain resistant to prescribing the painkillers necessary to treat sickle cell crises. So, patients say, they face long delays before receiving essential care, plus discrimination and suspicion that they are seeking drugs to get high. \u201cI have to look like I\u2019m not coming in here off the street looking for medication,\u201d said Avant. \u201cI have to put on an entire show to get you to believe that I need care.\u201d Years of research have documented the delays. A study published in 2013 found that patients seeking care from 2003 through 2008 at an ER for their sickle cell crises experienced 50% longer wait times than patients who arrived at ERs with broken legs or arms. A study published in 2021 found that 50% of sickle cell patients reported having to wait at least two hours before their pain was treated, despite medical guidelines recommending such patients in crisis receive their first dose of pain medication no more than 60 minutes after arriving at the ER. Medical associations such as the American Society of Hematology, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Emergency Nurses Association have established guidelines for emergency department-based care of sickle cell pain. And, in 2021, the Emergency Department Sickle Cell Care Coalition, a national collaboration of hematologists, pharmacists, and nurses, helped launch a point-of-care tool to help medical professionals manage the disease in the ER. But patients and sickle cell experts said those best practices haven\u2019t been widely adopted. A 2020 survey of nearly 250 emergency medicine providers found that 75% of them were unaware of the NHLBI\u2019s recommendations, first published in 2014, yet 98% felt confident in their ability to treat patients with sickle cell disease. Still, ER horror stories abound among adults with sickle cell disease. For Lesly Chavez, 29, a Houston hairstylist, her worst experience occurred a few years ago. She said she spent four hours in a waiting room before getting seen. \u201cAnd when they finally got to me, they told me they could help with \u2018my addiction,\u2019 but they decided that there was nothing that they could do for me,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cThey just flat-out said \u2018no\u2019 and sent me home while I was in crisis.\u201d Chavez said she has since avoided that hospital even though it\u2019s 10 minutes from her home. Now she drives to a different ER, 30 minutes away. Chavez, who is Hispanic, said that she confronts \u201cdoubt everywhere I go\u201d because sickle cell disease primarily affects Black Americans. (Those who are Hispanic can be of any race.) Paula Tanabe, a professor of nursing at Duke University, who has spent decades researching ways to improve care for sickle cell patients, said a confluence of factors adds to the racial bias patients may face. \u201cEmergency rooms are incredibly overcrowded, at rates that we have never seen before, and that\u2019s for everyone,\u201d said Tanabe. Legislators are trying to help. One federal bill introduced in June would allocate $8.2 million annually for five years to a program that trains doctors on best practices for caring for sickle cell patients. Another, introduced this spring, would provide funding for community organizations working to spread awareness about the condition and give student loan relief to medical providers who commit to working on the disease. Some state legislatures have established sickle cell task forces to improve physician education and care coordination. Advocates for sickle cell patients said investment in data collection to track the disease is also important. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 100,000 Americans have it, the true number is unknown. That\u2019s because no national system exists to collect data on sickle cell, unlike other conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m 32 and we\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s 100,000 my entire life,\u201d said Quannecia McCruse, who co-founded the Sickle Cell Association of Houston. \u201cI know there\u2019s more. I know people are going uncounted.\u201d Eleven state-led data collection programs currently exist and, in February, the CDC opened a new grant application for additional states. Improved data would allow funding to be allocated toward the areas with the greatest need, sickle cell patient advocates said. Texas had an opportunity to join those efforts. This spring, the state legislature passed a bill with broad bipartisan support to create a sickle cell patient registry, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed it, saying it would compromise patient privacy. \u201cThat was a bad excuse,\u201d said McCruse. \u201cWe have a cancer registry already, and everyone\u2019s information is safe. That registry would have gone a long way to help.\u201d While progress grinds slowly, patients like McCruse say they\u2019re forced to balance advocating for themselves during bouts of excruciating pain against the need not to irritate or alienate hospital staffers. \u201cIt feels like someone is taking a Taser and shocking the crap out of me. Or when it\u2019s really bad, and it feels like shards of glass are just moving through my veins,\u201d said the mother of two. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very painful. And you\u2019re telling somebody whose body is torturing them that it\u2019s not that bad?\u201d Alexis Thompson, a hematologist who treats sickle cell patients at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said she works with her pediatric patients to develop self-advocacy skills. But sometimes that backfires. \u201cThe great irony is patients who are well informed and capable of self-advocating are being accused of being manipulative, because they are capable of articulating very clearly what\u2019s effective for them down to the name of the medication or the absolute dose,\u201d Thompson said. Sickle cell experts recommend that doctors adhere to a patient\u2019s individual pain plan, if available. Thompson said those plans, which document patients\u2019 diagnoses alongside a recommended medication and dosage, can be uploaded to online portals that patients can pull up on their cellphones when visiting an ER to verify what they need. Patients such as Avant hope such steps can help decrease their ER waits while easing their anxiety about seeking emergency care. \u201cI don\u2019t fear dying,\u201d said Avant, \u201cbut I do fear dying in the hospital.\u201d KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

        "content": "Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton remains in intensive care battling severe pneumonia, but she is improving and responding to treatment, her daughter said Saturday, calling her progress \"truly remarkable.\" \"We're thrilled to share some uplifting news,\" McKenna Kelley said on Instagram. \"Prayers have been felt and are being answered. Although she remains in ICU, her path to recovery is steadily progressing. Her fighting spirit is truly shining!\" Kelley had said Retton was critically ill with a \"very rare form of pneumonia,\" according to a crowdfunding page she started to raise money for hospital bills. Kelley said her mother didn\u2019t have health insurance. It\u2019s not clear where Retton, who lives in Houston, is being treated. Retton, 55, has been in the hospital ICU for more than a week. Kelley has said her mother couldn\u2019t breathe on her own. But Saturday, Kelley shared that Retton, the five-time Olympic medalist, isn\u2019t relying on machines as much and that her breathing \"is becoming stronger.\" \"Though it's a lengthy journey, witnessing these improvements is incredibly heartening! She's beginning to respond to treatments,\" Kelley wrote. \"Once more, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your overwhelming love and support.\" Retton became the first American woman to win a gold medal in gymnastics when she scored a perfect 10 in the all-around competition at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. She went on to win four more medals, for a total of five, more than any other athlete that summer. After she retired, Retton was a board member for USA Gymnastics and faced backlash for defending the organization amid the Larry Nassar sexual assault case. USA Gymnastics declined to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017; instead Retton and USA Gymnastics officials had a private discussion with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to discuss the organization's policies to protect athletes from sexual abuse. Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News. ",

        "content": "Kaiser Permanente and labor unions reached a tentative deal Friday morning, a little more than a week after workers at the nation\u2019s largest health care nonprofit organization went on strike. The three-day walkout was the largest work stoppage of health care workers in U.S. history, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. \"The frontline healthcare workers of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions are excited to have reached a tentative agreement with Kaiser Permanente as of this morning. We are thankful for the instrumental support of Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su,\" the coalition said in a Facebook statement. Kaiser Permanente, which serves nearly 13 million people nationwide, shared a similar statement on Facebook. The two sides agreed to a four-year deal that will give coalition members new minimum wages over three years that will reach $25 an hour in California and $23 an hour in other states, Kaiser said. Under the new tentative agreement, union workers are \"guaranteed across-the-board wage increases totaling 21% over four years,\" the enhancement of \"employees' Performance Sharing Plan with minimum payout opportunities and a substantial maximum payout opportunity,\" and more investments in job training and development. More than 75,000 union members had walked out after the company and labor negotiators failed to come to an agreement on staffing levels. The union wanted better pay and benefits for its members as well as a long-term solution to the staffing shortage. Kaiser said the new agreement will help address the staffing issue.   Workers including pharmacists, vocational nurses, housekeepers, medical assistants, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, and respiratory therapists left hospitals and medical facilities at 6 a.m. local time on Oct. 4. The strike also included employees who served in Washington state, Oregon, California and Colorado, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Sarah Levesque, the secretary-treasurer for OPEIU Local 2, previously told NBC News\u2019 Tom Costello, that workers could not adequately do their jobs because of staffing issues. \"These people got into health care because they wanted to take care of patients, and they\u2019re just stretched too thin,\" she said. \"It\u2019s taking up to three months to get appointments with some of the doctors.\" Many others expressed similar sentiments. Lorena Jackson, who works in scheduling in primary care in Aurora, Colorado, said that some patients had waited more than a month to be seen by a physician. David Hawa, an ambulatory care pharmacist in Springfield, Virginia, said he's experienced \"frustrated customers on the phone or in line.\" Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Flu and RSV are starting to rise in the U.S., as Covid peaks in some areas",
        "content": "Flu cases are low nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday, but there are early signs that the virus is beginning to spread. \"Even these low levels will probably increase in the next couple of weeks,\" said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. That is typical for flu seasons, which tend to ramp up by December and peak in February. Budd said that the agency is not detecting the unusually early rise in flu activity that occurred last year, when kids and teenagers were hit especially hard. Most of the flu cases reported so far this season are influenza type A, specifically the H1N1 strain. A CDC report released Thursday found that children were \"disproportionately impacted\" by the flu last year. One of the study's authors, Danielle Iuliano, also a senior research epidemiologist at the CDC, said that the numbers of flu-related pediatric doctors' visits and hospitalizations were higher during the 2022-23 flu season than in previous years. Nearly all of those cases were flu type A, mostly H3N2. Just under 20% were classified as H1N1. \"Given what we saw last year,\" Iuliano said, \"vaccinating kids is really important to prevent them from getting sick, prevent them from being hospitalized and having the most severe outcomes.\" Doctors recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot, and say that now is the time to make that appointment. \"I tell my patients to get vaccinated by Halloween,\" said Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic. It takes at least two weeks after getting the shot to make antibodies for the maximum possible protection. \"We want to make sure everybody is protected before the holiday season, and that starts with Thanksgiving,\" Englund said. Three bugs are likely to circulate this winter: flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). There are early signs that those viruses are already spreading, though at relatively low levels, according to WastewaterSCAN. The group receives data from wastewater collection sites in 36 states three times a week, looking for evidence of viruses shed in sewage. \"We have started to see some increases in the rate at which we're detecting flu across the country\" as well as RSV, said Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. A late summer uptick in Covid seems to have peaked, Wolfe said. \"But those levels are still quite a bit higher on average right now than they were in the middle of the summer,\" Wolfe said. Still, doctors urge people to do what they can to keep viral activity down as the U.S. heads into cold and flu season \u2014 including masking in some cases. Updated Covid shots and a new vaccine protecting pregnant women and older adults against RSV are available. In anticipation of increases of Covid, RSV and the flu, the Cleveland Clinic will begin requesting that everyone visiting hospitalized patients wear a mask starting next week. It is not a mandate, however. People \"come here to get better, and not necessarily to get exposed to something new,\" Englund said. \"They certainly don't need to be getting sicker from a visitor or a caregiver who might have any of these respiratory viruses.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "Largest ever genetic study of Raynaud's phenomenon could lead to new treatments",
        "content": "Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, which causes parts of the body like the fingers and the toes to go cold and numb, likely stems from two genes, a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications found.  The results of the study \u2014 the largest genetic study of the condition to date \u2014 could lead to more effective treatments, experts said.  In people with Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, cold temperatures or stress trigger spasms in the small blood vessels near the surface of the skin, causing the vessels to constrict and limit blood flow. The fingers and toes are most commonly affected, according to the Mayo Clinic. The skin will turn white or blue and then red when the attack ebbs. \u201cIt gets painful and numb,\u201d said Dr. Marie Gerhard-Herman, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a staff physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital specializing in cardiovascular medicine. During an attack, people may not be able to move their hands as they want, added Gerhard-Herman, who was not involved with the new study. Dr. Laura Hummers, a rheumatologist and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that while medications for Raynaud\u2019s are available, they can have unwanted side effects. \u201cThe main therapy currently is a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers,\u201d said Hummers, who was also not involved with the new research. \u201cThose therapies are fairly helpful.\u201d But they lower blood pressure, which can be a problem for otherwise healthy people, she said. And they can cause side effects, such as constipation, dizziness and headache, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Raynaud\u2019s occurs in 2% to 5% of the population, more commonly in women, and takes two forms. Primary Raynaud\u2019s is by far the most common and is typically diagnosed in teenage girls and women in their 20s, Gerhard-Herman said. Its symptoms are often manageable with lifestyle changes alone, such as avoiding cold and limiting stress. However, some patients\u2019 symptoms are so bothersome that they must use medication.  The genes identified in the study are linked to primary Raynaud\u2019s. Secondary Raynaud\u2019s is rare and its symptoms can be more serious, including ulcers on fingers and gangrene, and medication is often necessary. It occurs in people with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, which causes thickening and inflammation of the skin, and lupus, which causes inflammation throughout the body. Raynaud\u2019s runs in families and is heritable. \u201cAbout half the people who have primary Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon have another first-degree relative who also has Raynaud\u2019s,\u201d said Hummers, who co-directs John Hopkins Scleroderma Center.  The new study explains why.  Researchers in London and Berlin looked at data from more than 440,000 people in the UK Biobank, a massive database containing genetic and medical information.The team identified 5,147 cases of Raynaud\u2019s, 68% of which were primary Raynaud\u2019s. Another 439,294 records served as controls. \u201cWe identify two distinct genes that point to two distinct mechanisms,\u201d said Maik Pietzner, one of the study\u2019s lead researchers and chair in health data modeling at Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute. One gene variant affects how blood vessels narrow. People with this variant have a high number of a particular receptor for hormones that are released when the body is stressed or cold, he said. These hormones signal the tiny blood vessels in the skin to constrict, allowing blood to flow away from the extremities and to the body\u2019s vital organs. The other gene variant affects how blood vessels dilate, or relax, he said. The findings could hopefully lead to new treatments: Drugs could be developed that target this hormone receptor, for example, Pietzner said. One existing drug, an antidepressant called mirtazapine, already acts on the receptor and could possibly be repurposed for people with Raynaud\u2019s, he said.  \u201cFor patients, it\u2019s all about finding treatments,\u201d he said.   While the two gene variants were linked to primary Raynaud\u2019s, not to the secondary form, any new drugs developed might help people with both, Hummers said. The researchers noted that the study had limitations. For example, they relied on diagnostic codes in people\u2019s electronic health records, which aren\u2019t always reliable. As a result, some cases of Raynaud\u2019s may have been missed while others might have been misdiagnosed. In addition, the participants were all of European descent, and so the results cannot be generalized to all people. More studies are needed, the researchers wrote. \u201cThey need to actually look at people with other ancestries,\u201d Gerhard-Herman said.  Still, the large study is the first to identify the underlying genetics of the condition. \u201cThe genetic studies that have been done in Raynaud\u2019s up until this point hadn\u2019t been as compelling as this one,\u201d Hummers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward,\u201d she said.

        "content": "After contracting Covid for the third time, in May 2022, S. Monet Wahls noticed that her usual fall and winter cough became a perpetual, year-round hacking. Respiratory issues made sleeping at night challenging. Lingering, chronic symptoms like Wahls\u2019 illustrate the potential effect of multiple cases of Covid on one person, doctors told NBC News. While there seems to be a range of experiences each time a person gets Covid, Dr. Geoffrey Mount Varner, an emergency room physician in Maryland and Virginia, said Black people should be vigilant about avoiding multiple Covid infections. Left unchecked, the effects of the virus could devastate Black communities.  \u201cSome of the data clearly showed that Covid impacted Blacks disproportionately, so it only makes sense that it\u2019s going to be the same with multiple infections because there are so many people who had it,\u201d Varner said. \u201cAnd because we have more comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity \u2014 the main drivers in terms of having a negative impact as it relates to Covid \u2014 with multiple infections the data is showing that each infection is like a health insult that will manifest itself more in the hardest-hit community, which is Black people. So, you have a sick person getting this virus more than once and the outcome is going to be different, more harmful, than white counterparts.\u201d According to a wide-reaching meta-analysis published in 2021, Black people diagnosed with Covid were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units. \u201cI\u2019m already living with the aftermath of Covid,\u201d said Wahls, a business consultant in Brooklyn, New York. \u201cThe health issues I had have increased to serious levels. So, people like me, who had a near-death experience with Covid and has had it two other times \u2026 we know of the effects of it going through your body and causing problems you didn\u2019t have before having Covid.\u201d The virus strongly affects Black people, who often live in areas where access to quality health care is not easily available. The lower likelihood of having health insurance and decreased access to clinical care only exacerbated the effects of Covid among Blacks and Latinos, creating a cycle of hardships that could stunt family growth, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, a cardiologist and the executive director of the Covid task force at Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Black person and you get Covid multiple times, you\u2019re talking about increasing your chances of disability,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your inability to take care of your family because you have these Covid-related health challenges.\u201d William Matos, an attorney in Atlanta, had Covid three times, the first and harshest case of migraines and body aches around Christmas 2021. \u201cIt was murderous,\u201d he said. Matos got the vaccination and booster shot, and his other cases of the coronavirus were not as severe \u2014 more like allergies, he said \u2014 but he said he is concerned about what could happen in the future. \u201cThe impact of long Covid lingers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople said it would be like the flu. Well, you get the flu and you get over it, hopefully, and you move on. That\u2019s not what doctors are telling us about what they are seeing with Covid. You get it multiple times and it\u2019s doing something to the body that the flu hasn\u2019t.\u201d  Morgan, the cardiologist, said: \u201cThe omicron variant is smart enough to confirm mild symptoms and give people a false sense of security, but stealth enough to be the most infectious variant we\u2019ve had. It\u2019s so incredibly successful, infecting people over and over again and making people say, \u2018Oh, this is nothing.\u2019 But it keeps swirling around. Reinfection doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019ll be protected from the next evolution of the variants, which are hurting people now. So people have to take protective measures over reckless behavior, which, we are seeing now, is not without consequences.\u201d Some of those protective measures, Varner said, are well known, like wearing a mask in public, crowded places; thorough washing of hands; and getting the vaccine and booster shots. He added that vitamins and minerals may also help fight against Covid. \u201cVitamins like C and D, as well as zinc, have been shown to enhance immunity,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should consider consulting with a health care professional to determine their specific needs and the appropriate supplements for them.\u201d  He also said consistent physical activity and exercise like a brisk walk or home workout could strengthen the immune system. Varner added that seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night is a \u201cvital aspect of maintaining a strong immune system.\u201d  He also pointed to drinking plenty of water to help \u201cwith the production of white and red blood cell lines.\u201d Morgan said these concerns of Covid would be minimized if the population had, en masse, taken the vaccine options to achieve herd immunity, which is when a dominant faction of the population becomes immune to a disease. \u201cThis became a political football \u2026 and science didn\u2019t have a voice or very weakened voice, a soft voice,\u201d she said. \u201cScience wasn\u2019t ready for a virus in the era of social media, which took over the narrative of what was going on with Covid instead of the voices of the doctors. Everyone was spreading all kinds of theories \u2014 while the disease spread.\u201d  Varner said the messaging to Black people on the harms of multiple infections \u2014 as well as the importance of getting the vaccinations \u2014 has to change. \u201cIt has been consistently clear that when you send a message through people who look like the person you\u2019re trying to capture, the message goes through easier, is accepted better,\u201d Varner said. \u201cThe messaging has not changed at all. And there does not appear to be a focused effort to reach Black folks who don\u2019t have easy access to Wi-Fi or people who may not have as much access to true medical knowledge. All of this makes us more vulnerable.\u201d  For more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter. Curtis Bunn is an Atlanta-based journalist for NBC BLK who writes about race. ",

        "title": "No, Skittles aren't banned in California",
        "content": "Will Skittles no longer be sold in California? That\u2019s the question that\u2019s on Californians\u2019 minds after a bill was recently passed in the state that aims to change some of the ingredients found in America\u2019s most popular candies and snacks. These four ingredients are brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and red dye No. 3. Since titanium dioxide, an ingredient in Skittles, was originally included in the bill, many people believed that the candy would be banned in California. But, as it turns out, titanium dioxide was dropped from the ban, making Skittles exempt from the changes. And since Skittles don\u2019t have any of the other four ingredients listed above in them, it\u2019s safe to say the candy will be safe from any major changes \u2014 for now. In fact, when Jesse Gabriel, a Democratic assembly member from Woodland Hills, California, introduced legislation, called Assembly Bill (AB) 418, that would ban the sale of processed foods in California containing certain chemicals he claimed were dangerous and toxic, it quickly became known as the \u201cSkittles ban,\u201d which has now become a misnomer. In response to AB418, TODAY.com reached out to Mars, the makers of Skittles, who referred us to the National Confectioners Association, as the McLean, Virginia candy conglomerate is one of the associations\u2019 biggest member companies. In a statement, the Association told TODAY.com that it \u201cstrongly\u201d opposes AB418. \u201cChocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. We strongly oppose AB418 because there is no evidence to support banning the ingredients listed in the bill,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe ingredients that would be banned under this proposal have all been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA\u2019s strictest safety standards,\u201d it continues. As for Gabriel, he tells TODAY.com he doesn\u2019t want to ban Skittles, he just wants to make American treats less \u201cdangerous\u201d to eat. \u201cThe idea here is for these companies to make minor modifications to their recipes so that these products don\u2019t include dangerous and toxic chemicals,\u201d he said. \u201cSkittles and many other brands have already made changes to their recipes in the European Union, the UK, and other nations where these chemicals are banned. We simply want them to do the same thing in the United States.\u201d Skittles may be off the hook for now, but there are still up to 12,000 products \u2014 like Peeps, which contains red dye No. 3 \u2014 that could be impacted by AB418. But just because an ingredient gets banned doesn\u2019t mean an entire product will be, too. The bill won\u2019t go into effect until 2027, which gives brands time to change their recipe rather than decide not to sell their product in an entire state. ",

        "content": "Cleveland Browns tight end David Njoku revealed Wednesday that he suffered serious facial injuries in a home fire pit accident and wants to raise money for burn victims and research. In statements posted by the American Burn Association and on his own social media, the 27-year-old New Jersey native launched a merchandise brand, \"Withstand,\" to generate those funds. \"I want to use my platform to help bring awareness to an all too common issue and shed some positive light on an otherwise unfortunate incident,\" Njoku said. The accident happened on Sept. 29 in Cleveland, but Njoku still played in the Browns' Week 4 game against the Baltimore Ravens just two days later, said Brandon Austin, co-founder of the player's merchandise promoter Millions. Njoku showed up to the stadium for that Oct. 1 game wearing a full mask over his face. Browns wide receiver Amari Cooper said he admired his teammate for playing through what must have been excruciating pain. \"It was crazy. I was just like, how the heck did he do this?\" Cooper told reporters Thursday. \"Just putting the helmet on ... imagine getting tackled, your helmet (is) always coming down, you're sweating, it was a lot, it was lot he had to deal with. I commend him for that.\" Njoku has since posted a picture of himself without the mask, revealing extensive burns. The fundraising merch includes T-shirts with images of Njoku in that mask showing up for the Ravens-Browns game. \"I understand firsthand how suddenly life can change due to a burn injury,\" Njoku said in a statement released by the American Burn Association. The player thanked doctors at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, saying the medical staff there was \"instrumental in my recovery, and I am forever grateful for their expertise and care.\" The Browns were off last week and return to action Sunday, at home, against the 5-0 San Francisco 49ers. \"We are grateful to have a dedicated athlete like David Njoku show support as we work to bring attention to the critical issues surrounding burn injuries,\" American Burn Association Chief Executive Kimberly Hoarle said. \"His willingness to turn a personal setback into an opportunity for positive change is truly commendable. Together, we hope to increase burn prevention efforts and make a lasting impact on burn survivors and their families.\" David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Paxlovid may reduce the chance of long Covid. Why don't doctors prescribe it more?",
        "content": "A consensus has emerged among experts who study and treat long Covid: Paxlovid seems to reduce the risk of lingering symptoms among those eligible to take it. The idea is intuitive, experts say. Paxlovid prevents the coronavirus from replicating, so researchers think it may also reduce the risk of an infection causing inflammation or organ damage, which in turn can lead to chronic illness. Clinical observations and a large study published in March support that theory. Among the 282,000 people in the study who were eligible for Paxlovid, the drug was associated with a 26% lower risk of long Covid.  \u201cResearch definitely backs up that it helps prevent lingering symptoms \u2014 it helps prevent long Covid,\u201d said Ashley Drapeau, director of the Long Covid Clinic at the GW Center for Integrative Medicine. Some patients who took Paxlovid during their illness also seem to have less severe long Covid symptoms overall than those who did not, according to Drapeau.  But doctors who treat people for active Covid infections say they aren\u2019t widely prescribing Paxlovid, since the medication interacts with several common drugs and is only approved for people vulnerable to severe illness \u2014 older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. Data from the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System indicates that just 30% of patients who qualify for Paxlovid are being prescribed it, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the system\u2019s chief of research and development.  Research from Helix, a genomic data company, similarly showed that around one-third of nonhospitalized adults at risk of severe Covid were prescribed an antiviral from February to June.  \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that people are not prescribing it enough, especially going into the winter season,\u201d said Al-Aly, who authored the March study. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like when a vaccine is available and people are not using it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really, profoundly sad.\u201d Reta Greenier, a 61-year-old special education teacher in Saint David, Maine, said she asked her doctor for Paxlovid shortly after testing positive for Covid in August 2022. At the time, she said, she had a cough, a slight fever and fatigue. \u201cI said, \u2018I heard there\u2019s a medicine out there now that you can take that will make this less severe,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about long Covid at that point. In fact, I don\u2019t think I knew about it at all.\u201d But Greenier\u2019s doctor told her he didn\u2019t know enough about Paxlovid to feel comfortable writing her a prescription, she said, despite several factors that made her eligible: her age, weight and a history of asthma. Her doctor did not respond to a request for comment. Since then, Greenier said, she has had long Covid symptoms including painful constipation and a combination of dizziness and an elevated heart rate that makes her feel like she might pass out. In June, she said, she called her attorney\u2019s office and asked to update her will. \u201cI thought I was dying,\u201d she said. Greenier said she can only work part-time now, and wonders whether she would be back full-time if she had taken Paxlovid. Drapeau said many of her long Covid patients report that they weren\u2019t offered Paxlovid or were told by their health care provider that they didn\u2019t need it.  \u201cMany of my patients come to me and say, \u2018If only I had taken the Paxlovid \u2026\u2019\u201d she said. Drapeau said doctors probably don\u2019t consider long Covid as a primary risk factor when deciding whether to prescribe Paxlovid. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking, \u2018How can I prevent this person from being in the hospital?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cVersus, \u2018How can I prevent them having lingering symptoms that are going to cause major debility in their life?\u2019\u201d Doctors, for their part, cite a few other reasons: Paxlovid interacts negatively with some anti-seizure and heart medications, as well as certain drugs that lower blood pressure or cholesterol. The medication can also have side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea and a metallic taste in the mouth.  Doctors also weigh how severe a person\u2019s symptoms were the last time they got Covid, if this is not their first infection. \u201cIn general, if you had mild symptoms the first time, you\u2019re probably going to have mild symptoms again, and Paxlovid often makes people feel worse,\u201d said Dr. Geoffrey Mount Varner, an emergency room physician in Virginia and Maryland.  To a lesser extent, doctors see Paxlovid\u2019s potential \u201crebound\u201d effect as a deterrent as well. A small study found that less than 1% of Covid patients saw their symptoms come back one to two weeks after taking Paxlovid. Other research that\u2019s yet to be peer-reviewed found that 6% of a group of 11,300 Covid patients saw symptoms rebound in the month after they took the medication. But Al-Aly said concerns about rebounds and side effects are overblown.  \u201cYou may have malaise again or fever, but it\u2019s all in the acute phase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt usually gets better a few days later, and in the long term is inconsequential.\u201d Paxlovid is taken twice daily, in sets of three pills, for five days. It\u2019s the National Institutes of Health\u2019s preferred treatment for mild to moderate Covid and has been approved since December 2021.  At first, doctors touted Paxlovid as a breakthrough: The drug lowered the risk of severe illness and death from Covid by 89% in a clinical trial, and reduced the risk of hospitalization by 51% in a real-world study. In the spring and summer of 2022, Paxlovid made up a much larger share of prescriptions filled at pharmacies than it did over the same period this year, according to GoodRx\u2019s prescription tracker. Now, the weekly share of Paxlovid prescriptions is about the same as last October. Some experts think the drug might even improve symptoms for patients who already struggle with long Covid. As the theory goes, Paxlovid may help clear lingering virus or viral proteins in the body that continuously aggravate the immune system. But researchers are still evaluating that application of the drug. The NIH\u2019s RECOVER Initiative is giving people Paxlovid for up to 25 days to see if it improves their long Covid symptoms. The first participant in that study was enrolled in July. Studies at the Yale School of Medicine and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden are also investigating Paxlovid as a potential long Covid treatment. Dr. Benjamin Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, said he recommends Paxlovid for people with long Covid who get reinfected. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple patients report improvement through that process,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if they\u2019re not necessarily high risk, I think there\u2019s a lot of benefit for many of our patients who have significant long Covid symptoms.\u201d Another unanswered question is whether young, healthy people might benefit from Paxlovid. Though doctors don\u2019t have evidence of that yet, Drapeau said there\u2019s reason to believe the drug could reduce the risk of long Covid even for people without underlying risk factors. \u201cIt makes sense to me that we give it to a wider population,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Shipment delays plague Covid vaccine rollout, with some clinics saying they've received nothing",
        "content": "Weeks after the approval of updated Covid vaccines, community health centers across the country say they are still waiting on their doses to arrive. The delays are preventing many vulnerable adults and children from getting vaccinated ahead of a potential winter wave. Cahaba Medical Care, which has 26 community health clinics throughout Alabama, hasn\u2019t received a single shipment of the new Covid vaccines since the rollout began in September, said Veronica Ford, a nursing manager at the center. \u201cWe are actually waiting with bated breath,\u201d Ford said. \u201cWe are checking daily to see if the state has received their supply so that we can get ours.\u201d The clinics, Ford said, treat many patients with underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to severe illness. She\u2019s concerned that people who have already come in to get their annual flu shot won\u2019t return to get the Covid vaccine once the shipments come in.  The shipment delays, experts say, underscore the enduring health disparities based on race and class in the U.S.  Community health centers provide federally funded free or low-cost health services, making them pivotal in providing care to underserved populations, including people with low incomes, undocumented immigrants, and many Black and brown communities. Because the clinics rely on federal funding, they cannot afford to cover the costs of the vaccines on their own. That wasn\u2019t a problem during the pandemic, when the federal government was the one buying and distributing the doses; Ford said that Cahaba, for example, gave about 50,000 Covid vaccinations throughout the pandemic that were supplied by the state and federal government. Now that the government has largely stopped paying, many community health centers have had to rely on programs including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Bridge Access Program, which aims to provide free Covid vaccines to adults without insurance or with limited insurance coverage.  But shipments from that program are delayed, with community health centers facing weekslong wait times for their vaccine orders, according to Vacheria Tutson, the associate vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cI\u2019ve had health centers who have only received 100 vaccines,\u201d Tutson said.  With limited shots on hand, clinics have had to prioritize doses for people who face the highest risk of severe illness, including older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Others will go without until the shipments arrive. \u201cNow that we don\u2019t have that government access, it\u2019s shining the light on how we really can\u2019t afford to vaccinate uninsured and underinsured adults,\u201d said Tutson, who added that she is hoping that the situation will improve within the next two weeks. Luis Borja, 70, of Los Angeles, was turned away last week when he went to get a free Covid vaccine at a local community health center in southern Los Angeles. The clinic, run by St. John\u2019s Community Health, said it didn\u2019t have enough vaccines for everyone who wanted one, citing ongoing shipment delays from the Bridge Access Program.  That meant Borja, who lives below the federal poverty line, was largely out of options: He couldn\u2019t afford to pay out of pocket, and his insurance, Medi-Cal, didn\u2019t cover the cost of the shot at most retail pharmacies. Borja, who is originally from El Salvador, told NBC News in an interview in Spanish that he felt \u201ca little frustrated.\u201d  Jim Mangia, the president and CEO of St. John\u2019s Community Health, called it \u201ca travesty.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to provide for the communities most in need,\u201d Mangia said. \u201cThe same vaccine disparities seen before the pandemic are rearing their ugly head again.\u201d  Almost 14 million Covid vaccines have been shipped to pharmacies and other locations since they were approved last month, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. A CDC spokesperson said in a statement that the agency \"has been in frequent contact with state health departments and has not been made aware of any system-wide shortages or obstacles to distribution of the updated COVID-19 vaccine to community health centers.\" Community Health Connection, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, only received a third of the vaccine doses it ordered when its shipments arrived this week, according to its CEO Jim McCarthy. The health center requested 100 vials each from three federally funded programs, including the Bridge Access Program.  \u201cWe got 33 in each program,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to find out now, does that mean that there\u2019ll be 33 more tomorrow, or ever?\u201d The center serves more than 20,000 people, many of whom are Latino. McCarthy said challenges with vaccination efforts have long existed in Oklahoma, where vaccine hesitancy has increased as misinformation runs rampant.  McCarthy said that a handful of people, mostly young, have come to the center asking about the new Covid vaccine. About 96% of patients live below the federal poverty line, and many are working individuals who travel back and forth to visit family in Mexico, he said.  When Tulsa schools opened in August, before the new Covid vaccine was available, he said many parents also called the center asking about vaccines for their children. \u201cThere were a lot of calls at that point in time about, \u2018OK, our kids are going back to school \u2014 they possibly get exposed more, what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd of course, we didn\u2019t have the vaccine.\u201d Other centers are facing a different problem: People don\u2019t want to be vaccinated.  The Life Health Center in Wilmington, Delaware, which primarily serves Black patients, hasn\u2019t received any shipments of the updated vaccine, said Sharon Farrell, a primary pediatric nurse practitioner at the clinic.  Farrell said she recently ordered 200 doses: 100 for children under 12 and 100 for children and adults ages 12 and up. The doses, she said, should arrive next week.  \u201cI\u2019ve never not gotten the order that I asked for, but we asked for very low numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see, I guess.\u201d But for Farrell, the problem is less about vaccine supply and more about people\u2019s willingness to get it. The center hasn\u2019t had to turn anyone away yet, because no one has come in to get the vaccine.  Farrell said that feelings of mistrust in federal government regulations and vaccine mandates are not uncommon among Black and brown patients. These groups have historically been mistreated and medically abused in the past, she said.  It\u2019s a similar story in parts of Pennsylvania, where the vaccine rollout has also been slower than expected.  The Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers, which represents clinics across the state that serve an estimated 1 million people a year, received just 900 Covid vaccines so far, according to Eric Kiehl, the organization\u2019s director of policy and partnership.  While the state Health Department has prioritized getting vaccines to health centers with a larger uninsured population, health centers that serve fewer uninsured patients \u201care probably still on the waitlist to get some vaccine,\u201d Kiehl said. \u201cOur Department of Health is not getting the amount of vaccine that they had anticipated, or at least as quickly as they thought,\u201d Kiehl said. \u201cBut, we have not been hearing a lot from our health centers that they have patients banging on their doors to get access to the vaccine.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza \u2014 Om Hamza Mesleh, 45, was searching desperately for her son when she saw a young man carrying a body draped in bloodied white plastic.  \u201cThis is Hamza!\u201d he shouted.  Panting, Om Hamza, a common honorific in Arabic for matriarchs that translates to \u201cmother of Hamza,\u201d rushed to see whether it was, indeed, her lost son.  She couldn\u2019t hold back her tears when she saw his face. \u201cMy children were playing in front of me inside the house. Suddenly, the floors above my head collapsed, and I could not find my children. I do not know how I got out. I looked for my children but did not find them,\u201d Mesleh said.  After Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Saturday, Israeli airstrikes have reduced entire neighborhoods in Gaza, including hospitals, to soot. The remaining clinics and emergency units have been operating without power and supplies. Follow along for live coverage \u201cOur hospitals are flooded with patients and injured people, and we have to deal with casualties that are arriving on a daily basis at our emergency department,\u201d Marwan Abu Seeds, the deputy director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, said as ambulances brought in one casualty after another.  On Saturday, Hamas \u2014 a militant organization that is one of the two major political groups in the Palestinian territories and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the European Union and other countries \u2014 launched a terrorist attack via land, air and sea that killed at least 1,200 people in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the terrorists raped women and butchered people.  Israel has responded by bombarding the enclave, and on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a \u201cfull siege\u201d of Gaza, blocking food, gas and power into the area. Officials say at least 1,100 people have died in Gaza in bombings since the attack. Now, as Israel's forces prepare for a possible ground invasion, doctors and aid workers say the health care system in Gaza is about to collapse. \u201cThe situation is really catastrophic,\u201d said Sarah Chateau, a Paris-based desk manager for Doctors Without Borders, which has 300 staff members in Gaza. \u201cWe barely can operate in Gaza. The bombing is almost nonstop.\u201d Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah had been in Gaza City for less than 48 hours when he operated on \u201cUnknown Child No. 6.\u201d \u201cHalf his face is missing,\u201d Abu-Sittah told NBC News just moments after he finished the three-hour operation. \u201cThe whole time you\u2019re thinking this is someone\u2019s baby boy. We don\u2019t know his name. You don\u2019t know what happened to the rest of his family. We lost count of people now. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s who.\u201d When he heard about Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, Abu-Sittah, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon based in London, packed his bags and made his way to Gaza, where he has family. \u201cI knew what was about to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew what the Gaza health system is capable of and what it\u2019s not capable of.\u201d Abu-Sittah arrived in Gaza City on Monday. He specializes in treating war injuries, and he has traveled to Gaza to provide care after nearly every major conflict over the last 15 years. After he evacuated to a shelter because rockets were hitting near his family\u2019s home, he made his way to Al-Shifa Hospital. \u201cIt looked like a refugee camp,\u201d he said: It was filled with families taking shelter, he said, hoping it would be safe from bombings. Inside, it was already at capacity, filled with what he called \u201cthe tsunami of wounded.\u201d \u201cThey had already run out or are running out of supplies, especially consumables like gauze, antiseptic, sutures, blades and antibiotic ointment, things you need for burns,\u201d he said. Most of the patients at the hospital are in critical condition, said Seeds, the hospital\u2019s deputy director, adding that many were injured when buildings collapsed and \u201cthe people on the streets have gotten shrapnels.\u201d  Right now, there are so many people with serious injuries that others with lesser injuries are being forced to wait. Abu-Sittah said delaying care could lead to a higher risk of infection and permanent disability. What has stuck with him most so far are the tiniest patients, the young children who are ending up in hospitals. Half of the Palestinians living in Gaza are younger than 19.  Gaza has the highest percentage of pediatric war injuries in the world, said Abu-Sittah, who wrote a textbook on the topic. \u201cThis is the worst place to be a child,\u201d he said. At the Doctors Without Borders clinic, all of the patients were children 10 to 14 years old, Ayman Al-Djaroucha, the group\u2019s project coordinator in Gaza, said in an email. \u201cThe majority of the injured in Gaza are women and children, since they are the ones who are most often in the houses that get destroyed in the airstrikes,\u201d Al-Djaroucha said.  Doctors and aid workers say health care in Gaza was already at a crisis point before the war started. The tiny enclave regularly faces shortages of medical supplies and drugs. Cancer patients, for example, must leave Gaza for treatments like radiation \u2014 and leaving requires special permits and permission from the Israeli government, according to humanitarian groups. Dr. Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based pulmonary and critical care specialist who runs the nonprofit organization MedGlobal, said he was supposed to go to Gaza next week. The organization sends teams of physicians to countries in need. Sahloul said that last week, before the war started, there was already an urgent call for dialysis supplies. Now, with no supplies getting into the area, he estimated that Gaza will completely run out in two to three days. \u201cPatients with dialysis, they will stop getting treatment, and they will die,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter one week, if you are a renal failure patient, you will die.\u201d Hospitals across the Gaza Strip have been operating mostly on diesel generators, with electricity available for only three to four hours a day.  But Gaza\u2019s Energy Ministry spokesman, Muhammad Thait, said that the energy plant stopped working Wednesday after it ran out of fuel and that there was no alternative electricity source left in Gaza. Seeds said \u201cwe are in bad need of fuel\u201d at Al-Shifa.  That left 2.2 million Gaza residents with only generators as sources for power, and the diesel to operate them is in acute shortage. The World Health Organization said Tuesday it is expected that fuel will run out in a matter of days. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of people dying unnecessarily and a lot of mental health trauma among providers, because they cannot save everyone,\u201d Sahloul said. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general met Tuesday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who agreed to facilitate a delivery of health and humanitarian supplies through the country\u2019s border crossing into Gaza, provided Israel allows safe passage. The WHO said in a statement: \u201cThey have exhausted the supplies WHO pre-positioned before the escalation. The life-saving health response is now dependent on getting new supplies and fuel to health care facilities as fast as possible.\u201d    Mesleh, the mother, said about 70 people were inside the building she lives in at the time of the attack. \u201cMy other son is wounded, and my daughter is, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are all in the hospital.\u201d Much of the medical staff has not left the hospital for days, working around the clock to treat the wounded, like Mesleh\u2019s children. With ambulances and nearby buildings coming under aerial attack, emergency staff members said accessing services was becoming a gamble for patients. \u201cHe is a martyr, by the will of God, he is a martyr,\u201d said Hamza\u2019s father, Mohamed Mesleh, who then helped lift his son\u2019s body into an ambulance.  It arrived at Al-Shifa Hospital, where babies and their mothers sat on the crowded floor, waiting for their loved ones to be treated. At area clinics, like the makeshift Doctors Without Borders clinic in Gaza City, emergency doctors treated dozens of victims all day long. \u201cTwo days ago, we had a young patient, about 8 or 9 years old, who was in the vicinity of an aerial strike,\u201d Dr. Justin Dalby said. \u201cHe sustained severe burns across the face, the chest and upper arms on both sides of his body.\u201d He said the boy had nowhere to go after an airstrike flattened his building. Patients\u2019 recoveries could take months, he said, with rampant risks of infection and no clean water. Leo Cans, the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in Palestinian Territories, which provided medical aid and surgical teams at Gaza hospitals, said: \u201cOne of the hospitals we support was hit by an airstrike and damaged. Another airstrike destroyed an ambulance carrying the wounded, right in front of the hospital where we work.\u201d The Gaza City clinic opened Sunday, and doctors like Dalby were performing highly complicated operations under some of the worst conditions they had ever seen, they said. While patients try to recover in previously unfathomable conditions, their loved ones are finding that their own roads to recovery are also just beginning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where to go now. Our homes are destroyed, and there is no shelter in which we can stay. We have no involvement in Hamas, Fatah or any other organization,\u201d said Mesleh, the mother, referring to the Palestinian authorities in Gaza and the West Bank. \u201cSuddenly, the building fell on my head and my children\u2019s heads.\u201d Wajjeh Abu Zarifa is an NBC News producer in Gaza.

        "title": "Aaron Rodgers challenges Travis Kelce to Covid vaccine debate",
        "content": "Sidelined New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers challenged Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce on Tuesday to debate the effectiveness of Covid vaccines. The pro football standouts have been trading barbs since Rodgers mocked Kelce for partnering with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in a campaign to encourage people to get their flu shots and Covid vaccinations. Rodgers mocked Kelce, calling him \"Mr. Pfizer,\" before fans fired back at him, pointing out that he is \"Mr. Johnson & Johnson\" playing for the Jets \u2014 owned by Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson. \u201cWho knew I\u2019d get into the vax wars with Aaron Rodgers, man?\" Kelce joked with reporters last week. \"Mr. Pfizer versus the Johnson & Johnson family over there.\u201d Rodgers didn't mention Kelce's name in his weekly check-in on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Tuesday, but he clearly had him in mind when he referred to the ongoing debate. \"I made a tiny little joke about a guy shilling for a potentially ... corrupt company and everybody kind of loses their minds,\" Rodgers said. \"Mr. Pfizer said he didn't think he would be in vax war with me. This ain't a war, homie. This is just conversation,\" the amused Rodgers continued. \"But if you want to have some sort of duel, debate, have me on the podcast, come on the show, let us have a conversation.\" Rodgers' bit included talk of proxy fighters in a comparison to the movie \"John Wick: Chapter 4.\" \"I'm going to take my man RFK Jr., independent, and he can have, you know, Tony Fauci or some other pharmacrat and we can have a conversation about this,\" Rodgers said, mentioning independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist. In 2021, only months after Covid vaccines were first rolled out, Rodgers admitted to having made \"misleading\" comments by saying he was \"immunized\" against Covid-19, which was taken to mean he had been vaccinated. Rodgers eventually disclosed he hadn't been vaccinated but had instead taken ivermectin, a drug typically used on livestock and pushed by podcaster Joe Rogan. Both Covid and flu shots are overwhelmingly safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends an annual flu shot for everyone ages 6 months and older \u2014 ideally in October, when flu cases typically start to rise. People ages 6 months and older who haven\u2019t gotten Covid shots within the last two months should also get updated Covid vaccinations this fall, according to the CDC. Kelce stood by his endorsement of vaccination talking to reporters last week. \"I got it because of keeping myself safe, keeping my family safe, the people in this building, so yeah, I stand by it 1,000%\" he said. \"I\u2019m fully comfortable with him calling me Mr. Pfizer.\u201d Before this recent vaccine debate, Kelce had also been in the national spotlight because of his increasingly public relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift. She attended his Chiefs games on Sept. 24 and Oct. 1, drawing many Swifties to football for the first time. And in the process the pair have increasingly become the targets of conservative vitriol. For years, Swift has urged her young fans to register to vote. David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Three female doctors sue L.A. County for allegedly ignoring complaints about abusive surgeon",
        "content": "Three leading female physicians at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California, filed suit last week against Los Angeles County, the overseer of the giant teaching hospital, contending that its management ignored years of complaints alleging sexual harassment, retaliation and discriminatory behavior by Dr. Louis Kwong, who until recently was the head of the facility\u2019s orthopedics department. Kwong\u2019s activities created a toxic work environment and put patients at risk, the physicians said in their suits, contending in one that he committed sexual misconduct on unconscious patients in the operating room, delayed acute surgery for county residents to perform elective procedures and once demanded that an operating room television on which a patient\u2019s operation was being monitored be switched to a baseball game he wanted to watch during the operation. They say he also wore a gun at the hospital, including in the operating room; Kwong is a volunteer deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County, the county confirmed. Misogyny permeated the facility, according to the suits. One doctor said she was asked to step down from her position to make way for a younger, less experienced male applicant. The department needed to give \u201ca talented guy a chance before you turn into a pumpkin,\u201d her lawsuit says she was told. The plaintiffs are Drs. Haleh Badkoobehi and Jennifer Hsu \u2014 who are orthopedic surgeons \u2014 and Dr. Madonna Fernandez-Frackelton, a former longtime program director of emergency medicine at the facility. In their lawsuits, they say that they were demoted or otherwise retaliated against when they complained about Kwong\u2019s behavior and that hospital administrators ignored written and verbal complaints about him for years. Harbor-UCLA Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Torrance with 576 beds that serves a largely middle- and lower-income population. Los Angeles County\u2019s Department of Health Services operates the hospital, which has a highly ranked residency program affiliated with UCLA Medical School. The lawsuits involving Harbor-UCLA Medical Center follow other incidents at health care facilities affiliated with prestigious universities where complaints about doctors were allegedly dismissed for years. Before they sued, all three physicians tried other remedies over many years, according to their suits, including filing grievances with the county and complaining to superiors. They say that the problems persist and in one of the actions say that they are suing to \u201chelp create a safer and more tolerant atmosphere\u201d at the facility \u201cfor future patients, women and other targeted groups.\u201d \u201cThey rely on us being too ashamed and terrified for our careers to come forward,\u201d Badkoobehi said in an interview. Kwong was placed on administrative leave in March 2022, and the county hired a law firm, Sheppard Mullin, to investigate the allegations. The investigator at the law firm declined to comment. While the investigation is ongoing and Kwong is on leave, he has earned as much as $1 million in pay and benefits in a year, according to the website of Transparent California, a public employees pay and pension database. A graduate of UCLA Medical School, Kwong has worked at Harbor-UCLA since 1990, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 shows. He did not respond to an email and a voicemail seeking comment. In late June, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the independent organization overseeing accreditation of post-medical school residency and fellowship programs, placed Harbor-UCLA on probation, according to its website. The move followed a site visit in April by the organization after Fernandez-Frackelton and all 64 of her emergency department residents submitted a complaint to the overseer about the toxic work environment in the hospital\u2019s orthopedics unit, previously led by Kwong. After she complained to her superiors about the toxic environment her residents encountered in the orthopedics unit, Fernandez-Frackelton, 53, was removed as program director of the emergency department. She had led it for 12 years, but in June, a younger, less experienced man replaced her, according to her lawsuit. Fernandez-Frackelton was told the department needed to give \u201ca talented guy a chance before you turn into a pumpkin,\u201d the lawsuit says.   A representative of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services declined to comment on the litigation but said in a statement, \u201cHarbor-UCLA Medical Center is committed to the health and safety of our patients and staff. These allegations of misconduct are being thoroughly investigated and, if substantiated, will result in appropriate corrective actions. We deeply value the trust the public places in our dedicated medical and patient care teams. Safeguarding patient care is our highest priority.\u201d In another recent incident involving UCLA, James Heaps, a longtime gynecologist at UCLA\u2019s student health center and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, was sentenced in April to 11 years in prison for sexually abusing female patients for years. UCLA paid $700 million to settle hundreds of complaints from Heaps\u2019 patients, some of whom said the university ignored their complaints. In June, Robert Hadden, a longtime former OB-GYN at Columbia University in New York, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for molesting patients over decades. An additional 300 Hadden patients sued Columbia this month, saying it had covered up for him. And last year, the University of Michigan paid $490 million to more than 1,000 students who said they were abused by Robert Anderson, a sports doctor. Carol Gillam represents the three physicians in their lawsuits against Los Angeles County. In a statement, she said: \u201cThis story is unfortunately an all too familiar one about powerful doctors at prestigious teaching hospitals abusing patients and flaunting their own privileges and connections to the men who are supposed to supervise, discipline and remove them.\u201d Among the incidents involving patient abuse at Harbor-UCLA, according to one of the lawsuits, is an episode when Badkoobehi saw Kwong \u201cengaged in \u2018finger banging\u2019 of surgical hip wounds\u201d on an unconscious patient while making sexual sounds and saying he was \u201cfinding the G-spot.\u201d In another, Kwong allegedly undraped an anesthetized patient in front of Badkoobehi \u201cto look at his penis after being told it was large.\u201d Hsu also alleges that Kwong regularly delayed urgent trauma operations so he could perform elective, nonacute operations. \u201cThere were definitely times where we had to move other multiple patients around to accommodate his elective cases,\u201d Hsu said in an interview, adding that the delays could extend to more than a week. That was reported to management, but Kwong faced no repercussions, the suit says. Badkoobehi provided texts to NBC News showing that in 2016 the hospital\u2019s CEO confirmed that the allegations against Kwong were \u201cvery serious\u201d and that the facility\u2019s risk management unit was aware and involved. Nothing changed, the surgeon said. All three of the doctors say they received lower pay than their male counterparts at the facility.  The suits describe misogynistic incidents at the hospital; one example: When Kwong asked other Harbor-UCLA employees, \u201cWho wants to take body shots off Dr. Badkoobehi?\u201d Residents in the Harbor-UCLA program were also encouraged to attend strip clubs together, one lawsuit says, with a female resident saying \u201cshe was taken to the strip club from work without her consent.\u201d At a lecture by Kwong that students and residents were required to attend, it says, Kwong asked Badkoobehi and other women there: \u201cWhat sexual position causes a penile fracture?\u201d He kept pushing for a response, the lawsuit says, until he got the answer: \u201creverse cowgirl.\u201d As director of the orthopedics residency program at the hospital, Kwong attended faculty meetings to select candidates. At one point, one lawsuit says, Kwong held up pictures of two Black male candidates, asking: \u201cDo you want Brother X or Brother Y?\u201d Since 2016, Kwong has received over $800,000 in payments from medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, more than the mean payments received by other physicians in the specialty, according to records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He has also received $665,000 in associated research funding from pharmaceutical and medical device makers on a project for which he is a principal investigator. \u201cI love working with the patients,\u201d Fernandez-Frackelton told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s an underserved population, the working poor in Los Angeles, and really satisfying and rewarding to care for them. But our system should respond to complaints about the inadequate care they are getting.\u201d   Gretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit. A former stockbroker, she won the Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for her \"trenchant and incisive\" reporting on Wall Street. ",

        "title": "California becomes the first state to ban four chemicals in food, including red dye No. 3",
        "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that bans four food additives linked to health problems, the first time a state has outlawed chemicals allowed by the Food and Drug Administration. Starting in 2027, California will prohibit red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben after Newsom, a Democrat, signed Assembly Bill 418 into law Saturday. All four ingredients have been made illegal in the European Union and some other parts of the world, but they can be found in commonly sold items in the U.S., such as some brands of orange soda, icing, hamburger rolls, candies and processed foods. The chemicals have been associated with issues from hyperactivity in children to cancer.  Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who introduced the bill with Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a fellow Democrat, said he was \u201celated and deeply grateful\u201d to Newsom for signing it.  \u201cThe state is stepping up to protect people,\u201d he said in a phone interview Tuesday.  The law won\u2019t result in any foods\u2019 being banned from shelves, Gabriel said. Instead, he said, food companies will be required to make \u201creally minor\u201d modifications using alternative ingredients they already use overseas.  \u201cWe have incredible confidence that consumers are still going to be able to enjoy all the products that we know and love here in the United States, just without those harmful chemicals,\u201d he said. The law is likely to have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy health organization that backed the bill. Food and drink manufacturers are unlikely to make versions of their products just for California, and they could tweak the ingredient lists for as many as 12,000 products sold nationwide, the organization estimated, based on its food database. The four additives serve a variety of purposes \u2014 from making food look more enticing to helping preserve it longer. The FDA has long banned red dye No. 3 from cosmetics because studies show it causes cancer in lab animals in high doses. Yet the artificial color, which is derived from petroleum, is still used to give foods and medicines a bright red hue. Studies have also indicated that artificial food dyes are associated with behavioral problems in children, including hyperactivity; the FDA maintains there is no evidence of a causal relationship for children in the general population who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with behavioral disorders.  Potassium bromate, a flour additive that helps bread rise higher, has also been linked to cancer in lab animals. Brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier in citrus drinks, has been tied to behavioral and reproductive issues in lab animals, among other health concerns. And propylparaben, a preservative in cosmetics and food, is believed to mimic estrogen, potentially acting as an endocrine disruptor. Newsom said in a statement that delaying implementing the law until 2027 should give brands adequate time to revise their recipes and that it was a positive step until the FDA \u201cestablishes national updated safety levels for these additives.\u201d  The FDA says it routinely monitors scientific information on ingredients. In an email, a spokesperson said the agency \u201cevaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill.\u201d The FDA stands by the use of the ingredients, the spokesperson said, though after it reviewed data published last year, it is working on a proposed rule to remove the authorization of brominated vegetable oil. Such reviews can take years, Gabriel said, adding that he hoped the new law would prompt faster change. \u201cThe first and foremost objective is to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a secondary objective here was to make a point and to send a message to the FDA and to folks in Washington, D.C., about just how badly the FDA process is broken.\u201d The National Confectioners Association, a trade association for candymakers, slammed the California law.  \u201cGovernor Newsom\u2019s approval of this bill will undermine consumer confidence and create confusion around food safety,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThis law replaces a uniform national food safety system with a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements created by legislative fiat that will increase food costs.\u201d Elizabeth Chuck is a reporter for NBC News who focuses on health and mental health, particularly issues that affect women and children.

        "title": "Psychiatrist who once ran Arkansas State Medical Board arrested for alleged Medicaid fraud",
        "content": "An Arkansas psychiatrist who once ran the state\u2019s medical board has been arrested for alleged Medicaid fraud. An affidavit filed with the arrest warrant and obtained by NBC News alleges that Dr. Brian Hyatt billed Medicaid for its most expensive billing codes while he was running the locked behavioral unit at the Northwest Medical Center in Springdale, even though investigators concluded that he was rarely in the building. Hyatt was arrested by the Rogers Police Department on Monday. In a statement after arrest, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said, \"My office has made arrangements with Dr. Hyatt\u2019s attorney for Hyatt to appear in Pulaski County for a bail hearing later this month.\" More than 40 former patients have also accused Hyatt in civil lawsuits of having imprisoned them against their will while he was running the locked behavioral health unit from February 2018 through May 2022.  Hyatt\u2019s contract with the hospital was abruptly terminated when Medicaid fraud allegations first surfaced in May 2022. He stepped down as chairman of the State Medical Board this March and then resigned from the board altogether in May. The affidavit lays out an alleged scheme in which Hyatt is accused of billing Medicaid for treatment he didn\u2019t provide. The affidavit is signed by a Medicaid fraud control unit investigator for Attorney General Griffin. A confidential informant told the attorney general\u2019s office that Hyatt had \u201clittle or no contact with patients\u201d and \u201cdid not want the patients to know his name,\u201d according to the affidavit. The confidential informant also told investigators that Hyatt\u2019s unit allegedly used \u201cchemical restraints when patients were not an imminent danger to themselves or others.\u201d Aaron Cash, a lawyer representing dozens of clients who have sued Hyatt alleging wrongful imprisonment, told NBC News, \u201cOur clients were relieved to learn the news about Dr. Hyatt\u2019s arrest warrant and are thankful to Attorney General Tim Griffin and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their work in helping find justice for the many other victims of his scheme.\u201d Hyatt\u2019s civil attorney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by phone or email, and a criminal defense attorney wasn\u2019t listed in court filings. There was no response to an email and a voice mail message sent to his practice. An attorney for Hyatt had told Arkansas Business in August that Hyatt denied the allegations made against him and maintained his innocence: \u201cDespite his career as an outstanding clinician, Dr. Hyatt has become the target of a vicious, orchestrated attack on his character and service. He looks forward to defending himself in court.\u201d In July, Northwest Medical Center told NBC News, \u201cWe believe hospital personnel complied in all respects with Arkansas law, which heavily relies on the treating physician\u2019s assessment of the patient, including in decisions related to involuntary commitment.\"  When Hyatt began running the unit in 2018, there were 29 beds. By last year, he had expanded it to 77 beds. In an interview with state investigators, Hyatt said of his interactions with patients, \u201cI would see everybody and look in on everybody,\u201d according to the affidavit. But the attorney general\u2019s office used video from 40 security cameras to track Hyatt\u2019s time over 46 days in the unit and found that he spent 70% of his time in his office and just less than 1% seeing patients, or less than 10 minutes. In April, the hospital agreed to pay back $1.1 million in a settlement with the attorney general\u2019s office. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Western District of Arkansas and the Health and Human Services inspector general\u2019s office previously confirmed an ongoing investigation of Hyatt. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided his office\u2019s practice in May. Laura Strickler is a senior investigative producer and reporter for NBC News. She is based in Washington. ",

        "title": "New state laws will make it more difficult for schools to teach LGBTQ material in sex education",
        "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 In fifth grade, Stella Gage\u2019s class watched a video about puberty. In ninth grade, a few sessions of her health class were dedicated to the risks of sexual behaviors. That was the extent of her sex education in school. At no point was there any content that felt especially relevant to her identity as a queer teenager. To fill the gaps, she turned mostly to social media. \u201cMy parents were mostly absent, my peers were not mature enough, and I didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to,\u201d said Gage, who is now a sophomore at Wichita State University in Kansas. Many LGBTQ students say they have not felt represented in sex education classes. To learn about their identities and how to build healthy, safe relationships, they often have had to look elsewhere. As lawmakers in some states limit what can be taught about sex and gender, it will be that much more difficult for those students to come by inclusive material in classrooms. New laws targeting LGBTQ people have been proliferating in GOP-led states. Some elected officials, including candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, have been pushing to remove LGBTQ content from classrooms. Sex education curriculum varies widely. Some groups including Planned Parenthood have called for sex education to be inclusive of LGBTQ students, but some states outright forbid such an approach. The penal code in Texas, for one, still says curriculum developed by the Department of State Health Services must say homosexuality is not acceptable and is a criminal offense, even though such language was deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003. Attempts in the Legislature to remove that line from state law have failed. In practice, LGBTQ students say they have looked elsewhere for sex education. Some described watching their peers turn to pornography, and others said they watched videos on YouTube about how to tell if someone is gay and how to flirt with people of the same sex. Gage grew up in Oklahoma before her military family relocated and she spent her eighth and ninth grade years in a U.S. Department of Defense school in the Netherlands. She then finished high school in Kansas, where she began to recognize she wasn\u2019t attracted only to men. Not seeing a safe outlet at her high school to explore who she was, she went online to research for herself the history of the LGBTQ community in the U.S. \u201cI started to realize there is a huge portion of our history that is conveniently left out. But that history is important to queer youth,\u201d she said. She never really questioned gender or social norms, she said, until she started to learn about discrimination others have faced throughout history. \u201cWe have such rigid boxes that we expect people to fit into. If you didn\u2019t fit, you were called slurs. I wasn\u2019t really aware that if you strayed from those norms that people would feel you were attacking their way of life.\u201d Still, the internet contains vast amounts of false information. Some advocates worry students turning to the internet to fill gaps in sex education will struggle to find their way through the morass. \u201cAny time you have a political controversy, there is a greater potential for a lot more disinformation to be generated,\u201d said Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design at the News Literacy Project. When schools address sexuality, it is often in the context of disease prevention or anti-bullying programs. School can be a difficult place if your identity is seen only in such negative ways, said Tim\u2019m West, a former teacher and now executive director of the LGBTQ Institute at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. West can relate: He grew up in Arkansas as a queer Black kid and preacher\u2019s son and was constantly made to feel ashamed. \u201cWhat if you are a boy in high school that knows you like boys, and you sit in a divided room and listen to a teacher explain how not to have sex with girls. You would be sitting there rolling your eyes, because that is not your issue. But you also haven\u2019t been given any instructions on how to protect yourself should you experiment with a person of the same gender,\u201d West said. Students need more applicable sex education regardless of their gender identity or expression, said Gage, who volunteers with a youth justice advocacy group and is also president of the Planned Parenthood Generation Action Chapter at Wichita State. \u201cWe all have to make large decisions for ourselves about our sexuality and reproductive health. Those decisions should be grounded in knowledge,\u201d she said. Growing up in Washington, D.C., Ashton Gerber had more sex education classes than most. But Gerber, who is transgender, said the lessons weren\u2019t all that applicable to their experience. \u201cEven if you can have sex education every day of the year, there is always going to be something that gets left out,\u201d said Gerber, who is a student at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Gerber said educators should point students to trusted online resources so they can do their own research. Not knowing who you are is a horrible feeling many LGBTQ students wrestle with, Gage said. But equally horrible is not feeling accepted once you do understand your sexual identity. \u201cHad I known then what I know now, I would have felt safe and confident coming out sooner,\u201d Gage said. \u201cNo one should feel like they don\u2019t understand themselves because we are forced to conformity in a world that doesn\u2019t care. We can all be inclusive.\u201d   ",

        "title": "New heart syndrome identifies link among obesity, diabetes and kidney disease",
        "content": "As more Americans are being diagnosed with multiple chronic health problems at younger ages, for the first time, the American Heart Association is identifying a new medical condition that reflects the strong links among obesity, diabetes and heart and kidney disease. According to an advisory released Monday, the goal in recognizing the condition \u2014 cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or CKM \u2014 is to get earlier diagnosis and treatment for people at high risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. \u201cReducing the pipeline of individuals progressing to heart disease is our primary goal,\u201d said the lead author of the advisory and an accompanying statement, Dr. Chiadi E. Ndumele, the director of obesity and cardiometabolic research in the division of cardiology at Johns Hopkins University.  Right now, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the health consequences of all these conditions interacting and leading to earlier presentations with heart disease,\u201d Ndumele said. Naming and describing CKM are \u201creally a paradigm change.\u201d Increasing evidence shows how metabolic risk factors such as abdominal fat, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar can negatively affect other organs in the body. Dr. Pam R. Taub, a cardiologist, agreed that the new approach may be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in how doctors treat patients.   The development of new medications to treat conditions that are part of the syndrome, such as kidney disease, diabetes and obesity, has resulted in decreases in cardiovascular events and given doctors new insights into the relationship among the different organs, said Taub, a professor of medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine.   \u201cIt\u2019s been eye-opening,\u201d Taub said. CKM takes into account \u201cwhat I call organ cross-talk, in which they are interacting with each other very intricately in the body.\u201d For example, early kidney disease can be detected in a patient\u2019s urine sample. \u201cThe reason this is so important is the drugs you can give the patient will prevent them from progressing to chronic kidney disease,\u201d she said. In general, Taub said, when you look at the organs together, \u201cyou can detect disease early and you\u2019re going to prevent bad cardiovascular outcomes, like heart failure, heart attacks and stroke.\u201d Fortunately, people with the newly defined condition can improve if it\u2019s caught early and treated. \u201cSeveral times in my clinical practice I have seen regression after significant lifestyle changes and weight loss,\u201d Ndumele said. Along with defining the new syndrome, Ndumele and his team devised a system of stages for doctors to identify patients at risk: More than 90% of adults fall on the CKM spectrum, Ndumele estimated, driven mainly by record levels of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in adults and children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 41.9% of adults and 19.7% of children in the U.S. are obese. More than 37 million adults have diabetes. The advisory could encourage doctors \u201cto look at a bigger target,\u201d said Dr. Howard Weintraub, the clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart in New York. That may help with identifying and treating patients before conditions have progressed. It may also persuade patients to see obesity as a health risk, Weintraub said. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing obesity and waist circumference back as a focus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis got a lot of play 15 or 20 years ago, but then it kind of went away.\u201d One big reason, Weintraub said, is there were no medications to treat the condition. When a patient came in with a BMI close to 30 and a hint that the risk of diabetes might be rising, doctors were likely to just \u201cpat the patient on the back, tell them to lay off the french fries, get more exercise and then say, \u2018See you next year,\u2019\u201d he said. The new entity, CKM, may get doctors and patients more engaged earlier. \u201cSo rather than wait till somebody is already advanced by the time they come to medical attention, we can treat them earlier,\u201d Weintraub said. Weintraub worries about the cost of the new drugs and that insurance companies may balk at paying for them, especially for people in the early stages.  Ultimately, the best solution is to reach Americans when they are young and healthier, Weintraub said. \u201cWe need to keep America\u2019s youth a healthy weight and not let their arteries turn into lead pipes by the time they are in their 30s.\u201d Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News.

The rookie was injured on a running play and the medical staff took time to secure his neck with a brace. He was placed on a backboard and onto the back of a cart. Carolina\u2019s players left the sideline to be near their injured teammate and surrounded the cart before Zavala was removed from the field. Zavala gave a thumbs-up while being carted off the field. The Lions left their sideline in a show of support for Zavala, who drew cheers from the crowd as he was taken for further evaluation. The Panthers drafted Zavala in the fourth round out of North Carolina State. Nash Jensen, an undrafted rookie from North Dakota State, filled in for Zavala at left guard. ",

        "title": "People who've had Covid at least 5 times describe how the illness changed with each reinfection",
        "content": "Nearly four years after Covid\u2019s emergence, plenty of people have tested positive at least twice. But an unlucky group has been hit with reinfection after reinfection. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few patients with five infections,\u201d said Dr. Grace McComsey, vice dean for clinical and translational research at Case Western University. \u201cSadly, they were immunized and they still got Covid five times.\u201d Reanna Sunford Clark, a 47-year-old day care teacher in Portland, Oregon, says she has gotten Covid six times. \u201cIt does make me concerned that I have this predisposition to it,\u201d Clark said.  Given that the age group she works with isn\u2019t known for clean hands, Clark added, \u201cit makes sense that I am exposing myself to a more likely source \u2014 but on the flip side of that, I feel like I\u2019ve had it so many times, I should have more immunity than I do.\u201d After her first infection in November 2021 \u2014 which landed her in the ER with shortness of breath \u2014 Clark\u2019s subsequent illnesses mostly brought cold-like symptoms that resolved within three or four days, she said.  \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve gotten it, I\u2019ve had a sore throat,\u201d she added. Clark is one of five people interviewed by NBC News who described what it has been like to get Covid at least five times. All five either tested positive at home, received a positive antibody test later or were diagnosed by a health care provider each time. They provided images of test results, medical records or correspondence with friends or family as verification. Overall, they said, the experiences have left them confused and curious about the reasons for their frequent illnesses.  Three people said their later infections were all less severe than the first \u2014 though there wasn\u2019t necessarily a clear pattern of milder symptoms with each new illness. Even so, having Covid was still mentally and emotionally exhausting each time, they said, since it disrupted their work and time with loved ones. Brenda Keele, a 38-year-old resident of Casper, Wyoming, said her symptoms got worse with each round of Covid. Keele recently endured her fifth and most severe coronavirus infection, which she said caused body aches and trouble breathing. At the height of that illness, she said, Keele could barely walk and felt \u201clike every single one of my lymph nodes in my body is swollen and painful.\u201d  In the two weeks since she stopped testing positive, her symptoms have improved, though she still has lingering congestion, Keele said.  Although each reinfection should theoretically be milder than the previous one for most people, doctors said, cases like Keele\u2019s do happen. McComsey estimated that about 20% to 25% of her patients report that their reinfections are more severe. Keele has chronic heart failure and adrenal insufficiency, so she takes medications that compromise her immune system. Her heart condition has declined over the last year and a half, she said, but doctors aren\u2019t sure if Covid is responsible. Severe reinfections could be more likely if lots of time has elapsed since a person\u2019s last Covid shot or if they were exposed to a high viral load, McComsey said.  Keele was vaccinated but did not get booster shots. The others interviewed each said they got at least one booster after their original vaccines.  Emily, a 36-year-old singer in Brooklyn who asked that her last name be withheld to maintain her privacy, said all five of her infections were relatively mild. But she noticed that her symptoms tended to be more severe if several months had passed since her most recent Covid vaccine.  Emily\u2019s third infection in May 2022 \u2014 six months after her booster shot \u2014 was the worst, she said. \u201cThis was more of a body ache, feverish feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt laid out for about a week.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified more than 2.7 million Covid reinfections from September 2021 to December 2022 across a set of regions containing about 45% of the U.S. population. But because some states stopped tracking reinfections or never recorded them, it\u2019s not clear how common it is to be infected multiple times. Doctors who study Covid say it\u2019s not surprising that some people have gotten Covid more than once a year, given how widely the virus has spread and how frequently cases surge. \u201cThe virus continued to mutate, so it has a way of escaping immunity,\u201d said Dr. Miriam Merad, chair of the Department of Immunology and Immunotherapy at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. There aren\u2019t always easy explanations for why a patient has gotten Covid many times, McComsey said, but a few factors could be at play. The most obvious is that if people are immunocompromised, their immunity from a prior infection is more likely to wane.  Getting long Covid could also make people more prone to reinfection, she added, since it\u2019s associated with inflammation and blood clots. At least 10% of Covid cases have led to long Covid (defined as symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks), though the rate is higher among people who were hospitalized for their infection. Merad, meanwhile, noted that because Covid can trigger inflammation in people with underlying health issues, that may contribute to severe symptoms even if the viral infection isn\u2019t aggressive itself.  Like Clark, Kiah Williams \u2014 a 27-year-old personal trainer in Hemel Hempstead, England \u2014 thinks his work setting exposed him to more Covid than other people, given that his job requires in-person interactions in confined indoor spaces.  Williams said his fourth infection produced just one symptom \u2014 a runny nose \u2014 and his fifth brought only a sore throat.  Even with manageable, mild symptoms, several people said getting Covid five-plus times was mentally exhausting. Each time Williams got sick, he had to take time away from the gym and isolate from his partner. \u201cGetting sick every other month, it really took a toll on my mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cNot being able to even just sit with my partner, just be with her, just talk, because essentially I can\u2019t get her sick, well \u2014 it was just a lonely time.\u201d Makenzie Boyle, a 28-year-old human resources administrator in San Francisco, went to the emergency room when she was infected with Covid for the first time in December 2020 and was diagnosed with pneumonia. A year later, Boyle was diagnosed with diabetes, which her doctor said was an effect of Covid \u2014 research has shown a link between the two conditions. Boyle\u2019s third infection, though mild, exacerbated lingering symptoms from her first illness, such as fatigue and swelling in her extremities. Then after her fifth infection in June, she developed chronic kidney disease and chest pain that hasn\u2019t gone away, she said. (Studies have indicated that Covid can directly infect kidney cells, and consequently contribute to kidney disease.) Boyle\u2019s manifold symptoms, combined with how frequently she has gotten sick, have led her to continue masking in crowded places and ask family members to take Covid tests before they see her.  But those precautions can be isolating. \u201cMost of my peers are spending the weekends at the bar, at the club, out with friends, going to concerts, and I am by and large isolated and alone,\u201d Boyle said. Her boyfriend, she said, is moving out of their shared home because he works in food service and they don\u2019t want to risk exposing her to another infection. Reinfections do bring a new risk of long Covid, McComsey said: Each time someone gets Covid, it introduces another assault to the immune system that can result in long-lasting symptoms. However, Merad said, young, healthy people shouldn\u2019t panic about getting Covid multiple times.  \u201cWe are going to be reinfected, the same way we are reinfected by flu. But the most severe infection was the one that we observed when we were not vaccinated,\u201d she said.  Emily said that after getting Covid five times, she feels less worried about the virus\u2019 threat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay inside to avoid it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just seems like something we live with now.\u201d Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "5 who survived cardiac arrest describe what they saw and heard before reviving",
        "content": "Every year, more than 350,000 people have a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital. Few survive. While many people who have been resuscitated have no memories of the experience, a recent study suggests others recall something, whether it\u2019s a vague sense that people are around them, or more specific dreamlike awareness.  Unlike a heart attack where people are awake and the heart is still painfully beating, those in cardiac arrest are always unconscious. They have no heartbeat or pulse and need CPR urgently. In essence, they have \u201cflat-lined\u201d and are so near death there is no activity on electronic monitors. What a near-death experience is has never really been defined. Researchers have been trying to explore what\u2019s happening when a patient\u2019s heart stops to see if there are themes or patterns of consciousness. \u201cThere is an assumption that because people do not respond to us physically, in other words, when they\u2019re in a coma, that they\u2019re not conscious, and that\u2019s fundamentally flawed,\" said Dr. Sam Parnia, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at NYU Langone Health, and the lead author of the recent study. To find out more about the experiences of the few survivors who have a sense of consciousness during heart-related near-death events, NBC News connected with participants in the NYU Langone research and others from the Cardiac Arrest Survivor Alliance online community, a program of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation, and the Near-Death Experience Research Foundation. They shared what they saw, heard and felt during resuscitation, how their lives changed afterward and what they believe other people should know about death and dying. Greg Kowaleski, a father of three who lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was 47 and playing a pick-up ice hockey game when he collapsed on the rink. Fortunately for Kowaleski, a pediatric cardiologist who is a good friend of his happened to be there, skating for the opposing team. Dr. Jeff Zampi determined that Kowaleski didn\u2019t have a pulse and immediately began chest compressions. Using an automated external defibrillator, or AED, Zampi was able to shock his friend\u2019s heart back into a normal rhythm.  Although the cardiac arrest was in 2021, Kowaleski still recalls the \u201cincredibly vivid\u201d memory he had while Zampi was resuscitating him. Kowaleski found himself boarding an airplane that was completely empty, the blue seats stretching out in front of him. \u201cThe sun is really bright outside, like a beautiful day and I sit down next to the window in my seat, looking out on the tarmac,\u201d he said.  \u201cAs I\u2019m sitting there waiting, I hear somebody call my name,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my friend Jeff.\u201d In the memory, Zampi told him he was on the wrong flight and needed to get off. \u201cI got up and I followed him out of the plane,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then as we\u2019re getting off the plane, boom! I came back. I woke up.\u201d Since then, Kowaleski said he\u2019s struggled a little bit with what exactly the experience meant. \u201cThe place where I went, wherever it was, I will say it was extremely peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever experienced anything so calm, quiet, peaceful.\u201d What he does know is that he doesn\u2019t really fear death anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s not a scary, bad place to go, wherever I was.\u201d  In 2016, Em James Arnold, a parent in New York City, had a cardiac arrest and was revived. Arnold\u2019s girlfriend started CPR, but the resuscitation lasted 90 minutes and required nine defibrillator shocks. A combined team of FDNY firefighters and FDNY emergency medical services crews responded to the 911 call, which was made by Arnold\u2019s 12-year-old daughter. During the near-death experience, the cardiac arrest survivor \u2014 who was assigned male at birth and now prefers they/them pronouns \u2014 had a profound and life-changing memory. Arnold remembers traveling feet-first over an expanse of water, floating on what seemed to be a stone-like surface. Overhead was an endless sky, and Arnold felt completely safe, free of fear, and neither male nor female. Arnold, now 53, has had gender dysphoria since about the age of 3 or 4, although they didn\u2019t always know there was a name for the feeling that one\u2019s gender identity doesn\u2019t match the one registered at birth. \u201cFor me, that was like a lifelong puzzle,\" Arnold said. \"And then, when I go into cardiac arrest and I\u2019m in that water, there was no gender, so there was no assignment there. It allowed me to embrace that of myself.\u201d  After waking from a three-day coma and a long hospitalization, doctors gave Arnold an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD, a battery-operated implanted device that can shock the heart if necessary. Two years later they had surgery to repair a damaged heart valve. After the experience, Arnold began emerging out and presenting as mixgender/transgender and, soon after, married their girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who walked me through this, as she constantly says to me, be yourself, be yourself, just be yourself,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest thing for anybody to do.\u201d The couple has a new baby, now 8 months. The cardiac arrest \u201chelped me understand that gender is nothing,\u201d Arnold said.  Zach Lonergan, a 32-year-old scientist who lives in Pasadena, California, was regularly logging 15- to 18-mile runs with his friends as they prepared for the Los Angeles Marathon. As part of the training, they all decided to run the Rose Bowl Half Marathon. \u201cWe\u2019re like, oh, 13 miles for a half marathon is no big deal,\u201d Lonergan said. However, when race day came in January, Lonergan wasn\u2019t feeling well. \u201cOf course, I ignored my symptoms and decided to run a really fast race,\u201d he said. Despite feeling tired for the last few miles, he crossed the finish line. When he went to pick up his medal, he collapsed. Without a pulse or heart beat, emergency workers performed CPR and shocked Lonergan's heart twice.  Lonergan doesn\u2019t remember the collapse. He does recall being awake and aware in a dark place that was unfamiliar, describing it like opening your eyes in a cave.  \u201cIt felt strange, but at the same time, it was the most peaceful time of my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this darkness, I felt extremely warm, and extremely peaceful.\u201d  After he was resuscitated, doctors gave him an ICD implant that would shock the heart, if necessary. After he recovered, Lonergan did feel some anxiety, especially when it came to running. However, he also recalls it being a time of \u201cprolonged peacefulness.\u201d Grateful to be alive, he no longer feared death. He took a \u201creunion tour\u201d to reconnect with friends he hadn\u2019t seen in years.  \u201cYou only get one life and you have to cherish the people you have around you,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest gift that I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d Dr. Melinda Greer, 65, was being evaluated for chest pain at a cardiac intensive care unit when her heart stopped. Greer, a retired pediatrician in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, had asystole, a failure of the heart\u2019s electrical system which causes the heart to stop pumping, or flat-line. That was 10 years ago. She is finally opening up about what she feels was a positive experience. As the nurse was performing CPR on her, Greer saw an \u201cincredible white light\u201d and felt \u201can incredible all-encompassing, all-surrounding sense of love.\u201d  She felt like she had returned to a \u201cplace that felt like home to me, and I was back amongst a group of what I can only call beings, because we weren\u2019t physical, that I considered my group.\u201d  It was \u201ca wonderful experience,\" she said. \"I really was angry when they brought me back.\u201d After Greer left the hospital, she decided to retire early, focusing on creative pursuits and new experiences, rather than acquiring things. She encourages people to get more involved in the \u201cpositive aspects of living in a beautiful world.\u201d \u201cFeel the wind, get out in nature, take off your shoes and socks and put your feet firmly on the ground and just listen to that inner voice, that\u2019s what I would recommend,\" she said. \"I wish I\u2019d done it long ago.\u201d Connie Fuller, 55, lives in Warrior, Alabama, just north of Birmingham. In 2020, Fuller was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In 2021, she and her husband made the hard decision to sell their swimming pool business to spend more time together. But the day of the sale was particularly stressful, and she started having chest pain. She was admitted to the hospital for observation, although tests had ruled out a heart attack. It was at this point that she developed bradycardia, an abnormally slow heart rate, and her heart stopped. Fuller doesn\u2019t remember when the nurse started CPR. She didn\u2019t feel any pain, although she found out later that the nurse broke her sternum and several ribs, a common occurrence during CPR. \u201cI love her, she saved my life,\" Fuller said. What Fuller does remember is hearing her husband\u2019s voice when he came back into the room. \u201cWe started dating when I was 14, he was 16,\" she said. \"He sounded like that little 16-year-old boy. That was the voice that I heard.\" She feels that her husband\u2019s voice helped pull her back into her body, as the medical team worked to revive her. \u201cI do remember thinking, this feels so good and so peaceful and it\u2019s so calm and there\u2019s no worries here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, I remembered my husband and my daughter and I knew I could not leave them.\u201d Based on her experience, Fuller advises family members to talk to patients, even when it seems they are dying. \u201cIf it\u2019s safe, and possible \u2014 allow the family members to be there to talk to the patient,\u201d she said. Fuller, who believes in God, wondered why she didn\u2019t have experiences that are more like the traditional concept of heaven. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s been a lot to handle,\u201d she said. \"I thought, why wasn\u2019t I in heaven? Why didn\u2019t I see my relatives? Why didn\u2019t I see the white light? You know, why didn\u2019t that happen for me?\u201d Fuller turned out to have takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome, which is a weakness of the heart muscle that can be caused by severe stress. \u201cI thought at that time I had wasted my heartbeats worrying about a swimming pool store,\" Fuller said. \"That\u2019s when I prayed and I begged God, please give me one more chance to not waste any more heartbeats on something that\u2019s not important. I won\u2019t. I will not do that again.\u201d Theresa Tamkins is a health reporter and editor who has worked for BuzzFeed News, Health.com and Reuters Health.

        "content": "The coronavirus isn\u2019t the only pathogen that can cause symptoms that last months, or even years, after an initial infection is overcome, a new study published Friday in The Lancet\u2019s eClinicalMedicine suggests.  In an analysis of data from 10,171 U.K. adults, the researchers found evidence of a \u201clong cold\u201d syndrome that can follow infection with a variety of common respiratory viruses, including common cold viruses and influenza. While some of the symptoms of long Covid and long colds overlapped, the study noted that people with long Covid were more likely to continue to experience lightheadedness, dizziness and problems with taste and smell; lingering long cold symptoms were more likely to include coughing, stomach pain and diarrhea.  Experts said the new research could help shine a light on the types of long-lasting symptoms that come after recovery from an illness, including chronic fatigue syndrome. \u201cThese syndromes are not a new phenomenon, but existing research has largely focused on people who survived a severe infection, often having been hospitalized,\u201d said the lead author, Giulia Vivaldi, a statistician and epidemiologist at Queen Mary University in London. \u201cThe emergence of long Covid has shown us that people can be burdened with long-lasting symptoms regardless of the severity of their own infection, and our findings suggest that this may not be unique to SARS-CoV-2.\u201d A study published this year found that the percentage of patients who developed a \u201clong flu\u201d syndrome after having caught influenza was similar to that of patients who developed long Covid after SARS-CoV-2 infections. It\u2019s not yet clear why some people develop long-lasting symptoms after infections, Vivaldi said in an email. The study suggests that more severe illness \u2014 whether from Covid or other respiratory infections \u2014 can increase a person\u2019s risk of long illness. But, she added, \u201cwe know that this isn\u2019t the only driver of risk in long Covid, and so may not be the only driver of \u2018long colds\u2019 either.\u201d  To take a closer look at whether respiratory viruses other than Covid might cause syndromes similar to long Covid, Vivaldi and her colleagues turned to a dataset called COVIDENCE UK, an ongoing population-based observational study of Covid-19. The researchers focused on participants not vaccinated against Covid who filled out a questionnaire in early 2021 about respiratory illnesses and long-lasting symptoms. Around 13% of the people in the study had been diagnosed with Covid at least four weeks before, and another 4.6% had been diagnosed with non-Covid acute respiratory infections, such as influenza, common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and ear infection. People were more likely to develop post-infection syndromes if they had more severe symptoms during their initial infections, but long-lasting symptoms could develop even in those with milder courses of illness, the researchers found. The new findings are a \u201cstep forward, showing that Covid is not alone in causing long-lasting symptoms,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The study is \u201crigorous and large,\u201d Schaffner said, adding that the findings might help researchers better understand how people develop post-infection syndromes, including chronic fatigue syndrome. \u201cNo viral culprit has been identified yet as a cause for chronic fatigue syndrome, but I have high hopes we will learn something useful,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are looking for inflammatory markers that might indicate an immune response overreaction. Find those and then you can work back to see how a virus triggers that response.\u201d Long Covid research may offer a unique opportunity to help scientists better understand what leads to long-lasting symptoms in those who\u2019ve developed post-infection syndromes related to other viruses and bacteria, said David Putrino, a professor of rehabilitation and human performance at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.  That\u2019s both because so many people have developed long Covid and because it gives researchers a clear example of a virus\u2019 leading to long-lasting symptoms, Putrino said. Neither Schaffner nor Putrino were involved with the new research. Putrino has been involved with long Covid research since reports of lingering symptoms in Covid patients first emerged early in the pandemic. Last month, he co-authored a study, published in the journal Nature, identifying immune system differences in the blood of people who have long Covid and those who don\u2019t.  A number of factors probably determine whether a post-infection syndrome develops, including genetics, the type of pathogen and whether a person was in good physical health before having encountered the pathogen, Putrino said. Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said the exact details of what goes wrong and triggers a post-infection syndrome haven\u2019t been worked out yet.  Most doctors, however, have seen patients with those kinds of long-lasting symptoms after acute infections, Covid or otherwise, said Ray, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.  \u201cIt\u2019s not an uncommon pattern,\u201d he said. Studies like this one, Ray said, make a good case for doing what you can to avoid being infected in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be aware that there can be long-term consequences from these infections,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Popular weight loss drugs linked to rare but severe stomach problems, study finds",
        "content": "People who take popular drugs for weight loss, such as Ozempic or Wegovy, may be at an increased risk of severe stomach problems, research published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds. The brief report is the first study of its kind, the researchers say, to establish a link between the use of such drugs, called GLP-1 agonists, for weight loss and the risk of such gastrointestinal conditions. GLP-1 agonists include semaglutide \u2014 the drug found in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 and liraglutide, the drug used in Saxenda. Both drugs are made by Novo Nordisk. \u201cAlthough rare, the incidence of these adverse events can happen. I\u2019ve seen it happen,\u201d said lead author Mohit Sodhi, a medical student at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine in Vancouver. \u201cPeople should know what they\u2019re getting into.\u201d  The drugs were originally developed to help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels but were later found to be effective for weight loss. GLP-1 medications work, in part, by slowing down how quickly food passes through the stomach, leading people to feel fuller longer. But they can also lead to gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, as shown in clinical trials and noted on drug labels. More recently, as the drugs have skyrocketed in popularity, there have been reports of patients who developed stomach paralysis, or gastroparesis. In August, Novo Nordisk was sued over claims that Ozempic caused a woman's stomach paralysis. (Eli Lilly, which makes another GLP-1 drug, tirzepatide, was also included in the lawsuit.)  The new research, based on health insurance claims from 2006 to 2020 from more than 5,000 patients in the U.S., looked at how many people developed one of four serious gastrointestinal problems \u2014 biliary disease, gastroparesis, pancreatitis or bowel obstructions \u2014 after they were prescribed one of the weight loss drugs. About 4,100 of the patients were prescribed liraglutide, about 600 semaglutide and 650 the weight loss drug bupropion-naltrexone, which is not a GLP-1 medication. Wegovy was not approved until 2021. However, Ozempic, which has the same active ingredient semaglutide, was approved in 2017 and some doctors prescribe it off-label for weight loss. People included in the analysis all had records of obesity and did not have diabetes, which itself can cause gastroparesis.  Compared to people taking bupropion-naltrexone, people taking a GLP-1 drug had a higher risk of pancreatitis, bowel obstruction and gastroparesis, the study found. There was no increase in risk for biliary disease, which includes conditions that affect the gallbladder, the liver and the bile ducts, as its incidence was similar for both types of drugs. Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreatitis, occurred at a rate of about 5 cases per 1,000 users of semaglutide and 8 cases per 1,000 users of liraglutide. The condition causes severe abdominal pain and, in some cases, requires hospitalization and surgery.  Gastroparesis was seen at a rate of about 10 cases per 1,000 semaglutide users and 7 cases per 1,000 liraglutide users. The condition, which can be difficult to treat, causes severe nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. It can have \u201ca significant impact on the quality of life,\u201d Sodhi said. Bowel obstructions \u2014 which occur when a blockage prevents food or liquid from moving through the intestines  \u2014 were seen at a rate of 8 cases per 1,000 users of liraglutide. There were no observed cases in semaglutide users. Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed to treat a bowel obstruction. Sodhi said that although the conditions are rare, the medications\u2019 widespread popularity means that if 1 million people are prescribed those drugs, tens or even hundreds of thousands of people could experience them. Allison Schneider, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that \"patient safety is a top priority.\" The product labels for Wegovy and Saxenda include information about potential side effects, including pancreatitis, acute gallbladder disease, ileus and delayed gastric emptying, she added. (Ileus refers to a type of bowel obstruction.) \u201cWe work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to continuously monitor the safety profile of our medicines,\u201d Schneider said. Dr. Andres Acosta, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic, said the findings tell us that GLP-1 medications are generally safe but may carry a risk of serious gastrointestinal side effects.  \u201cI\u2019ve been telling my patients all along that we need to understand that all medications, including GLP-1s, have potential risks,\u201d said Acosta, who was not involved with the research. \u201cAnd we know that the GLP-1 medications have a risk of nausea, vomiting and delay of gastric emptying.\u201d Still, Acosta was not overly swayed by the study\u2019s findings, saying some of the side effects listed in it could be the result of patients\u2019 rapid weight loss, not the medications. He said he would like to see a large randomized controlled clinical trial looking at people who received the medications or placebos.  (The clinical trials that drug companies conducted prior to the drugs\u2019 approval were not large enough to detect rarer side effects, Sodhi said.) Dr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, said she is unlikely to change her prescribing practices for GLP-1 medications after having reviewed the study\u2019s findings. \u201cWe still need to be careful,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis just further emphasizes, like many of things in the past, that these medications need to be regulated by a physician or a medical provider who is going to take a good history, monitor the patient closely and stop the medication if they have these side effects.\u201d  She said the rare side effects do not scare her as much as the health conditions that come from obesity or being overweight. \u201cI can go into the hospital, have pancreatitis treated and stop taking the medication,\u201d Levy said. \u201cBut if I die of a heart attack, no it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and the senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, advised that patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs should be counseled about starting the lowest dose and gradually increasing it, waiting at least four to six weeks before they escalate to the next dose. Doctors should also discuss the risk of pancreatitis, which includes a history of gallstones or past cases of pancreatitis, and avoid its risk factors, which include drinking alcohol while using the medication.

        "title": "End of an era: The CDC has stopped printing Covid vaccination cards",
        "content": "It\u2019s the end of an era for a once-critical pandemic document: The ubiquitous white Covid vaccination cards are being phased out. Now that Covid vaccines are not being distributed by the federal government, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped printing new cards. The federal government shipped more than 980 million cards between late 2020, when the first vaccines came out, through May 10, according to the latest available data from the CDC. Federal and local health officials don\u2019t expect the discontinuation of the cards to be a particularly big change, since the days of keeping them tucked in purses and wallets to ensure entry into festivals, bars and restaurants are largely over. If you\u2019ve held on to your card, it\u2019s still valid as proof of vaccination. Otherwise, people who need their Covid immunization records will need to request them just like any other vaccine. In many cases, the clinic, pharmacy or health department that provided the shot can provide those records. Every state and some cities have an immunization registry, though rules vary on when records are included and options for obtaining copies of your records. Records from the mass vaccination sites held early in the pandemic also should be available in those registries, depending on state laws. There is no national registry for immunization records. For example, Texas requires patients\u2019 written consent to be included in the registry, San Antonio Metropolitan Health District spokesman David Andres Alegria said. Other places, including Wyoming and Philadelphia\u2019s city-specific record system, require vaccine providers to log all vaccinations. Many states offer digital vaccination records for individuals either online or through an app. Users can save a certificate or a QR code that proves they are vaccinated. And some websites will even track and alert patients when they\u2019re due for another one. \u201cOne of the positives (during the pandemic) was having increased autonomy on your patient record, especially the immunization record,\u201d said Jeff Chorath, who manages the immunization information system in Washington state. Washington offers two digital options for obtaining vaccination records \u2014 a comprehensive list of all of a person\u2019s vaccinations noted in the state database and one specific to Covid vaccines. Other states don\u2019t have the same options, so it might take longer to get your records. There could also be gaps in state databases; for example, if you were vaccinated by a federal health provider, those records may be tracked in a separate system. As for your old card \u2014 if you still have it \u2014 maybe don\u2019t mail it off to the Smithsonian quite yet. You should save it like any other health record, Wyoming Department of Health nurse consultant Heidi Gurov said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to keep those in a safe spot,\u201d she said. Four million people in the U.S. have received the latest Covid vaccine since it was approved last month, CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen said Wednesday, and a total of 10 million doses have been shipped to providers.

        "title": "Sticking to a vegetarian diet may be partly genetic, study finds",
        "content": "Have you ever tried to be vegetarian but found it too difficult to stop eating meat? Your genes could be partly to blame, a new study suggests.  The research, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, identified a set of genes associated with people who adhered to a vegetarian diet for at least a year.  Nabeel Yaseen, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor emeritus of pathology at Northwestern University, said the findings may indicate that sticking with vegetarianism isn\u2019t solely a matter of willpower.  \u201cThe take-home message is that, based on your genetics, a vegetarian diet may or may not be appropriate for you,\u201d Yaseen said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to blame yourself if this is something you can\u2019t really stick with.\u201d  The study compared the genetics of thousands of vegetarians and meat-eaters who shared their medical and lifestyle data with the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical research database containing information from about half a million participants in the U.K. The study analyzed data from approximately 5,300 vegetarians and 329,000 meat-eaters, and identified three genes that are significantly linked to the choice of a vegetarian lifestyle. All three are located on a chromosome that has genes involved in brain function and lipid metabolism \u2014 the process in which fats are broken down for energy. The results also pointed to 31 other genes associated with vegetarianism as well, though more weakly. Several of those genes play a role in lipid metabolism too.  \u201cWe are hypothesizing that maybe one\u2019s ability to adhere to a vegetarian diet may have something to do with how they deal with fats in their body and how that affects brain function,\u201d Yaseen said. However, he added that the study simply highlights a genetic connection and does not assert that particular genes directly cause people to prefer a vegetarian diet. For the research, Yaseen and his team focused on people they considered strict vegetarians \u2014 those who had not consumed animal flesh or meat products for at least a year. They determined who qualified based on two questionnaires that participants filled out for the U.K. Biobank. The first, administered four times between 2006 and 2019, asked participants to self-report whether they had eaten meat within the last year. The second, administered five times between 2009 and 2012, asked people to log everything they had eaten within the prior 24 hours.  The idea that our genes influence dietary preferences isn\u2019t new or surprising. A study published last year also found links between people\u2019s genes and the types of food they like, and aversions to certain foods have long been understood to have genetic ties. For example, it\u2019s fairly well-known that some people have a version of a gene that can lead them to dislike cilantro. \u201cThe cilantro gene is actually an olfactory receptor in your nose that binds aroma compounds in cilantro,\u201d said Joanne Cole, an assistant professor in the department of biomedical informatics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. \u201cSome people have a version of this gene that makes them smell and taste cilantro as soapy, and so they tend to not eat it as much.\u201d Yaseen said his findings, however, are novel in the way they establish a link between particular genes and vegetarianism. A lot of past research, by contrast, has relied on comparisons of twins to investigate the role genetics play in dietary preferences. Dr. Laura Wesseldijk, the lead author of one such twin study, said research she published in January found that genetics can \u201caccount for 70 to 80% of individual differences in abstinence from eating beef, pork, poultry, fish and shellfish.\u201d Wesseldijk, a behavioral geneticist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research, noted, however, that human traits are never determined by nature or nurture alone. Rather, \u201cit\u2019s all completely entangled,\u201d she said. When it comes to diet, Wesseldijk added, a person\u2019s upbringing and surroundings \u2014 which in turn can be influenced by their religious and moral beliefs, health concerns or culture \u2014 play a large role. \u201cAn environment can completely counteract something that is highly heritable, and the same goes with vegetarianism,\u201d she said. Yaseen, for his part, pointed out a couple key limitations of his study: For one, the research only included white caucasians. Other ethnicities were excluded, he said, to ensure that genes that may be associated with a particular race weren\u2019t incorrectly linked with being vegetarian. So the research would need to be repeated in other groups to determine whether the findings apply more broadly. Second, the study only examined a small fraction of the human genome, leaving open the possibility that additional genes may also be associated with being vegetarian.  Yaseen said he doesn\u2019t have immediate plans for further research on the topic but could imagine a time in the future \u2014 after much more research has been completed \u2014 when it might be possible for experts to assess whether a vegetarian diet is a good fit for an individual based on their DNA. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll know more, and we\u2019ll be able to maybe test people genetically and say, \u2018OK, you know, this diet is good for you, or this diet is not good for you\u2019 \u2014 like have more personalized dietary recommendations.\u201d Katie Mogg is an intern at NBC News.

        "title": "Surgery and other medical procedures are delayed by the Kaiser strike, patients say",
        "content": "Operations were rescheduled, chemotherapy treatments were canceled and other procedures deemed \u201cnon-urgent\u201d were postponed as tens of thousands of health care workers nationwide began to strike Wednesday. In what union leaders call the largest health care worker strike in U.S. history, more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente employees across five states walked off the job this week, demanding better working conditions amid failed contract negotiations.  The strike, expected to last three days in some areas, affects more than 40 Kaiser Permanente hospitals and medical office buildings in California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Virginia and Washington, D.C., according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. The majority of striking workers are in California, where Kaiser Permanente, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit health care organization, is based.  Disruptions left patients in the state reeling.  In Sacramento, toddler Caden Young had been scheduled to undergo ear tube surgery Thursday after having suffered from recurring ear infections, but the operation was postponed Tuesday until December \u201cbecause of limited staff,\u201d said his mother, Tiffany Young. \u201cThat was really upsetting,\u201d she said, adding that the procedure would relieve her 17-month-old son\u2019s pain, help drain out liquid in his ears and reduce how often he would have to take antibiotics.   \u201cWe were talking about it all last week, this week, how we\u2019re looking forward to it, how we hope that it\u2019s going to make him feel so much better, and then just getting that call yesterday was so heartbreaking,\u201d said Young, 36. \u201cI know that it\u2019s considered minor, but to a parent, when your baby is suffering, it\u2019s super important,\" she added. In Modesto, John Schnaidt, 69, had an appointment scheduled Wednesday for his weekly dose of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, which is terminal. But Tuesday, he got a call from Kaiser telling him his session had been canceled, said his wife, Lisa Schnaidt. Appalled, the couple sought help from KOVR-TV of Sacramento, which helped reverse the cancellation \u2014 an outcome Lisa Schnaidt said many others did not get. \u201cWhat makes me sad is all these chairs that are empty right now,\" she said. \"I just know every time we\u2019ve been in here, it\u2019s busy. Almost every chair has been full, and I\u2019m looking at a lot of empty chairs right now.\u201d \"It's eerily quiet,\" she added. Lisa Schnaidt said the oncologist at the facility said tough decisions had to be made because of understaffing. \"The people that have a chance at a cure were left on the schedule, and the people who have a chance at possible surgery down the road were left on the schedule,\" she said the oncologist told her. \"Neither applies to my husband,\" she said. \"That tells me \u2018you\u2019re not worth it today.\u2019 I can understand it, but I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d In San Francisco, Alanna Darby, 33, had been waiting seven months for the next step in her gender-affirming care, facial feminization surgery. She learned Monday that her appointment, which was scheduled for Thursday, had been canceled.  \u201cI got a call from the scheduler that they had to cancel,\u201d Darby said, \u201cand they just didn\u2019t have any bookings open yet.\u201d She said not knowing when she will be able to have the surgery is difficult: \u201cWhat hurts is that, you know, I had something to look forward to and something that would make me feel more in my body.\u201d To prepare for the procedure, Darby had to stop hormone replacement therapy and could not shave her face. \u201cI\u2019ve been having mood swings and gender dysphoria, because, like, oh, the thing that makes me feel better in my body I can\u2019t do right now,\u201d she said. In a statement, Kaiser said it might have to \"reschedule certain non-urgent appointments and procedures, as long as that is appropriate and safe for the patient.\" A spokesperson denied that Kaiser canceled chemotherapy treatments for terminal cancer patients in Modesto but kept them for non-terminal cancer patients because of the strike. \"We recognize how important any appointment is to a patient, and we are committed to minimizing any disruption a strike can cause,\" the statement said. Kaiser would not say how many appointments were canceled or rescheduled. It serves nearly 13 million people nationwide, according to its website.  Many medical offices, departments and services in California were listed as closed on Kaiser's website during the days of the strike. Workers on strike include licensed vocational nurses; optometrists; behavioral health workers; pharmacists; emergency, radiology and surgical technicians; and people in hundreds of other roles, the union said. In an earlier statement, Kaiser said that management and union representatives are still at the bargaining table and that it remains committed to reaching a new agreement. It said that in anticipation of a strike, it put into place \"robust contingency plans\" to make sure patients were still served. It said that all hospitals and emergency departments will remain open and that many trained contract workers would help backfill striking employees. \"Our plans ensure that the urgent needs of our members and patients are the top priority,\" it said.

        "title": "Nasal esketamine works better than alternative for treatment-resistant depression, study finds",
        "content": "A nasal spray version of esketamine was more effective for depression that is resistant to treatment than a more commonly used drug, research published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine found.  Esketamine is a more potent form of ketamine, an anesthetic that doctors have used for many years to treat depression. The nasal spray, from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is sold under the name Spravato and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment-resistant depression in 2019. Janssen funded the new study, which took place in 24 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.  \u201cTreatment-resistant depression is a pretty significant problem,\u201d said Dr. Michael Grunebaum, an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City and a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. The condition \u2014 commonly defined as depression that does not respond to two or more consecutive drug treatments \u2014 is estimated to affect 30% to 50% of people with major depressive disorder, said Grunebaum, who was not involved with the new study but researches ketamine. In the study, 336 adults with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to receive nasal esketamine in addition to the antidepressant medication they were already taking, either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Another 340 patients added quetiapine to their drug regimen. Quetiapine is the generic name for Seroquel, an antipsychotic drug that has been on the market since 2007 and is sometimes used to boost the effects of antidepressants in people with treatment-resistant depression. At the eight-week mark, 27.1% of patients taking esketamine were in remission \u2014 meaning they were largely symptom-free \u2014 compared to 17.6% of the quetiapine group. By 32 weeks, 21.7% of patients in the esketamine group remained in remission after reaching it at eight weeks compared to 14.1% of those taking quetiapine. Grunebaum said the results were \u201cquite significant.\u201d  Dr. Allan Young, one of the paper\u2019s authors and an academic psychiatrist at King\u2019s College London, said that while 27.1% may seem small, it\u2019s better than the benchmark: One of the largest and longest U.S. studies of depression, conducted at the beginning of this century, showed 13% of patients with treatment-resistant depression reached remission in response to drugs available at the time, Young said.  And remission in that earlier study didn\u2019t last long, Young added. \u201cThey got better, but it was evanescent. They went back to being depressed,\u201d he said. Still, the rates of remission seen in the esketamine study were low, said Dr. Amit Anand, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a director of translational clinical trials at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe bottom line is that better treatments need to be developed,\u201d said Anand, who researches ketamine but was not involved with the new paper. That not all patients who achieved remission at week eight remained in remission by week 32 is not surprising, Grunebaum said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t struck that it seemed radically different from standard antidepressant medications,\u201d he said. The study also showed that beyond eight weeks, a growing number of patients in both groups continued to reach remission. At week 32, 49.1% of patients in the esketamine group and 32.9% of the patients in the quetiapine group were in remission. The study had limitations. It compared nasal esketamine to only one other drug. Other drugs used to augment treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression include low-dose lithium, thyroid medication, atypical antidepressants like bupropion, and pramipexole, a drug used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. In addition, Grunebaum noted that the patients were 90% white, so the results may not apply to people of other races.  Anand said that the method of drug administration may have confounded the results. People receiving nasal esketamine had to come to the hospital two times a week to take the nasal spray in front of health care workers, while those taking quetiapine took a pill at home.  \u201cThere is no comparison in the amount of attention given to the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d That additional attention itself to patients in the esketamine group may have lessened their feelings of depression.  Esketamine\u2019s long-term safety is unknown. Studies of people addicted to ketamine have shown potential injury to brain tissues as well as the lining of the bladder, said Grunebaum, who doesn\u2019t prescribe it in any form to his patients.  \u201cWe can usually find a combination of standard medications that work adequately,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for more information about long-term safety.\u201d Spravato may be covered by insurance, including Medicare, but doctors have to spend a lot of time documenting treatment-resistant depression, Grunebaum said. Insurance more readily covers other drugs used to augment treatment, many of which are available as generics. In addition, ketamine is considered a controlled substance in the U.S. because of its potential for abuse and addiction. Patients must take it at a health care provider\u2019s office or clinic. Many may prefer a medication they can take at home. But Young, the study author, said the visits for the nasal spray are reduced over time, from twice a week in the beginning to a maintenance dose of every two weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve got one patient who takes it once every eight weeks and probably will be able to stop quite soon,\u201d he said.

        "title": "'Good' cholesterol levels may increase dementia risk",
        "content": "So-called \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol may not be as healthy as experts once thought, a new study suggests.  The new study, published Wednesday in Neurology, found that having either high or low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, cholesterol, may increase the risk of dementia in older adults. It\u2019s more evidence showing that keeping HDL cholesterol within a certain range is important for cardiovascular and brain health.   \u201cThe relationship between HDL cholesterol and dementia is more complex than we previously thought,\" said the study\u2019s lead author, Erin Ferguson, a doctoral student studying epidemiology at the University of California San Francisco. \"While the magnitude of this relationship is relatively small, it\u2019s important,\u201d The results show a correlation between HDL cholesterol and dementia, but do not prove that low or high levels of the lipid directly caused dementia.  The study, which was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the National Institutes of Health, included more than 184,000 adults with an average age of 70. None had dementia when the study began. Researchers used a combination of surveys and electronic records from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan to track cholesterol levels, health behaviors and whether someone developed dementia over about 13 years. During that time, just more than 25,000 people developed dementia.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people keep their total cholesterol at about 150 mg/dL, or milligrams per deciliter of blood, with LDL at or below 100 mg/dL. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, has long been recognized for its often deadly impact on the cardiovascular system. The study\u2019s participants were divided into three groups based on their HDL cholesterol levels, with adjustments for other dementia risk factors, including high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and how often a person drinks.   The average HDL cholesterol level in the study was 53.7 mg/dL, within the recommended range of 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women.  People whose cholesterol levels strayed too far from these numbers were more likely to develop dementia over the course of the study.  People whose levels were at least 65 mg/dL \u2014 the highest of the three groups \u2014 were 15% more likely to develop dementia. Those with the lowest levels \u2014 11 to 41 mg/dL \u2014 had a 7% increased risk compared to the middle group. The researchers didn\u2019t find any association between LDL cholesterol and dementia risk.  Dr. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart in New York, said he was surprised by the findings.  \u201cWhen people have HDL that\u2019s 90 or 100 mg/dL, that can be associated with increased cardiovascular risk, not necessarily dementia. These lower numbers, 53-63 mg/dL, have also not been associated with greater risk,\u201d said Weintraub, who was not involved with the research. Experts have long understood that not all HDL cholesterol is equal. How the body uses it and where it\u2019s stored \u2013\u2013 in the brain or elsewhere in the body \u2013\u2013 make a difference.  Healthy habits, including exercise, allow HDL cholesterol to become HDL particles. This allows HDL to perform some of the important tasks it\u2019s touted for, including removing LDL cholesterol from the arteries and transporting it to the liver, where the body gets rid of it, said Dr. Hussein Yassine, an endocrinologist at the Keck Medicine of USC who specializes in how changes in lipid metabolism impact a person\u2019s risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cThe function is really in the particles, not the cholesterol itself,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply increasing HDL levels does not increase its function.\u201d High HDL cholesterol levels can stiffen veins and arteries. This impact on the cardiovascular system is a key way high levels of HDL cholesterol may increase risk of cognitive impairment \u2013\u2013 stroke is one of the leading risk factors for dementia. HDL cholesterol in the brain acts in a completely different way.  \u201cIt operates on different rules and has different pathways than systemic cholesterol,\u201d Yassine said. Systemic cholesterol is cholesterol stored elsewhere in the body, outside the brain.  Too much HDL cholesterol in the brain can cause inflammation that prompts the brain to produce amyloids, abnormal deposits that damage organs and tissues, he added.  Another recent study established a connection between genes linked to high HDL cholesterol levels and those that predispose someone to dementia. Together, the studies point to the fact that HDL cholesterol is both complex and an area of research that needs to be better understood.  Weintraub said there isn\u2019t yet enough evidence to say that HDL cholesterol plays a significant role in dementia risk \u201cThis paper might suggest that HDL could be a modifiable risk factor even in late life,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say that people have to be worried about this just yet.\u201d Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.

        "title": "Many LGBTQ people report having experienced conversion therapy, study finds",
        "content": "A substantial proportion of LGBTQ people report having been subjected to systematic efforts to deter them from expressing their sexuality or gender identity, according to a major new international review of over a dozen studies. Known as conversion therapy, such treatment has been broadly condemned by psychological and medical organizations and has been banned for minors in 22 states. Transgender people, the study found, reported a history of conversion therapy at a higher rate than gays and lesbians. \u201cWe\u2019re disheartened to find that these practices remain prevalent,\u201d said Travis Salway, an assistant professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Salway is the lead author of the study, which is the first international systematic review \u2014 considered one of the strongest forms of scientific evidence \u2014 to examine how commonly sexual and gender minorities report having experienced conversion therapy.  He and his co-authors published their findings Wednesday in PLOS One. They analyzed 14 survey studies of LGBTQ people, conducted between 2011 and 2020. Six were from the U.S., four from Canada, and one each from Australia, Colombia, South Korea and the United Kingdom.  None of these studies were based on representative samples of LGBTQ people. So the review\u2019s findings aren\u2019t necessarily generalizable to gay and trans populations at large. The proportion of study populations reporting having experienced conversion therapy ranged widely, from 2% to 34%, with a median of 8.5%.  \u201cThis is a big problem. It really should be a big problem even if it\u2019s happening to one person,\u201d said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and one of the leading advocates in the decadeslong movement to end conversion therapy, referring to the apparent persistence of the practice. He was not involved in the study.  The paper cited a definition of conversion therapy written by one of its co-authors, Florence Ashley, an assistant professor in the faculty of law at the University of Alberta, who called it \u201cany treatment, practice, or sustained effort that aims to change, discourage, or repress a person\u2019s sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression. . . or any behaviour associated with a gender other than the person\u2019s sex assigned at birth.\u201d  The median proportion reporting a conversion therapy history was higher in the U.S., at 13%, than in Canada, at 7%. Salway\u2019s team wrote that Canadian attitudes toward sexual and gender minorities may be \u201cmore affirming\u201d than those in the U.S.  A median of 8% of racial minorities and Indigenous North Americans reported a history of conversion therapy, compared with 5% of whites. The study authors noted the legacy of U.S. and Canadian governments forcibly sending Indigenous children to boarding schools, where European gender and sexuality norms were enforced. The analysis found that a median of 12% of trans people reported a history of conversion therapy, compared with 4% of gay people. The authors theorized that this disparity was likely due in part to the longer history of health professionals condemning conversion therapy for homosexuality. They also pointed to \u201cslower improvements in affirming attitudes, social policies and legal protection regarding transgender people.\u201d  Whether gay or trans, people assigned male at birth were more likely than those assigned female at birth to report experiencing conversion therapy. The researchers theorized this could be in part because of greater stigma toward effeminacy in boys than masculinity in girls.  Two additional studies included in the review examined surveys of mental health professionals. A British survey conducted two decades ago found that about 1 in 5 psychologists and 1 in 10 psychiatrists reported having treated at least one patient to reduce their same-sex attraction. And a U.S. study of marriage and family therapists, published in 2013, found that 3.5% reported having practiced conversion therapy.  The review paper\u2019s authors stated that they hope it will affect policy, by conveying to lawmakers how commonly LGBTQ people have experienced conversion therapy. However, the investigators were not able to break down their findings according to respondents\u2019 age, and the study provides no insights into how the incidence of these practices has changed over time.  That said, Ilan Meyer, a researcher at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute and the lead author of one of the reviewed studies, said that his team analyzed 2016 to 2017 survey responses from gay Americans born between 1956 and 1997 and found no significant differences between birth cohorts within that period in the proportion reporting conversion therapy exposure. This suggested persistence in conversion therapy practices, Meyer said.   \u201cI really wanted it to be true,\u201d said Nathan, 29, a Midwestern gay man, of the hope that the conversion therapy he underwent at 16 would end his same-sex attraction. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine myself as a gay adult.\u201d  Nathan, who asked to go only by his first name to save his parents from scrutiny for sanctioning his adolescent request to see a conversion therapist, said of the counselor, \u201cObviously, he has to have figured out at some point that this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Once common practice among psychotherapists, counseling to change a patient from gay to straight came to be seen as unethical by mainstream mental health professionals in recent decades. Research into conversion therapy\u2019s harms to gay individuals began to emerge in the mid-1990s. Investigations into the practice\u2019s impact on trans people have been undertaken much more recently. The American Psychological Association first issued a resolution opposing conversion therapy for homosexuality in 1997, concluding in 2009 that such practices are \u201cunlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm.\u201d The APA expanded such opposition to include gender identity in 2021. The PLOS One paper stated that the practice is associated with \u201csevere psychological distress, depression, substance abuse, and attempted suicide.\u201d An analysis of a 2015 survey of trans adults, published in 2019, found that those who reported a history of conversion therapy were more likely to have experienced recent severe psychological distress and a history of suicide attempts. Conversion therapy \u201chas hurt a lot of people,\u201d said Erica Anderson, a clinical psychologist and a past president of the trans health care group USPATH. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any studies saying that it helped people long-term.\u201d  All this said, because the authors of the review paper analyzed survey studies that by definition examined the recollections of sexual and gender minorities, they wrote that a limitation of their analysis was that it could not capture the experiences of any people who experienced conversion therapy and ultimately did identify as cisgender (meaning not trans) and heterosexual.  The investigators excluded studies intended to survey people actively seeking conversion therapy, theorizing that if they had, the median prevalence rates seen in their analysis likely would have been even higher. Two papers excluded from the analysis for this reason had prevalence estimates of 15% and 20%. According to the Williams Institute, which estimated in a 2019 report that 698,000 American LGBTQ adults had experienced conversion therapy, the form practiced today is most commonly talk therapy. Historically, practitioners have used aversion therapy, including inducing nausea and vomiting or providing electric shocks. The practice has often been grounded in religious beliefs. California became the first state to ban conversion therapy for minors in 2012. Since then, 21 additional states plus Washington, D.C., have enacted similar bans, which apply to both gender identity and sexual orientation. These laws generally exempt religious or spiritual advisers. The new review paper\u2019s authors noted that the studies they analyzed did not define conversion therapy uniformly and that this may have been one of the factors driving the wide range in the prevalence rates seen in their findings. They wrote that future studies \u201cwould benefit from improved and consistently used definitions\u201d of the term. They also advocated for researchers to investigate religious ideologies\u2019 contributions to the persistence of the practice.

        "title": "Striking Kaiser Permanente workers say patients and employees are suffering amid staffing shortages",
        "content": "AURORA, Colorado \u2014 From coast to coast Wednesday, more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers picketed outside of health care facilities, arguing that staffing shortages have reached crisis levels for employees and patients alike. The strike, which the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions has said is the largest work stoppage of health care workers in U.S. history, was on display from California to Virginia, with workers walking out at 6 a.m. local time.  The striking workers include a wide array of professionals, including vocational nurses, ultrasound sonographers, respiratory therapists, emergency department technicians, housekeepers and more. The majority of striking workers were in California, according to a representative: 60,000 from the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and an additional 5,000 from the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 30 in San Diego.  In Sacramento just before 7:30 a.m. PT, striking workers lined the street outside of a medical center, holding signs that read \u201cKaiser workers won\u2019t be silenced\u201d and \u201cRespect and value health care workers.\u201d Some shook tambourines, rang yellow bells or banged on pots. Many drivers honked in support as they passed by. On the other side of  the country, outside of the Kaiser Permanente Springfield Medical Center in Springfield, Virginia, workers chanted, \u201cHey Kaiser, come on out, we\u2019ve got something to talk about!\u201d Some were dressed in white coats as they marched. Sarah Levesque, the secretary-treasurer for OPEIU Local 2, told NBC News\u2019 Tom Costello that workers were \u201clooking for Kaiser executives to come to the table and bargain in good faith over the short-staffing crisis.\u201d She said there were about 180 optometrists and pharmacists striking in Springfield. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the staff to adequately take care of our patients,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cThese people got into health care because they wanted to take care of patients and they\u2019re just stretched too thin. It\u2019s taking up to three months to get appointments with some of the doctors.\u201d David Hawa, an ambulatory care pharmacist in Springfield, echoed those concerns. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough pharmacists to deliver the health care needed for our patients,\u201d he said.   The result of that, he said, is \u201clonger lines, cancellation of appointments. frustrated customers on the phone or in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the best we can do, and it\u2019s not fair for our patients,\u201d he said. The same sentiment prompted workers to strike in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed and patients have to wait more than a month to be seen,\u201d said Lorena Jackson, who works in scheduling in primary care. \u201cBy then, you\u2019re either feeling better, dead or you have to pay more money out-of-pocket to visit urgent care.\u201d Employees said they were also protesting for more wages in light of skyrocketing housing prices in Colorado. \u201cThe price of living is too high and these companies need to start paying accordingly,\u201d said Lavette Clardy, who also works in scheduling and is a labor union member with SEIU Local 105. \u201cPeople are here risking their lives and can\u2019t afford a work-life balance and enjoy their families.\u201d  Based in Oakland, California, Kaiser Permanente is a nonprofit health system that serves nearly 13 million people in its 39 hospitals and more than 600 medical facilities nationwide, according to its website. The health care worker strike comes amid a swell of recent work stoppages across various professions, including autoworkers and the entertainment industry. The strike, set to last up to three days in some areas of the country, came after labor negotiators and Kaiser Permanente failed to reach a new contract deal before the previous agreement expired on Saturday. Talks are ongoing, according to a spokesperson for Kaiser Permanente, who said in a statement after the strike began that \u201cthere has been a lot of progress, with agreements reached on several specific proposals late Tuesday.\u201d The spokesperson added that hospitals, emergency rooms and pharmacies would remain open during the walkout. The strike began in Washington, D.C., and Virginia at 6 a.m. ET before expanding to Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. The coalition said workers were taking action to \u201cprotest Kaiser executives\u2019 bad faith bargaining, which is getting in the way of finding solutions to solve the Kaiser short-staffing crisis by investing in its workforce.\u201d Elizabeth Chuck reported from New York.

        "title": "Discrimination may disrupt how the brain and the gut talk to each other, raising risk of obesity, study finds",
        "content": "Experiencing discrimination may change how the brain and the gut communicate with each other, a new study has found. The disruption, the researchers say, could promote behaviors that increase people\u2019s risk of obesity. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Mental Health, included more than 100 participants, mostly women, who filled out questionnaires to gauge their experiences of discrimination in their day-to-day lives. The participants then underwent brain scans as they were being shown pictures of sugary and fatty foods, such as cake and ice cream, along with pictures of lower-sugar and low-fat foods like fruit and salad. They also provided fecal samples so the researchers could study their gut microbiome. In individuals who reported experiencing high levels of discrimination, the photos of unhealthy, high-calorie foods triggered a larger response in the reward processing region of the brain, called the frontal-striatal region. This part of the brain is also involved with motivation and executive control.  That heightened response can lead people to reach for sugar and high-fat foods, the researchers said. Sugar is highly addictive and is often craved by people undergoing stress, including from discrimination, as a means to provide comfort, said Arpana Gupta, an associate professor-in-residence of medicine at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and senior author of the study. \u201cWhen you\u2019re feeling sad and you\u2019re feeling upset, what do you see on TV \u2014 that girl going to grab that tub of ice cream,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when we\u2019re stressed, we crave these foods. We go for these foods for comfort. What our study was able to do was that it was able to show this at the brain level, as well as the gut level.\u201d At the gut level, she said, the study found that people who reported higher levels of discrimination had higher levels of the compounds known as glutamate metabolites. These compounds are associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which can damage cells and DNA.  Glutamate metabolites from the gut also play a major role in the function of the brain, Gupta said. Too much can affect regions of the brain related to cognition, leading to difficulty controlling cravings and responses to high-calorie foods among people who experience discrimination, Gupta said.  An excess of glutamate in the body can also lead to a deposition of body fat, especially in the abdominal region, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, professor of medicine and division lead for women, diversity, equity and inclusion at Sidney Kimmel Medical College in Philadelphia. It can also increase a person\u2019s craving for sugar and fatty foods, according to Choudhary, who was not involved with the new study. Aside from putting a person at the risk of obesity, the study found that glutamate may also be involved in the biological mechanisms behind depression and anxiety-related disorders.  However, Gupta said that more research is needed to more accurately measure glutamate in the brain.  There is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the brain and the gut that goes beyond just a connection, said  Dr. Pankaj Pasricha, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. The brain receives information and provides feedback to the gut, for example, by sending signals to stop eating when a person\u2019s stomach is full.  While external stressors like discrimination can impact the gut, Pasricha said not everyone who experiences stress develops an overt health issue \u2014 and that both genetics and environment play a role. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about the gut as being exposed to the exterior, but in reality, it is,\u201d Pasricha, who was not involved with the new research, said. \u201cIt just happens to be in our belly. It\u2019s got an opening on both ends and it\u2019s constantly being exposed to environmental factors. So, the gut becomes important.\u201d Increased stress, he added, can break down the gut barrier, which can trigger inflammation and even autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Choudhary said that chronic stress can even exacerbate already existent gastrointestinal issues, including irritable bowel syndrome. And even at a low, constant level, discrimination \u201ccan cause chronic stress,\u201d she added. When it comes to people\u2019s cravings for sugar, they could stem from childhood experiences, conditioned reflexes and memory, Pasricha said. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of our genetics, a combination of our social and cultural experiences \u2014 the bad stuff, like discrimination \u2014 and some of the good stuff,\u201d Pasricha said. \u201cWe remember what our mother used to cook for us, and we find joy in going back.\u201d The new study didn\u2019t look at the links between discrimination and race or ethnicity.  However, Gupta\u2019s previous research has found differences in how the brain and gut respond to discrimination depending on the race and ethnicity of the individual. In a 2022 study, Gupta and her colleagues reported that among Black and Hispanic individuals, discrimination was linked to changes in the brain associated with psychological coping and increased inflammation, while in white people, discrimination was linked to anxiety, but not inflammation. Among Asian individuals, the study found a link between discrimination and behavioral changes. In an ideal world, Gupta said, the best way to address the risks presented in the study is to fight discrimination through policy changes.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that discrimination is going to go away,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away in my lifetime. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away in my kid\u2019s lifetime. So, what we need to do in the interim is do other things that can help us cope better with discrimination.\u201d  She advised that people take a multipronged approach by managing stress and being aware of their eating habits. Eating anti-inflammatory foods and probiotics can also help manage gut health. Pasricha said innovations in medicine, including drugs like Ozempic, may also be a solution to help control eating habits. While it is \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to change human behavior, he said it is important to address social determinants of health, which can lead to inequalities in health care, delivery and access. \u201cAs a society, we must recognize that these problems begin very early on,\u201d he said, \u201cand we must reduce the stressors that, if not mitigated or are prevented, will leave a permanent effect on the circuitry of the developing and vulnerable brain.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "More than 75,000 workers to strike at hundreds of Kaiser Permanente health facilities across U.S.",
        "content": "Workers at Kaiser Permanente \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest health care nonprofit organization \u2014 began a strike Wednesday morning that is set to within hours see more than 75,000 union members walk out of hospitals and medical offices after the company and labor negotiators failed to resolve a dispute over staffing levels. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions has described the work stoppage as the largest strike of health care workers in U.S. history. The strike will target Kaiser hospitals and medical offices serving California, Colorado, Oregon, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Washington state. The strike began at 6 a.m. ET in D.C. and Virginia. Other workers will be scheduled to walk out at 6 a.m. local time in the remaining states. The striking workers include vocational nurses, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, X-ray technicians, respiratory therapists, medical assistants, pharmacists and hundreds of other positions. Kaiser Permanente serves nearly 13 million patients and operates 39 hospitals and more than 600 medical offices across eight states and the District of Columbia. Kaiser said it has contingency plans to ensure patients continue to receive care during a strike. The strike by Kaiser Permanente employees is the latest action by organized labor this year as inflation and a workforce shortage have brought tensions over pay, benefits and staffing to a boiling point. More than 25,000 members of the United Auto Workers are currently on strike against Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis. Hollywood writers staged a 150-day walkout that came to an end last week after they secured a pay increase and improved benefits. The unions at Kaiser are demanding long-term investments to address a staffing shortage in addition to better pay and benefits. Caroline Lucas, executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, said the staffing crisis has led to unsafe working conditions and deteriorating care for patients. \u201cWe continue to have front-line health care workers who are burnt out and stretched to the max and leaving the industry,\u201d Lucas told CNBC. \u201cWe have folks getting injured on the job because they\u2019re trying to do too much and see too many people and work too quickly. It\u2019s not a sustainable situation.\u201d Hospitals have long struggled to retain staff because workers tend to leave the low pay and the high stress of the health care field when unemployment is low, according to Patricia Pittman, an expert at the Milken Institute School of Public Health. The devastating toll of the covid pandemic has compounded the staffing shortage, Pittman said. Many workers left the field because they felt the administration was not doing enough to protect them from both the virus and antagonism from some members of the community, she said. \u201cThe health care workers lived through a period of tremendous fear and uncertainty about themselves, their families, and often did not feel supported by the administration and often did not feel supported by the community,\u201d Pittman said. Kaiser Permanente this week acknowledged the stress that health care workers are facing. More than 5 million people have left their health care jobs and burnout is at a record high, the company said in a statement Monday. Kaiser said it is committed to a fair and equitable agreement. But the union coalition said management failed to adequately address workers\u2019 concerns about unsafe staffing levels. The three-day strike is a protest against Kaiser executives\u2019 \u201cbad faith bargaining,\u201d the coalition said in a statement Tuesday. Kaiser reported a profit of $2 billion in the second quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.2 billion. The nonprofit generated $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter. ",

        "title": "Weeks into the Covid booster rollout, parents of young children say the shots are scarce",
        "content": "Like many parents of small children, Amber van Moessner has caught Covid-19 from her two kids twice. Last December, van Moessner's younger son was the first to get sick. At 4 months old, he was too young to get vaccinated. Eventually, the rest of the family got Covid as well. So she was excited when the Food and Drug Administration cleared a new round of updated booster shots on Sept. 11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the booster for people 6 months and older. But like a lot of parents, van Moessner hasn\u2019t been able to get her children vaccinated. Pharmacies near where her family lives in Kinderhook, in New York's Hudson Valley, aren't taking many appointments for children because they have fewer child-size doses, if any. What's more, van Moessner said she has had trouble getting answers about when doses might become available. \"I was hoping to be able to get my younger child vaccinated because he's never been eligible for a Covid shot,\" she said. \"Now I'm in this holding pattern.\" Neither van Moessner's pediatrician nor county health department could tell her when the vaccines would become available near her. She tried the vaccines.gov website, which said the vaccines were available at pharmacies near her. But the pharmacies' own websites said they didn't have it. And unlike the initial vaccine rollouts in 2020-21 and the prior booster rollout in 2022, there are not many pop-up clinics where children can get vaccinated. That\u2019s a problem for parents of the youngest children. Most states do not allow pharmacists to prescribe vaccines, and about half of them bar pharmacists from vaccinating children younger than 3. When the first Covid vaccines became available in late 2020, the federal government bought and distributed the vaccine doses to pharmacies and other providers. The same happened with the vaccine boosters in 2022. But that\u2019s not happening this year. \"This is the first time that there's been a move to the commercial vaccine market, so there were some difficulties even for adults that were caused by insurers and sometimes pharmacies,\" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the nonprofit research organization KFF. The vaccine rollouts under the government's watch had issues, too. But Cox said the current one has been marked by confusion about insurance coverage rules, supplies and appointment availability. The vaccines also have to be refrigerated at specific temperatures before they can be administered, and that could be a problem for pediatricians' offices. The biggest problem, Cox theorized, is that providers don't want to waste money by ordering doses that won't be used. \"Providers have to pay upfront for the cost of the dose, and they have to hope there\u2019s enough demand to access it,\" she said. \"There\u2019s a financial incentive to underestimate demand, or not even purchase it if you think there\u2019s too much chance of parents not bringing their children in.\" That applies to all Covid vaccines this time around. But children require smaller vials of the vaccines than adults. Providers have to decide how much of each of those they want to buy. And vaccination rates for children have consistently been lower than for adults. According to a poll by KFF, about two-thirds of parents with children under age 12 say they won't get them vaccinated against Covid. Still, that leaves millions of parents who want to get their children vaccinated, and who are having a hard time doing it. And they're frustrated about it. \"It\u2019s entirely on us to make sure that we are getting the right vaccine and hunting it down,\" van Moessner said. \"Parents through Covid are immensely on their own.\" Yuen Kwan, a medical interpreter in metro Boston, was also frustrated by her experiences. She said she works at a pediatric hospital that, so far, hasn\u2019t been able to secure pediatric doses. \u201cI don\u2019t personally know anyone who has been able to get their child vaccinated,\u201d she said. \u201cA couple of kids in my son\u2019s class already caught Covid the last couple of weeks.\u201d Kwan said she is especially concerned about her 80-year-old mother, whom her family sees often. But if the situation doesn\u2019t improve, she said she is worried it\u2019s just a matter of time before someone in her family gets sick. \u201cI feel like a sitting duck,\u201d she said. Those problems aren't only affecting young children. Erin Belieu, a poet and a professor at the University of Houston, said she and her son are both considered high-risk for severe Covid. She wanted to help him get vaccinated, but struggled to find doses near his small-town college in Ohio. \"It becomes a part-time job, just trying to find vaccines for your children,\" Belieu said. \"I called something like 15 pharmacies, and I finally found a sympathetic person who answered the phone and who gave me the tip that if you go to one of the CVS [locations] inside of a Target, people don\u2019t really know they\u2019re there,\" meaning they might have extra doses. Belieu said her son drove 30 miles to one such CVS location to get vaccinated. But she and van Moessner both noted that they had more time and resources than most people to try to track down vaccine doses. \"It's really frustrating that nobody seems to have the wherewithal to do a vaccine rollout three years into this,\" van Moessner said. \"I just find that unacceptable.\" Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Parents in Pakistan could face prison time for not vaccinating their kids against polio",
        "content": "KARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 Authorities in one Pakistan province are turning to a controversial new tactic in the decades-long initiative to wipe out polio: prison. Last month, the government in Sindh introduced a bill that would imprison parents for up to one month if they fail to get their children immunized against polio or eight other common diseases. Experts at the World Health Organization and elsewhere worry the unusual strategy could further undermine trust in the polio vaccines, particularly in a country where many believe false conspiracies about them and where dozens of vaccinators have been shot and killed. Adding to the problems faced by experts trying to persuade people of the vaccines\u2019 safety: The oral vaccines themselves now cause most polio cases worldwide. WHO\u2019s polio director in the Eastern Mediterranean warned the new law could backfire. \u201cCoercion is counterproductive,\u201d said Dr. Hamid Jafari. He said health workers have typically succeeded in raising immunization rates in vaccine-hesitant areas by figuring out the reasons for people\u2019s refusal and addressing those concerns, like bringing in a trusted political or religious leader to talk with people. \u201cMy own sense is that Pakistan wants to have this legislation in their back pocket in case they need it,\u201d Jafari said. \u201cI would be surprised if there\u2019s a willingness to actually enforce these coercive measures.\u201d Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only countries where the spread of polio has never been stopped. The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children up to age 5 and typically spreads in contaminated water. WHO and its partners have administered billions of vaccine doses since they first began trying to eradicate the disease in 1988. The effort costs nearly $1 billion a year and is largely funded by donor countries and private organizations including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The immunizations, given to children as drops in the mouth, have reduced polio cases by more than 99%. But in very rare cases, the live virus in the vaccine can cause polio or mutate into a strain that triggers a new outbreak. So far this year, there have been seven cases of polio caused by the wild virus \u2014 all in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, more than 270 cases have been caused by a virus linked to the vaccine in 21 countries across three continents. In January, roughly 62,000 parents, mostly in Pakistan\u2019s Sindh province, refused polio vaccinations for their children, prompting authorities there to propose the new law with penalties. The bill is in the final stages of becoming law after the provincial assembly approved it in August. It would punish parents with up to a month in prison for failing to vaccinate their children against certain diseases; they could also be fined up to 50,000 rupees ($168). Officials said their primary aim was to boost polio immunization rates, though diseases including measles, pneumonia and pertussis are also in the legislation. Rukhsana Bibi, a health worker in Karachi, hopes the new law will reduce vaccine refusal rates and protect health workers. Karachi is considered at high risk for a polio resurgence. Bibi noted that in the past, abusive or threatening parents have been detained by police. They were released on the condition that they have their children immunized, and that they help the polio team with outreach efforts. There are multiple factors fueling vaccine hesitation in Pakistan. Many people are suspicious of the outside entities funding the vaccines and of the Pakistan government itself. Some \u201cfringe elements\u201d believe in a false conspiracy theory \u2014 that the vaccines are part of a plot by Western outsiders to sterilize people, Bibi acknowledged. But many parents would prefer that the government provide better health care, food or financial assistance. \u201cParents believe that\u2019s because the government gets grants and donations for such vaccines, so it keeps focusing on (the polio vaccines) instead of providing basic health care,\u201d Bibi said. \u201cIt makes parents suspicious.\u201d The public\u2019s already-shaken confidence in vaccine drives also took a dive in 2011, when the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency set up a fake hepatitis vaccination program in an attempt to gather intel on former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden. Militants have also gunned down health workers distributing vaccines and sent suicide bombers to blow up the police vehicles protecting them. Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was disheartening that people were so mistrustful of the government that they didn\u2019t believe the polio vaccine was in their children\u2019s best interests. \u201cI don\u2019t think in this kind of situation that throwing parents in jail is going to help,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only does it not work, but it\u2019s likely to ramp up the anger.\u201d Larson drew a comparison to COVID-19 vaccine mandates implemented in countries including Australia, Britain, France and the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because when you\u2019re talking about a (vaccine) that comes with a risk, even if it\u2019s a very small one, can you force this and make people take it?\u201d Larson asked. In some parts of Sindh province, the refusal rate for the polio vaccine is as high as 15%, according to a government official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. To eradicate polio, more than 95% of the population needs to be immunized. The Sindh official said parents would be penalized for refusing the vaccine, but doses wouldn\u2019t be administered to their children without their consent. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said it would be extremely challenging to rebuild trust with punitive measures. \u201cThe oral polio vaccine is not the best vaccine, but it\u2019s still much better than not getting the vaccine at all,\u201d Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately the job of governments to stand up for children and we know that if we don\u2019t vaccinate a certain percentage of children, that polio will always come back.\u201d Last year, the virus was detected in rich countries including Britain, Israel and the U.S. for the first time in nearly a decade. Muhammad Akhtar, the father of three children in Karachi, said he believes in the importance of polio vaccination because his cousin was sickened by the disease. But Akhtar disagrees with the idea of punishing people, saying parents should be able to choose which vaccines their children receive. Another father, Khan Muhammad, of Benaras Town near Karachi, is among those who believe in the false conspiracy theories. He has seven children and argues that polio is just like any other debilitating disease. \u201cAllah blessed us with these children and he alone will protect them,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s God\u2019s will.\u201d ",

        "title": "FDA authorizes Novavax's updated Covid vaccine",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday authorized an updated version of Novavax's Covid vaccine, allowing doses to begin shipping to doctors' offices and pharmacies across the country. Anyone age 12 and older can get a dose of the new vaccine, regardless of whether they were previously vaccinated, the FDA said in a statement. Just like Pfizer and Moderna's updated vaccines, Novavax's new shot is tailored to fight the XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant, a close relative of the currently circulating strains. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna, however, Novavax\u2019s shot doesn\u2019t use mRNA technology; instead, it relies on a protein-based technology to train the immune system to fight the virus that causes Covid. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on the updated vaccines, including Novavax's. As of Sept. 27, more than 2 million people had gotten the updated vaccines, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The signoff comes as the Biden administration is encouraging vaccinations to combat a potential winter spike in Covid cases. At the same time, people are being met with hurdles to getting the new vaccines, including unexpected insurance issues \u2014 even though the shots are supposed to be covered. In a statement Tuesday, Novavax said it expects doses will be available in thousands of locations across the United States, including in pharmacies and physicians\u2019 offices, sometime next week.

        "title": "More Latinas are living in states with abortion bans and restrictions",
        "content": "Latinas remain the largest group of women of color in the nation impacted by current or likely state abortion bans more than a year after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last summer. A new analysis from the National Partnership for Women & Families and the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, first shared with NBC News, found that close to 6.7 million Latinas (43% of all Latinas ages 15-49) live in 26 states that have banned or are likely to ban abortions. That's 200,000 more Latinas than last year when the organizations estimated that almost 6.5 million Latinas were threatened by state abortion bans. Three-quarters of the Latinas who live in states with abortion bans or restrictions are concentrated in Texas, Florida and Arizona, according to the report. They make up almost one-third of all Latinas of reproductive age in the nation. Texas, where abortions are banned, is home to 2.9 million Latinas of reproductive age. Florida and Arizona, where abortions are restricted, are home to 1.4 million and 585,600 Latinas of reproductive age, respectively. More providers, centers and clinics that have long served as entry points for women to receive affordable reproductive health care services such as birth control and maternity care have been closing down in states riddled with abortion bans and restrictions, Lupe Rodr\u00edguez, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, told NBC News. \u201cThe conditions on the ground and politically have actually gotten worse in many states,\u201d  she said. \"There hasn\u2019t really been any change in terms of shifting the the political and legislative landscape to make it so that anything might have gotten better.\u201d Twenty-six states, most of them in the South and the Midwest, have banned or significantly restricted abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy nongovernmental organization tracking reproductive rights. Abortions remain protected in some capacity in 24 states. More than 3.1 million Latinas affected by these current and future abortion bans are already mothers, according to the report. About 27% of them have children under age 3. Denying women abortion care may have a negative impact on their children's economic security and development, a study found. Another study found that women who had been denied abortion access experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than women who had received care. The growing lack of reproductive health and abortion access can increasingly cause mothers and their families to face poorer health outcomes, according to Rodr\u00edguez, as more people are forced to travel across multiple state lines to access care in a timely manner. This is a difficult task, she added, considering the costs of travel and child care for their children. There are also added risks for those who lack legal immigration status and may face the risk of deportation if they travel more than 100 miles into the interior where Border Patrol checkpoints are set up. More than 3 million Latinas in states where abortion is becoming increasing inaccessible were \u201ceconomically insecure\u201d or living in families below 200% of the federal poverty line, according to the report. More than 1.4 million Latinas in the 26 states surveyed work in the service industry. Such jobs often have low wages and lack access to health insurance and paid leave, among other benefits, complicating their ability to afford and access abortions and other forms of reproductive health care. \"The report also speaks to how economic justice is so connected to reproductive justice,\u201d said Candace Gibson, director of government relations at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, and co-author of the report. \u201cWe can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d These restrictions on abortion and reproductive health access are happening as many Latino children and their families were hit harder by the expiration of a temporary expansion of the child tax credit. That program provided parents nationwide a small financial reprieve from the Covid pandemic\u2019s economic turbulence, as well as the end of federal child care funding, Katherine Gallagher Robbins, another report co-author, pointed out. \"Right now, families, and in particular Latinx families, are just being hit on every front, when it comes to that nexus of reproductive and economic justice,\" she said. The harms of abortion bans are further exacerbated by misinformation and disinformation aimed at Hispanic communities, often spreading falsehoods about the legality of abortion and the health implications of the procedure.  While that's \"a bleak picture for a lot of families,\" Rodr\u00edguez emphasized the work of abortion funds and other networks continuing to help people with abortion needs despite the challenges. Changing the law to restore abortion access \"is obviously essential,\" said report co-author Shaina Goodman. \"But it is also about addressing long-standing systemic barriers to equality and to equity, everything from access to affordable health care to having culturally competent providers.\" Nicole Acevedo is a reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Drugmakers agree to negotiate drug prices with government, White House says",
        "content": "Major drug companies including Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb have committed to participate in Medicare drug price negotiations with the federal government, the Biden administration said Tuesday. The move is a positive step for people on Medicare, although there are still lawsuits from drug companies fighting the price negotiations. The final prices aren\u2019t expected until next year, and older people won\u2019t see the benefits until 2026. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services named the first 10 prescription drugs subject to price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act a little over a month ago. They include Eliquis and Xarelto, two blood thinners; Januvia, a diabetes drug; and Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis. Last year, about 9 million Medicare enrollees spent $3.4 billion out of pocket on the 10 selected drugs, according to the administration. Under the new law, Medicare for the first time will be able to directly haggle with drugmakers over prices for the costliest medications to drive down the high cost of prescription drugs for older people. Medicare provides health insurance coverage to 65 million people in the U.S., according to KFF, a nonpartisan group that studies health policy issues. The government will start negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies next year, and the negotiated prices will go into effect in 2026. More drugs will be added in the coming years. The Biden administration gave the manufacturers of the first 10 selected drugs a month to decide whether they would participate in the negotiations or face tax penalties. The tax could be lifted if a drugmaker chooses to pull its drug from the Medicare program entirely. Doing so, however, would cut the company off from a huge share of the market.  In June, Merck announced a lawsuit against the federal government over the negotiation provision. Other drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, have since filed similar suits. The companies say allowing Medicare to negotiate prices would lead to lower profits, causing drugmakers to reduce spending in research and development.

        "title": "U.S. health officials propose using a cheap antibiotic as a 'morning-after pill' against STDs",
        "content": "U.S. health officials plan to endorse a common antibiotic as a morning-after pill that gay and bisexual men can use to try to avoid some increasingly common sexually transmitted diseases. The proposed CDC guideline was released Monday, and officials will move to finalize it after a 45-day public comment period. With STD rates rising to record levels, \u201cmore tools are desperately needed,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The proposal comes after studies found some people who took the antibiotic doxycycline within three days of unprotected sex were far less likely to get chlamydia, syphilis or gonorrhea compared with people who did not take the pills after sex. The guideline is specific to the group that has been most studied \u2014 gay and bisexual men and transgender women who had a STD in the previous 12 months and were at high risk of contracting one again. There\u2019s less evidence that the approach works for other people, including heterosexual men and women. That could change as more research is done, said Mermin, who oversees the CDC\u2019s STD efforts. Even so, the idea ranks as one of only a few major prevention measures in recent decades in \u201ca field that\u2019s lacked innovation for so long,\u201d said Mermin. The others include a vaccine against the HPV virus and pills to ward off HIV, he said. Doxycycline, a cheap antibiotic that has been available for more than 40 years, is a treatment for health problems including acne, chlamydia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The CDC guidelines were based on four studies of using doxycycline against bacterial STDs. One of the most influential was a New England Journal of Medicine study earlier this year. It found that gay men, bisexual men and transgender women who previously contracted STDs and who took the pills were about 90% less likely to get chlamydia, about 80% less likely to get syphilis and more than 50% less likely to get gonorrhea compared with people who didn\u2019t take the pills after sex. A year ago, San Francisco\u2019s health department began promoting doxycycline as a morning-after prevention measure. With infection rates rising, \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel like we could wait,\u201d said Dr. Stephanie Cohen, who oversees the department\u2019s STD prevention work. Some other city, county and state health departments \u2014 mostly on the West Coast \u2014 followed suit. At Fenway Health, a Boston-based health center that serves many gay, lesbian and transexual clients, about 1,000 patients are using doxycycline that way now, said Dr. Taimur Khan, the organization\u2019s associate medical research director. The guideline should have a big impact, because many doctors have been reluctant to talk to patients about it until they heard from the CDC, Khan said. The drug\u2019s side effects include stomach problems and rashes after sun exposure. Some research has found it ineffective in heterosexual women. And widespread use of doxycycline as a preventive measure could \u2014 theoretically \u2014 contribute to mutations that make bacteria impervious to the drug. That kind of antibiotic resistance hasn\u2019t materialized in San Francisco, but it will be important to watch for, Cohen said.   ",

        "title": "Pregnant with no OB-GYNs around: In Idaho, maternity care became a casualty of its abortion ban",
        "content": "If you\u2019re pregnant in Bonner County, Idaho, you\u2019ll likely spend a lot of time on Route 95.  Bonner General Health, a 25-bed hospital, discontinued obstetrics, labor and delivery services this year. So for residents, Route 95 is the way to the closest in-state hospital with obstetrics care, which is at least an hour\u2019s drive south \u2014 or longer in the snowy winter. The hospital, which staffed the county\u2019s only OB-GYNs, cited the state\u2019s \u201clegal and political climate\u201d as one of the reasons it shuttered the department. Abortion has been banned in Idaho, with few exceptions, since August 2022. Laura Olin, 32, lives in the city of Sandpoint, where Bonner General is, and gave birth to her twin boys at the hospital in 2020. When she became pregnant again, she opted to deliver her daughter in Spokane, Washington \u2014 90 minutes away \u2014 in August. As the reality of doing the drive while in labor set in, she said, \u201cit was very scary those last few weeks of pregnancy.\u201d It made her think differently about her previous birth experience, Olin added. \u201cTo go into labor at home and arrive at the hospital five minutes later was a blessing that I didn\u2019t know was a blessing,\u201d she said. The four OB-GYNs who previously worked at Bonner General, meanwhile, have left Idaho to practice in states where abortion is legal. All four told NBC News that the state\u2019s ban contributed to their decisions to move.  As a whole, the situation has left mothers-to-be in Bonner County to contend with an unexpected consequence of their state\u2019s abortion policy: reduced access to medical care for women whose pregnancies are very much wanted.  Olin is one of a half-dozen pregnant or recently pregnant women who spoke to NBC News about how the closing of Bonner General\u2019s maternity department upended their birth plans and disrupted their lives. They say further travel times have introduced logistical burdens, financial difficulties, stress and anxiety.  \u201cI really feel like it\u2019s inevitable that there will be poor outcomes for women and babies who now have to travel longer to care in those emergency situations,\u201d said Elizabeth Smith, 35, a lactation consultant in Bonner County who has opted to deliver her baby \u2014 due in December \u2014 at a nearby birth center with a midwife. Delivering with a midwife is the only local option left in Bonner County. Smith said that as a former neonatal intensive care nurse, she would have preferred a hospital but that traveling for appointments and labor would require someone to watch her four children.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like that was an option for me given my large family and the need for child care,\u201d she said. Research has shown that women who lack access to hospitals with obstetrics care are more likely to face health consequences, including a higher risk of preterm birth, which is associated with asthma, hearing loss, intellectual disabilities and other lifelong impacts for children. An analysis published in 2019 found that rural residents had a 9% greater chance of maternal morbidity and mortality compared to urban residents, in part because of limited access and longer travel times to obstetrics care. (Women of color had at least 33% higher odds of those negative outcomes than white women regardless of where they lived, according to the research.) Olin, a supporter of abortion rights, said the ripple effects of Idaho\u2019s policies still caught her by surprise. She decided to cross state lines to deliver her daughter, she added, out of fear that abortion restrictions could affect her care if complications arose. \u201cWhen it actually affected my pregnancy, I couldn\u2019t believe that that was happening,\u201d Olin said.  Her former OB-GYN at Bonner General, Dr. Morgan Morton, who now practices in Washington, said many of her former patients \u2014 including those with opposing political views to Olin\u2019s \u2014 shared that reaction. \u201cI definitely have patients that I know would\u2019ve been in support of these laws and now are very surprised at the downstream effects,\u201d she said.  Bonner General announced the closing of its obstetrics department in March, citing a lower patient volume and the loss of pediatricians as factors in the decision, alongside what a spokesperson recently described as \u201csome of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the country.\u201d Idaho law prohibits abortion at any stage, with exceptions only to save the life of the mother, ectopic or molar pregnancies and cases of rape or incest in which the incidents were reported to police and the pregnancies are terminated within the first trimester. In April, the state also became the first to criminalize some out-of-state travel for abortion, with a law that makes helping a minor cross state lines for that purpose punishable by two to five years in prison.  In a statement to NBC News, the Bonner General spokesperson said that the services were eliminated with \u201ca heavy heart\u201d and that hospital providers worked with patients to coordinate alternative plans and make the transition \u201cas easy as possible.\u201d \u201cWe hear the community and want desperately to meet their needs,\u201d the spokesperson said. Many former Bonner General patients now go to Kootenai Health in Coeur d\u2019Alene, which is the closest in-state hospital with OB-GYNs on staff. It is more than 40 miles from Sandpoint. In June, Kootenai Health recorded its highest number of births ever, according to Kim Jorgensen, the hospital\u2019s director of women\u2019s and children\u2019s services. \u201cWhen this closure was announced, we were getting a lot of calls from women asking, \u2018What do I do?\u2019\u201d Jorgensen said. Candice Funk, 34, is one of those patients. She moved from California to Sandpoint \u2014 and got pregnant \u2014 around the time Bonner General stopped providing obstetrics care.  Funk developed HELLP syndrome \u2014 a rare and life-threatening form of pre-eclampsia \u2014 during her last pregnancy, so this one is high-risk. That means she most likely would have had to go to Kootenai for her delivery and some appointments anyway. Even so, she said, there\u2019s a persistent worry: \u201cIn case of an emergency, what do I do?\u201d During her previous pregnancies in California, Funk was a 20- or 30-minute ride from the hospital, she said. This time, she\u2019s prepared to stay at the Ronald McDonald House \u2014 or an affordable hotel \u2014 in Coeur d\u2019Alene if she needs more frequent monitoring. \u201cI know how drastic my conditions can be,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully it won\u2019t be a surprise if something happens overnight.\u201d  Sandpoint resident Lauren Sanders, 34, who\u2019s due to deliver her second child in November, faced the type of situation Funk fears this summer: For a few days, she didn\u2019t feel fetal movement.  So Sanders got in the car for a \u201creally intense\u201d 45-minute ride to Kootenai. Throughout the drive, she said, she kept wondering: \u201cIs my baby still alive?\u201d  The drive to Bonner General would have taken five minutes. The Kootenai doctors determined that everything was fine and released Sanders after some monitoring. But if something goes wrong during her planned home birth with a midwife, she might wind up on another agonizing ride. \u201cI\u2019ve had to get comfortable in the discomfort in having a \u2018riskier\u2019 birth at home,\u201d Sanders said. Chronic, elevated stress and anxiety during pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure and heart disease for the pregnant woman, preterm birth, and asthma and behavioral problems in young children, studies suggest.  Katie Bradish, 36, said she shells out hundreds of dollars to go to prenatal appointments in Spokane, 90 minutes from her home. Each trip requires her to take time off her job as a vice president at a grilling supplies company, she said, and pay $200 for a babysitter to watch her 2-year-old daughter, plus gas money. In May, early in her pregnancy, Bradish began feeling sharp abdominal pain and decided to go to the Bonner General emergency room because of the distance she would have had to drive to reach an OB-GYN\u2019s office. The visit, which included an ultrasound scan and exam, showed no major problems, and she later received a bill for more than $475 out of pocket. The copay for an ultrasound appointment with an OB-GYN would have cost her $23, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a burden,\u201d Bradish said. \u201cThis is thousands of dollars we would have in our family\u2019s economy.\u201d  For low-income residents of Sandpoint, such travel brings particular challenges. Around 14% of the city\u2019s population live in poverty, which is above the state and national averages. Drs. Amelia Huntsberger, Kristin Algoe and Lindsay Conner \u2014 former Bonner OB-GYNs who now work in Oregon, New York and Colorado, respectively \u2014 each said some of their Sandpoint patients had to start strategizing about whose car they could borrow or how they would pay for gas to travel for maternity care after the department closed. Huntsberger, who was on the Idaho Health and Welfare Department\u2019s now-disbanded Maternal Mortality Review Committee, emphasized that poverty and maternal mortality are intertwined. In Idaho, she said, Medicaid recipients accounted for the majority of pregnancy-related deaths in recent years. Despite the committee\u2019s recommendations to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage to last 12 months, Idaho was one of just three states where legislators finished this year\u2019s session without doing so. \u201cA lot of those people for whom it\u2019s going to get harder, they don\u2019t have a lot of power,\u201d Huntsberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s no microphone readily accessible to them, so many of them are going to suffer in the shadows.\u201d  Olin said her birth experience in Spokane made her miss the care she got at Bonner General, where Morton was present throughout her 16-hour labor. At one point, the doctor even made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for Olin\u2019s husband, who is vegan and didn\u2019t have anything to eat. \u201cThey took such great care of us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe care was personal.\u201d  Krista Haller, a therapist in Sandpoint who works with pregnant and postpartum women, said she has heard similar sentiments from many local moms. Some lament the impact on their former doctors, Haller said, telling her: \u201cThese people are wonderful. They helped me so much in this very specific time of my life, and now they\u2019re being hurt by these laws.\u201d  The Bonner General spokesperson wrote that hospital leaders \u201csupport our providers who made the hard decision to move.\u201d  Haller said she has also counseled local mothers who are thinking about getting pregnant again but worry about doing so without easily accessible obstetrics care. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot scarier, and they\u2019re a lot more aware of the decision to have a child and whether or not it\u2019s worth it to move forward to have a child and go through that journey knowing that the health care just isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said.  Bradish said her biggest fear is about the timing of her due date in January \u2014 what she calls \u201cblizzard time,\u201d given that Sandpoint can get more than 30 inches of snow that month. She plans to stock up on \u201cshower curtains and some rubber gloves for the car,\u201d Bradish said, in case she winds up delivering on the drive to Spokane. \u201cThat may sound like a joke, but it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. Because Sandpoint has a birth center and local midwives, the area isn\u2019t technically among the more than 1,100 counties nationwide considered to be maternity care deserts by the nonprofit organization March of Dimes. Such places lack hospitals providing obstetrics care, birth centers, OB-GYNs and certified nurse midwives. In addition, an OB-GYN from the Kootenai Clinic began traveling to Sandpoint once a week in August to make it easier for residents to attend prenatal appointments and access gynecological care. That doctor sees nearly 30 patients a day in Sandpoint, a hospital spokesperson said. But 13 of Idaho\u2019s 44 counties are maternity care deserts. The number of those deserts has risen nationwide in the past few years, according to March of Dimes. They\u2019re more likely in states that have banned or restricted abortion, according to an analysis from the Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare research foundation. The month Bonner General made its announcement, another Idaho hospital, Valor Health, announced it was discontinuing labor and delivery services because of staff shortages, declining births and financial difficulties. A hospital in Oregon stopped providing obstetric services in August, as did one in Tennessee this month and four hospitals in California so far this year. The former Bonner General OB-GYNs are not the only doctors choosing to practice in states without strict abortion bans. A survey of third- and fourth-year medical students conducted this spring found that nearly 58% reported being \u201cunlikely or very unlikely to apply to a single residency program in a state with abortion restrictions.\u201d Data collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges shows that states with abortion bans had a 10.5% drop in applications for OB-GYN residencies this year. About 40% of OB-GYNs in states with abortion bans say they\u2019ve felt constraints in providing necessary medical care since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, which struck down constitutional protections for abortion, according to a survey published in June by the nonprofit research organization KFF. More than 60% said they\u2019re concerned about legal risk when they make decisions about the necessity of abortions. Carole Joffe, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said she sees Idaho as \u201cthe canary in the coal mine.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to see doctors fleeing these states that have banned abortion,\u201d Joffe said. Idaho state Sens. Todd Lakey and C. Scott Grow, the Republicans who co-sponsored Idaho\u2019s abortion trigger ban in 2020, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. State Rep. John Vander Woude, who chairs the House Health and Welfare Committee and co-sponsored the trigger ban, said he and other Republican legislators did not foresee all the ripple effects of the law. \u201cThere needs to be clearer guidelines on what becomes criminalized,\u201d he said, as well as broader exceptions to protect the health of the mother, not just her life.  \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, I think, right now, under the current language to recruit or try to keep them,\u201d Vander Woude said of the state\u2019s OB-GYNs.  Idaho state Rep. Julianne Young, who also co-sponsored the ban, added that lawmakers this year already \u201ctook steps to clear up concerns over things such as ectopic pregnancies and provide more clarity for health care providers\u201d and will continue to assess the medical community\u2019s concerns.   Bonner General\u2019s former OB-GYNs said they didn\u2019t take their decisions to leave Sandpoint lightly.  \u201cThinking about what our community has lost \u2014 that is gutting,\u201d Huntsberger said. Olin and her husband plan to follow the doctors\u2019 example: They hope to move out of the state within the year. Idaho isn\u2019t a place where she\u2019d want to be pregnant again, Olin said \u2014 or where she wants to raise a daughter. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to have a family, why would you move here?\u201d she said.

        "title": "Short bursts of activity, totaling less than 10 minutes, linked to lower risk of death",
        "content": "Even short bursts of physical activity \u2014 the kind that come from simple, daily tasks \u2014 can benefit people\u2019s health, according to a large study published Thursday in the journal The Lancet Public Health.  The research found that engaging in a few minutes of physical activity, such as walking, gardening or household chores, each day was linked to lower risks of heart attack, stroke and early death. People who made it a habit to move for 5 to 10 minutes a day enjoyed the most health benefits, but even those who got as little as 1 to 3 minutes of activity experienced some positive effects. \u201cEvery minute counts,\u201d said senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis, a professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, \u201ceven if that minute of physical activity is part of our daily routine.\u201d  The findings were based on data from more than 25,000 adults ages 42 to 78 in the United Kingdom who wore fitness trackers, similar to an Apple Watch or a Fitbit, every day for two years. Researchers also monitored participants\u2019 health records for almost eight years to find links between their physical activity and health outcomes.  People included in the analysis did not exercise or play a sport, and almost all the physical activity happened in periods lasting less than 10 minutes. The researchers found that these short bursts of physical activity throughout the day, lasting less than 10 minutes total, were linked to a 52% decrease in the risk of premature death, as well as a 41% decrease in the risks of heart attack and stroke, compared to getting no physical activity. While the total amount of activity to help health came in at under 10 minutes, the duration and the intensity of the activity still mattered: People who moved for a minimum of 2 minutes at a moderate or vigorous intensity, for example, saw more health benefits than those who moved for just 30 seconds at a low intensity.  Moderate intensity was defined as any activity during which a person found it challenging to sing but could still speak comfortably, Stamatakis said; vigorous intensity meant the person couldn\u2019t speak more than a few words.  Most people engaged in low to moderate physical activity, he said. However, there was a sweet spot to how much vigorous intensity was beneficial: about 10 seconds per minute. \u201cVigorous intensity is extremely powerful,\u201d Stamatakis said.  The study adds to evidence that regular physical activity can improve health and help prevent diseases. Pankaj Kapahi, a researcher at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California, said the findings make sense, noting that most centenarians are not \u201csuper athletes\u201d who exercise for several hours a day. \u201cSo an active lifestyle with short bursts of activity seems like a better recipe for a longer and healthier life,\u201d said Kapahi, who was not involved in the study.  High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, a popular exercise routine that involves short bursts of intense exercise with breaks in between, is rooted in the same principle, said Marc Roig, a physical and occupational therapy professor at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cFind the right spot between intensity and duration,\u201d he said. \u201cBouts of 10 minutes are ideal because they tap into all these pathways\u201d that the body uses to store and burn energy. Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, said the findings are important to keep in mind for people who work desk jobs, who often find themselves sitting for long stretches without interruption. \u201cBut a better approach may be to work on tasks for a period of time interrupted with dedicated periods of activity,\u201d she said.  Stamatakis said engaging in short bouts of physical activity could be helpful to people who are unwilling or unable to take part in structured exercise. \u201cThis is very, very promising,\u201d he said.

        "content": "Eagle Produce announced a voluntary recall of more than 6,500 cases of cantaloupes in 19 states and Washington D.C. due to potential salmonella contamination. The company initiated the recall after the Food and Drug Administration conducted a test on cantaloupe in a distribution center, according to the FDA. The Kandy brand whole cantaloupe involved in the recall have the UPC number code 4050 and lot codes 797901, 797900 and 804918, according to the FDA. They were distributed between Sept. 5 and Sept. 16 in various supermarkets in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, people with weakened immune systems and frail or older adults, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms of salmonellosis, an infection with the salmonella bacteria, include diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and fever. Symptoms typically begin between six hours and six days after infection, per the CDC, but some may not experience symptoms for weeks. According to the CDC, children under five, adults over 65, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are at the highest risk for severe infection. There have been no reported illnesses as of Wednesday, the FDA said. The FDA asks that customers who purchased the affected fruit should not eat it and dispose of them. Consumers with concerns about illness should contact a health care provider. No other products or lot codes were said to be affected by the recall, according to the FDA, and the company is cooperating with the FDA. ",

        "title": "These carbs might be a bigger weight gain villain than sugar",
        "content": "Avoiding weight gain in middle age doesn't require a complicated change in diet, a new study suggests. Researchers in the United States analyzed more than two decades of data from almost 137,000 people and found less weight gain among people who ate more whole grains, fruit and nonstarchy vegetables \u2014 such as broccoli, carrots and spinach \u2014 and fewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sugary drinks. The study, published Wednesday in the BMJ, shows \u201cthe quality of the carbohydrates in a person\u2019s diet is much more important than the amount,\u201d said its senior author, Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cYou want to increase whole grains and limit starchy vegetables.\u201d Until now, Willetts said, there hasn\u2019t been a study showing the impact of lowering the amount of refined grains, starchy vegetables and sugary drinks on weight gain. \u201cIs sugar the villain? It should be behind bars,\u201d he said. \u201cBut interestingly, there are bigger villains. Overall, starch is a bigger villain.\u201d Starchy foods include white bread and vegetables, such as peas, corn and potatoes. While this study looked at long-term weight gain, earlier research showed that better quality carbohydrates were associated with a lower risk of heart disease and certain cancers, Willett said. The study found less weight gain among people who avoided: These foods have a high glycemic index, which is a measure of the increase in blood sugar after consumption, Willett said. When a person eats a food like potatoes with a high glycemic index, the starch is easily and quickly absorbed, causing a spike in blood sugar leading to more fat being produced and stored. Many starchy foods are also low in fiber. Willett advised people to eat more: The sugars and starches in these foods take longer to be absorbed by the body, which means they have a much smaller immediate impact on blood sugar and thus lead to less fat being produced and stored, Willett said. To take a closer look at carbohydrate quality on weight gain, Willett and his colleagues examined participants enrolled in one of three long-term studies: the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, which has provided major research on women's health; the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II; and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which was developed to track men's health. At the outset, the participants in each were, on average, in their 40s, 50s or 60s. When they joined the research, they were free of chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cancer or heart disease. Researchers followed them for at least two decades. The researchers excluded from their analysis participants who were 65 or older at baseline because at that age, weight loss could be due to other factors associated with aging.   At the beginning and every two to four years, participants filled out questionnaires that asked about medical history, lifestyle and other health-related factors. They were also asked, every four years, to fill out a form that assessed diet. Overall, the average weight gain was 3.3 pounds every four years \u2014 which over an average of 24 years amounted to 19.4 pounds. The results showed that: In contrast: The findings were stronger in women than men and people who were already overweight or obese compared to those who were normal weight. Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the medical weight management program at NYU Langone Health, has seen similar results in her patients. \u201cI was glad to see this study,\u201d Lofton said. \u201cAnd I was surprised that no one had done it before.\u201d Lofton applauded the researchers for the large number of participants and the length of time those participants were followed. The findings underscore the value of eating not only whole grains, but also whole fruits and vegetables, she said. When fruits and vegetables are pureed, most of the fiber is lost, meaning smoothies aren\u2019t as healthy as people would like to think. she added. \u201cThink about it,\u201d said Lofton, who was not associated with the new study. \u201cA fruit is fiber, water, vitamins, minerals and natural sugars. When you turn it into juice, it\u2019s like taking vitamins and minerals and drinking Kool-Aid afterwards.\u201d She suggests pairing healthy carbohydrates with protein because it helps avoid a rapid spike in insulin, which can cause more weight gain and fat storage. Dr. Michelle Thompson, medical director of the UPMC Lifestyle Medicine in Pittsburgh, said the study\u2019s overall message is that people should be eating real food instead of processed foods.   \u201cOne of our biggest problems is that our families didn\u2019t teach us this,\u201d said Thompson, who is not associated with the new research. \u201cI grew up in an Italian American family where we ate a lot of pasta and meatballs. This led to obesity in my family and diabetes, hypertension and stroke.\u201d \u201cThe beauty of this study is the number of years it was going on,\u201d she said.  The study shows how important fiber is, said obesity specialist Dr. Sahar Takkouche, an assistant professor of medicine in the department of diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that when you remove fiber, it\u2019s easier to break down sugars in the mouth with the digestive enzymes in our saliva,\u201d said Takkouche, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cThat allows us to get a punch of glucose much faster and get a dopamine hit.\u201d And that effect is similar to what happens with substances of abuse.  It\u2019s not clear why the association between high starch diets and weight gain is stronger in women, she said. \u201cThe cause is likely related to hormones that may be making us more sensitive,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Insurance hurdles for new Covid vaccines have largely been resolved, Biden administration says",
        "content": "Last week, as the updated Covid vaccines rolled out to pharmacies across the U.S., some people eager to get their doses were met with unexpected insurance issues \u2014 even though the shots are supposed to be covered. On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services said the issue has been \"largely, if not completely,\" resolved. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra met earlier in the day with leading insurance companies, including CVS Health, UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna, to review the progress of the Biden administration\u2019s fall Covid vaccination campaign, agency spokesperson Jeff Nesbit said in an email. The insurance companies made it clear that they are \"fully covering the new vaccine shots,\" according to a rundown of the meeting shared by HHS. They described the problem of some people being denied coverage as \"systemic technical issues.\" One insurer, Aetna, said that going forward it would treat the new shot as a seasonal vaccination, meaning members can get Covid vaccinations wherever they get their annual flu shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on the updated Covid vaccines this month. For the first time since the first vaccines became available, the government is not covering the cost of the shots. Federal health officials had previously assured that the new shots would be provided at no cost for most people with insurance. However, reports quickly surfaced that some people were being told their insurance would not cover it. The insurance companies said they would continue to closely monitor reports of any \"technical or coding barriers to vaccine coverage,\" according to a letter shared with NBC News from AHIP, the industry's trade group. More than 2 million people had gotten the updated vaccines as of Wednesday, HHS said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.  Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Even short-term exposure to air pollution may raise risk of stroke",
        "content": "This past summer, wildfire smoke periodically blanketed the U.S., bringing stinging air and hazy skies to the Northeast and the Midwest, regions that are unaccustomed to the itchy eyes, scratchy throats and breathing problems that come from being downwind of such natural disasters. But with air pollution come more serious health problems, too. Among them, a meta-analysis published Wednesday in the journal Neurology finds, is exposure to air pollution that may increase a person\u2019s risk of stroke within five days.  \u201cAir pollution\u2019s impact on human health extends beyond the lung and eyes. It also involves the brain and cardiovascular system,\u201d said Dr. Ahmad Tubasi, a researcher with the faculty of medicine at the University of Jordan, who led the research. In the study, Tubasi and his team looked at data from 110 observational studies from Asia, Europe and North and South America. The studies looked at incidence of stroke, as well as the concentrations of common pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, present in the air within five days of people having a stroke.  They also looked at exposure to particulate matter \u2014 microscopic particles from dust, dirt, soot or smoke that can be harmful when inhaled. Particulate matter can range in size from less than 1 micron in diameter (referred to as PM1) to up to 10 times that size (PM10). In the U.S., vehicle emissions, burning fuel to heat homes, power plants and chemical production are the main sources of air pollution. Traffic is a key reason air pollution is usually worse in cities than in rural areas. Vehicles that burn gas release carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, which are dangerous on their own. But these compounds also react with sunlight to create ozone, usually called smog, which damages cells. Smoke from fires, including wildfires, is also a source of air pollution. The meta-analysis included more than 18 million cases of ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot traveling to the brain.  The researchers found that stroke risk was nearly 30% higher when people had been exposed to nitrogen dioxide up to five days prior. For carbon monoxide exposure, the risk was 26% higher; for sulfur dioxide, 15% higher; and for ozone exposure, 5% higher.   The risk of dying from a stroke also went up with exposure to certain pollutants, the meta-analysis found. Short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide was linked to a 33% increased risk of death from stroke, and for sulfur dioxide, a 60% increased risk. For particulate matter, the greatest increase was seen for PM2.5 particles, which are less than 2.5 microns in diameter. PM2.5 particle exposure was associated with a 15% increased risk of stroke, the study found. Exposure to increased amounts of PM1 was associated with a 9% greater risk of stroke, and exposure to increased amounts of PM10 was associated with a 14% greater risk. Breathing in particulate matter, especially the smaller molecules, causes inflammation and irritation in the lungs, which triggers the body\u2019s immune response, said Michael Kleinman, co-director of the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the study.   This creates a cascading effect that impacts the cardiovascular system, Kleinman said. \u201cThere is a direct link between what goes on in the lung and what goes on in the heart,\u201d he said.  When air pollution sets off the immune response, inflammation spreads throughout the body in an effort to fight off intruders. This inflammation causes the arteries and veins to constrict, creating a more narrow pathway for blood, clots and plaque. At the same time, the body increases production of thrombin, a clotting agent in the blood.  \u201cThe longer a person is exposed to air pollution, and the more intense the exposure, the greater the risk,\u201d said Dr. Julius Latorre, director of the Upstate University Hospital Comprehensive Stroke Center in Syracuse, New York, who was not involved with the new research. Since nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide molecules are so tiny, they are more likely to pass through the lung\u2019s filters and cause damage, either by irritating the lungs enough to cause an inflammatory response, or by making their way into the body\u2019s cells, Latorre said. This may be why these two pollutants were particularly linked with a greater risk of death from stroke, he added. Air pollution has long been linked to health issues, and Latorre said he\u2019s worried that as climate change creates more opportunities for air pollution, this will erase the progress the U.S. has made in recent years in preventing stroke deaths. \u201cWe are already battling the typical risk factors for stroke, such as obesity, hypertension and high cholesterol,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add increasing environmental exposure, that can be an epidemic on its own, increasing not just the stroke incidents, but stroke mortality.\u201d Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "content": "Bruce Springsteen will not be able to perform for the rest of this year, the rock icon announced Wednesday, as he continues to fight peptic ulcer disease. Earlier this month, the 74-year-old Springsteen called off a string of September shows in the hopes of recovering enough to resume touring with an eight-gig Canadian run starting Nov. 3 in Vancouver, British Columbia. \"Bruce Springsteen has continued to recover steadily from peptic ulcer disease over the past few weeks and will continue treatment through the rest of the year on doctor\u2019s advice,\" according to a statement from Springsteen and his E Street Band. \"With this in mind, and out of an abundance of caution, all remaining 2023 tour dates for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band will be postponed until 2024.\" Before Wednesday's announcement, Springsteen had also been set to perform later this year in Phoenix, San Diego, Inglewood, California, and San Francisco. For now, his next shows are set for Aug. 21 and 23, 2024, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. \"Rescheduled dates for each of the 2023 shows, including those postponed earlier this month, will be announced next week, all taking place at their originally scheduled venues,\" according to he band's statement. The Boss vowed to be back on stage in the new year. \u201cThanks to all my friends and fans for your good wishes, encouragement, and support,\" Springsteen said in a statement. \"I\u2019m on the mend and can\u2019t wait to see you all next year.\u201d Peptic ulcer disease is the wearing away of the stomach lining, which can be asymptomatic or cause debilitating pain. Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by exposure to a particular type of bacteria or by the regular use of a class of common painkillers, which includes ibuprofen, aspirin or naproxen. Those suffering from peptic ulcer disease are usually told to cut back on their use of pain medication and limit alcohol consumption. David K.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Banking Committee took a historic step Wednesday by advancing marijuana-related legislation to the floor for the first time. The legislation, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation Banking Act, would allow legal marijuana businesses to use major financial and banking institutions. The committee reported out the bill by a 14-9 vote with the support of Republicans Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Steve Daines of Montana and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Only one Democrat, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, voted against approving the bill for floor consideration. Under current federal law, banks and creditors can face federal prosecution if they provide services to businesses selling pot. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning that he would soon bring the legislation to the floor for full Senate consideration. Senators are then expected to have the chance to offer amendments. \"For too long, cannabis businesses have been forced to rely primarily on cash transactions, no credit or debit cards,\" Schumer said. \"Dealing only in cash stifles these businesses' growth, opens them up to so many risks, makes them easy targets for theft, robbery and other crimes. No industry has the ability to thrive if they can\u2019t access banking infrastructure, especially not an industry that\u2019s growing as quickly and is as new as the cannabis industry.\" In a statement, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that advancing the measure out of committee was a \"historic moment\" and that he is \"committed to building bipartisan momentum to finally get a bill signed into law that ends the cannabis cash economy and improves public safety across the nation.\" Even if the so-called SAFER Act passes in the Senate, its fate in the House is less certain. Some Republicans in leadership roles, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, have voted for the bill in previous years. Now in control of the gavel, McCarthy has not said whether he would prioritize the effort in this Congress given the slim majority that has complicated his tenure.

        "title": "Kids and teens are inundated with phone prompts, and doctors worry it could affect their development",
        "content": "Fourteen-year-old Armita Mojazza is a huge Harry Styles fan, and TikTok knows it. Videos of Styles are \"pretty much always\" showing up as Armita scrolls through the platform, she said \u2014 \"the feed obviously adjusts to your interests.\" Those videos, combined with notifications from Snapchat and other social media outlets, lure Armita, of White Plains, New York, into up to five hours of screen time on weekdays and at least eight hours on weekends, she said. Her mother, Shahrzad Mojazza, said she was shocked to learn how much time her daughter spends online. \"I feel like I'm waking up to this news,\" she said. A new report about kids and their smartphone use may offer other parents a warning: Children like Armita are inundated with hundreds of pings and prompts on their phones all day and all night \u2014 even when they should be paying attention in class or getting a good night's rest. It's a \"constant buzzing,\" said Jim Steyer, the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, a group that studies the impact of media and technology on kids and families. \"They literally wake up and before they go to the bathroom, they're on their phone.\" New research Common Sense Media released Tuesday finds about half of 11- to 17-year-olds get at least 237 notifications on their phones every day. About 25% of them pop up during the school day, and 5% show up at night. In some cases, they get nearly 5,000 notifications in 24 hours. The pop-ups are almost always linked to alerts from friends on social media. \"They're constantly forced to respond socially on Snapchat or TikTok or whatever to their friends,\" Steyer said. \"It's a dominant factor in all of their personal lives.\" Dr. Benjamin Maxwell, the interim director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, said he is \"immensely concerned\" by the findings. Such a \"highly stimulating environment\" may affect kids' \"cognitive ability, attention span and memory during a time when their brains are still developing,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cWhat are the long-term consequences? I don't think we know.\" Maxwell was not involved with the Common Sense report. The study is based on surveys of 203 young people ages 11 through 17. The subjects also agreed to install an app on their phones for nine days so researchers could track their smartphone use. The app provided time-stamped data about which apps were running and when, as well as the numbers of notifications that popped up. The social media apps tracked in the survey included TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and Discord. Fifty-nine percent of kids were online from midnight to 5 a.m. While some were engaging with social media, many were listening to music or white noise to wind down and get to sleep. The vast majority \u2014 97% \u2014 were on their phones during typical school hours. While prompts from smartphones could distract kids from paying attention in class, the report's authors did not suggest that schools should crack down on smartphone use or ban it altogether. \"This raises some questions about how schools can work with young people to help them have some control over their phone use,\" said the report\u2019s lead researcher, Dr. Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Many kids said they used their phones to communicate with parents during the school day. Others reported that time on their phones provided them with a way to \"disengage when their brain needed a rest,\" Radesky said. \"School feels hard and stressful for a lot of kids. The phone is one way that they give their brain a break.\" But the Common Sense study also found that many try to control their online activity by using the \"do not disturb\" settings on their smartphones. \"We definitely heard that as teens got older, they developed more of that sense of planning for when and how they wanted to use their phone,\" Radesky said. They realize that there are times when \"they don't want to feel bombarded with notifications or like their attention to be split.\" Still, the attraction to those notifications is irresistible to many teens, like Armita Mojazza. She sets limits on her screen time but admitted she reaches that limit \"all the freaking time.\" Steyer blames the business model of social media platforms like TikTok. Their goal \"is to keep you on the platform so they can sell you ads,\" he said. \"It's really an arms race for your attention.\" NBC News asked the four companies that own the most popular social media outlets highlighted in it about the new report. The experts at Common Sense suggest specific questions parents can ask their kids to learn more about their smartphone use: What is your favorite app right now? Who are your favorite people to follow on social media? Can you teach me how to use Snapchat (or another social media platform)? Steyer, a father of four, urges parents to remain nonjudgmental during such conversations and to be open about how much of their own time and attention they spend online and with social media apps. He also recommends reserving threats to take a child's phone away as punishment to extreme circumstances only. \"Even though as a parent I have done that many times,\" Steyer said, children may not be as open about what they do online if they are constantly afraid of losing their phones. \"Kids have this extraordinary experience of childhood and adolescence that we did not have, but we can really help them through this,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's good, old-fashioned, commonsense parenting that makes the difference.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

        "title": "Pediatric cancer drugs in shortage as drug supply crisis drags on",
        "content": "Pediatric cancer doctors are sounding the alarm about a growing shortage of chemotherapy drugs for children.  The dwindling supplies add another layer to the ongoing cancer drug shortage crisis that\u2019s left doctors scrambling and forced patients to make difficult choices about treatments since early February.   The Biden administration has taken steps to address the crisis, in some cases successfully: Doctors say that shortages of two cancer drugs, carboplatin and cisplatin, have eased significantly in recent weeks. However, reports from children\u2019s hospitals across the country are pointing to supply problems for two other chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat pediatric cancers: vinblastine and dacarbazine. Another chemotherapy drug also often used in children, methotrexate, has been in short supply since March, and is still hard to come by. All three drugs are used for a range of cancers but, in children, vinblastine and dacarbazine are most commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Methotrexate is the go-to drug for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common cancer in children.  The supply issues mean doctors must substitute the drugs with less effective alternatives or delay treatment until the drugs become available again. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Dr. Doug Hawkins, chair of the Children\u2019s Oncology Group, a national research organization. \u201cCan you imagine that your child has been diagnosed with cancer, and you\u2019re told, \u2018We know how to treat this, so we have a 70% chance, an 80% chance, a 90% chance of curing your child with standard treatment, and Oh, by the way, we can\u2019t get one of those standard treatments.\u2019\u201d The Biden administration announced this month that the supplies of carboplatin and cisplatin  have almost returned to pre-shortage levels, though the two drugs are still among the 15 listed as in shortage by the White House.  Dr. Eleonora Teplinsky, a breast and gynecologic medical oncologist, said at her hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey, that the supplies of carboplatin and cisplatin are \u201csignificantly better,\u201d if not fully resolved. However, in recent weeks, her colleagues who treat blood cancers have expressed deep concerns about the availability of vinblastine. Blood cancers include leukemia and lymphoma.  The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, a group that tracks drug shortages, said it started to notice supply issues for vinblastine and dacarbazine this month.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that they\u2019ve been able to fix individual shortages, but we\u2019re still not fixing the problem at large,\u201d Teplinsky, who heads the breast medical oncology team for Valley Health System, said of the federal government\u2019s response to the drug shortages.  In the absence of vinblastine, doctors in some cases may use a different drug, called vincristine, she said, but it can be less effective and comes with a different range of side effects. But in other cases, there are no alternatives. Vinblastine and dacarbazine are used in a four-drug combination treatment for older children with Hodgkin lymphoma. Without those drugs, Hawkins said, doctors have no other options. The Biden administration is also working to increase the supply of methotrexate, which has been in shortage since March. Dr. Tara Henderson, the chief of pediatric hematology and oncology at UChicago Medicine, said that after a short-lived improvement in the supply of methotrexate, the availability of the drug is becoming a problem again.  Methotrexate is a \u201cbackbone medication\u201d for leukemia which has a cure rate of more than 90%  when standard treatments are available, she said. \u201cWe are dealing with children with cancer with curable diseases, and we might not have the tools to cure them,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt seems like it should be a national priority,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to have all hands on deck figuring out these issues.\u201d Dr. Anders Kolb, president and CEO of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, said the shortages have forced hospitals to reconfigure how they stock their pharmacies, including buying in bulk and making sure they have other treatment options on hand. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to stay three steps ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like if you run out of something, just plug it into Amazon and it shows up the next day.\u201d \u201cThe supply chain is broken,\u201d said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer and executive vice president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The group has been pushing for the Food and Drug Administration and the White House, among others, to implement an early warning system for drug shortages. This system would also offer insights into the reasons why drugs are experiencing shortages. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a good understanding right now of the background of them and what puts them at risk,\u201d Gralow said. Drug shortages are not new. \u201cThis has been going on for decades,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThey\u2019re just getting more common, more pervasive and longer in duration.\u201d The shortages, he said, not only leave doctors feeling helpless, but also amplifies the sense of helplessness experienced by families and children. \u201cWe hope that it will not have a major impact on survival, but it\u2019s not going to increase survival,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cAnd so I think from the families\u2019 perspective, that\u2019s just devastating.\u201d Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Free at-home Covid tests can now be ordered: When to test and what the results mean",
        "content": "At-home Covid tests can be ordered for free starting Monday. Households can now order four free tests for home delivery at COVIDTests.gov. According to the government website, orders will begin shipping the week of Oct. 2. When the new tests arrive, however, people are advised to check the expiration dates on the boxes. Some tests may show expired dates, but the Food and Drug Administration has extended those dates, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The mailed tests will include instructions on how to look up the extended expiration dates.  With Covid on the rise again, you may find that you or a family member needs an at-home test for the first time in months.  Here\u2019s a refresher on how and when to test for Covid, and what your at-home results really mean.  The short answer is yes. The at-home Covid tests on the market should pick up all the variants in circulation, including EG.5, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86, said Dr. Michael Mina, a Covid testing expert and former professor of epidemiology, and immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually never seen a deterioration in accuracy of the tests, given any new variants,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because the mutations are happening in a different part of the virus than the portion detected by rapid tests.  \u201cAlmost every rapid test that\u2019s authorized in the U.S. and globally detects a protein called the nucleocapsid, which is stable and just doesn\u2019t, hasn\u2019t seen a lot of mutations,\u201d Mina said. The changes that lead to new variants tend to occur in the spike protein. If you get a positive result on a rapid test, it\u2019s most likely that you are contagious and can spread the virus.  \u201cIf you have enough virus to turn a rapid antigen test positive, you have a lot of virus there,\u201d Mina said. If the test results show up very quickly and the line is very dark, it could indicate you have a great chance of transmitting the virus to others, he added.  \u201cYou should really assume that you are highly infectious and do everything you can under the sun to not infect other people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve gone from having a really dark line to a much fainter line, then you should know that you\u2019re likely still able to transmit the virus, but the potential for that transmission is less.\u201d There are \u201cextremely rare circumstances\u201d when there are false positives, but the research indicates that a positive test result means you are most likely to be infectious, said Nam Tran, a professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees Covid testing efforts at UC Davis Health in California.  \u201cSo I would be cautious if you\u2019re positive, keep the mask on, and avoid contact as we have in the past,\u201d he said. If you were exposed to someone with Covid, Mina said, you are unlikely to test positive in the first day or so. He recommends testing at two to three days after exposure, and if you\u2019re negative, test again the next day.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends testing at day five after exposure, and he said that some people won\u2019t test positive until days six or seven \u2014 and that\u2019s within the range of what\u2019s normal. \u201cBut I would say the best rule of thumb is to start testing three days after exposure, and if you\u2019re negative, test again on day four or five,\u201d Mina said.  If you test negative, many of the same recommendations still hold \u2014 you may need to do repeat testing to ensure that the result is accurate.  \u201cYou may have tested too early, and the virus still hasn\u2019t replicated enough yet,\u201d Tran said.  If you are taking a rapid test at home to see if you have Covid, \u201cit\u2019s usually recommended to test over a few days, once a day, for a couple of days,\u201d he said.  A PCR test at a doctor\u2019s office or laboratory has a better chance of picking up low concentrations of the virus, so a negative PCR test might be more reliable. \u201cBut again, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect test,\u201d Tran said. \u201cSo if you still suspect then you might want to check it again. It\u2019s better safe than sorry, right?\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling symptomatic, and you think you were exposed, then I would say test again 12 to 24 hours later,\u201d Mina said. It\u2019s also important to collect the sample correctly, so Tran recommends that you follow the package directions on at-home tests carefully to get the most accurate results. Both tests are good. Tran said home tests had a bit of a bad reputation in 2020 but have become the go-to method for most people when it comes to diagnosing Covid.  At-home tests tend to be less expensive, faster and easy to use, Tran said, although PCR tests are more sensitive and can still detect lower levels of the virus. Most at-home tests are antigen tests, although a handful of pricier over-the-counter tests are molecular tests, which are more sensitive in a similar way to PCR. \u201cThey may not be 100% comparable to the PCR tests run by hospital labs, but they\u2019re nice to have, but expensive,\u201d he said. Mina doesn\u2019t see a huge advantage in PCR tests, although doctors might want to still use them. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I personally got a PCR test,\u201d he said.\u201d Instead, I just opt for saying, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to have a few rapid tests lying around my house for when I need them.\u2019\u201d It depends. In general, experts recommend you don\u2019t use expired tests, but there are some caveats. Some manufacturers have submitted results to the FDA that show that their test kits are still accurate past the expiration date, and people can look up whether their tests are included. Mina said he also recommends looking at the manufacture date and said that rapid antigen tests may remain reliable up to two years after that date. \u201cGenerally they\u2019re all very, very similar, and they\u2019re not going to expire within two years of manufacturing,\u201d he said. However, if the control line included in the test doesn\u2019t show up or is very faint, it\u2019s not reliable and he recommends throwing the test out. Tran said it\u2019s not a good idea to use any expired test unless the FDA has confirmed that the results are accurate for that particular test. \u201cWe don\u2019t try to see an expired carton of milk and decide to drink it, right?\u201d  The compounds and chemicals in the test kits can degrade over time, he noted. \u201cI know it costs money and I know it saves time, but if you\u2019re going to get a wrong result that could lead to unintended consequences,\u201d he said. Although some things have changed since the beginning of the pandemic, if you\u2019ve tested positive and you\u2019re currently positive, you should isolate. According to the CDC, a person should isolate for five days after testing positive, and then wear a mask for another five days or until you have two negative tests 48 hours apart.  Mina said it\u2019s OK to use antigen tests to make informed decisions based on your family and the health of the people around you.  \u201cIf you\u2019ve gone from a really dark line to a really faint or negative line in three days, you could probably exit isolation, because your immune system probably cleared the virus,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want to infect other people, but you also don\u2019t want to stay in isolation longer than you need to,\u201d Mina added. \u201cAnd so I think the best approach is to try to get your hands on some tests and use them judiciously.\u201d  If you have the sniffles, you may be tempted to assume it\u2019s \u201cjust a cold\u201d and not test for Covid at all. While more people have some immunity due to vaccination and previous exposure to the virus, experts say it\u2019s still a good idea to take a test.  \u201cDespite boosters and vaccines and treatment, transmission still exists and these viruses can break through previously acquired immunity,\u201d Mina said. \u201cTesting remains a mainstay of our collective efforts to limit our potential to infect others.\u201d People shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to test themselves if they think that they might be positive or if they\u2019re just visiting someone, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just good public health practice,\u201d he said.  And unlike in 2020, there are now more treatments for Covid.  The antiviral Paxlovid, for example, can be prescribed within five days of a person\u2019s symptoms starting. The drug has been shown to reduce a person\u2019s risk of hospitalization and is being studied to see whether it can reduce the risk of long Covid. A positive Covid test can help ensure you get the best care you can, Mina said.   CORRECTION (Sept. 26, 11:44 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated Nam Tran\u2019s title.

        "title": "Long Covid blood test offers first clues into what causes the mysterious condition",
        "content": "More than three years into the pandemic, the millions of people who have suffered from long Covid finally have scientific proof that their condition is real. Scientists have found clear differences in the blood of people with long Covid \u2014 a key first step in the development of a test to diagnose the illness. The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature, also offer clues into what could be causing the elusive condition that has perplexed doctors worldwide and left millions with ongoing fatigue, trouble with memory and other debilitating symptoms. The research is among the first to prove that \"long Covid is, in fact, a biological illness,\" said David Putrino, principal investigator of the new study and a professor of rehabilitation and human performance at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Dr. Marc Sala, co-director of the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive Covid-19 Center in Chicago, called the findings \"important.\" He was not involved with the new research. \"This will need to be investigated with more research, but at least it's something because, quite frankly, right now we don't have any blood tests\" either to diagnose long Covid or help doctors understand why it's occurring, he said. Putrino and his colleagues compared blood samples of 268 people. Some had Covid but had fully recovered, some had never been infected, and the rest had ongoing symptoms of long Covid at least four months after their infection. Several differences in the blood of people with long Covid stood out from the other groups. The activity of immune system cells called T cells and B cells \u2014 which help fight off germs \u2014 was \"irregular\" in long Covid patients, Putrino said. One of the strongest findings, he said, was that long Covid patients tended to have significantly lower levels of a hormone called cortisol. A major function of the hormone is to make people feel alert and awake. Low cortisol could help explain why many people with long Covid experience profound fatigue, he said. \"It was one of the findings that most definitively separated the folks with long Covid from the people without long Covid,\" Putrino said. The finding likely signals that the brain is having trouble regulating hormones. The research team plans to dig deeper into the role cortisol may play in long Covid in future studies. Meanwhile, doctors do not recommend simply boosting a person's cortisol levels in an attempt to \"fix\" the problem. \"There is no evidence that replacing cortisol in someone with long Covid would be a safe or effective thing to do,\" Sala said. The study also found that dormant viruses, such as the one that causes mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr, come alive again in long Covid patients. It's unclear, however, whether those old viruses are causing symptoms or flagging a problem within the immune system. \"We were looking for signals, and we found them,\" said Akiko Iwasaki, one of the researchers and a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the Yale School of Medicine. \"Now what we need to do is home in on each of these signals and understand better how the disease has been driven by these signals.\" The investigators did not find significant evidence that long Covid is the result of an autoimmune disorder, in which the body attacks itself. Dr. Clinton Wright, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke's division of clinical research, said additional studies will be necessary to find other ways Covid may lead to long-term symptoms. One theory is that the virus is hiding in brain tissue or other organs. \"We're really interested in whether the virus still exists in reservoirs in the body,\" he said. \"It's really hard to do that by measuring blood.\" He was not involved with the new study. Long Covid affects 1 in 13 U.S. adults, or 7.5%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings offer hope to patients like Joshua Roman, 39, of New York City, who participated in the study. \"We're in such a mysterious swamp of symptoms,\" he said. \"My long Covid treatment is just management of symptoms.\" Roman, a professional musician who plays the cello, takes daily medication to ease the lingering physical trembling that affects his ability to perform. \"It would be great if we could get to the thing that's causing me to shake in the first place, but we still don't know exactly what that is,\" he said.

        "title": "Many states are expanding their Medicaid programs to provide dental care to their poorest residents",
        "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 For months, Carlton Clemons endured crippling pain from a rotting wisdom tooth. He couldn\u2019t sleep, barely ate and relied on painkillers to get by. The 67-year-old from Nashville, Tennessee, could not afford to see a dentist on the $1,300-a-month his family gets in Social Security and disability payments. So he waited for the state to roll out a program this year that offers dental care to the more than 650,000 Medicaid recipients like him who are 21 and older. Tennessee is spending about $75 million annually on the program. \u201cMan, I thought I had made it to heaven because the pain was over,\u201d he said after the tooth was pulled in July at the Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry. \u201cWhen they did pull it out, I was so happy. I was so glad. Everything just changed after that.\u201d His wife, Cindy, who also is on Medicaid, has had her teeth pulled at the clinic. Medicaid, the federal and state health insurance program for the poor, requires states to provide dental coverage for children but not adults. But with a growing recognition of the economic and health costs of poor dental health and an influx of federal pandemic dollars, six states began or expanded their Medicaid programs this year to provide coverage for adults. Access remains difficult in many of those states with some dentists refusing to treat Medicaid patients. Even those who want to expand their practice are finding themselves caught up in red tape. Dr. Victor Wu, the chief medical officer for Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program, said he was pleased with the rollout of Medicaid dental benefits that started in January, but he acknowledges the state needs to build out its network and increase the participation rate among dentists. While dental care often is seen as routine, the poor often go without any care for years or even decades. Doing so has significant costs, both to taxpayers and to those who cannot afford treatment. One study from Texas A&M University found that treatment for preventable dental conditions represents up to 2.5% of emergency room visits, at a cost of $2 billion a year. An additional $45 billion is lost year in productivity in the United States annually from untreated oral disease, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cYou put off care and you get sicker and then it becomes a crisis where you\u2019re missing work or you end up going to the emergency department where you get a big bill and you don\u2019t get the tooth actually taken care of,\u201d said Dr. Rhonda Switzer-Nadasdi, the chief executive officer of Interfaith Dental Clinic which has offices in Nashville and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. \u201cYou need good teeth to have good employment,\u201d Switzer-Nadasdi said. All states provide some Medicaid dental benefits for adults, but some limit it to only specific segments of the population, like pregnant women or those who have intellectual disabilities, or cover only emergency care, according to CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded dental care. Hawaii, Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan, Maryland and New Hampshire were the latest to begin or expand their dental coverage; they did so this year. In New Hampshire, the state is spending $33.4 million over 12 months to provide dental care to its 88,000 Medicaid recipients. \u201cThere is an increasing understanding that oral health is inseparable from health care,\u201d said New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Joe Schapiro, who was the prime sponsor of the expanded dental benefits bill. \u201cThe amount of money spent on other health care problems that are related to oral health and the amount of money spent on emergency care when people can\u2019t get any kind of preventive or restorative care is not only unfortunate for those people\u2019s health but cost a tremendous amount of money.\u201d In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear pressed ahead with emergency regulations ensuring that about 900,000 Kentuckians would continue having access to dental care after the Republican-led legislature rejected his proposal. \u201cWe are focused on removing roadblocks that prevent people from getting back into the workforce, and this program does just that,\u201d he said. Virginia expanded its Medicaid program in 2021, budgeting $282 million for the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years to cover dental procedures for more than a million recipients. Last year, Kansas gave dental access to nearly 137,000 Medicaid recipients at a cost of $3.5 million in 2022 and $1.2 million in 2023. While advocates are welcoming these changes, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Utah and Louisiana still only offer limited benefits. Even as states add dental coverage, millions of beneficiaries are being culled from the Medicaid program nationwide as part of a review of eligibility, something states were prohibited from doing during the pandemic. There are also plenty of hiccups in states that have expanded care, including Tennessee. Among the biggest is that too few dentists, especially in rural areas, are taking Medicaid patients, resulting in long waiting times and hours-long drives in search of care. Only about 15% of dentist take Medicaid in New Hampshire, 24% in Tennessee and 27% in Virginia. Many dentists and groups advocating for expanded care blame Medicaid reimbursement rates. New Jersey only covers 13.3% of what a dentists normally charge, Michigan covers 17% and Rhode Island 22.4%, according to 2022 data analyzed by the American Dental Association. Illinois, New York, Ohio and Oregon each cover a little more than 28%. Most states, though, cover between 30% and 50% with Alaska and North Dakota covering at least 55% and Delaware, 76.9%. Dr. Heather Taylor, an assistant professor at the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University, said some of Indiana\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates for dental have not increased since 1998. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re incentivizing our dentists not to treat the ones that are in need, because we don\u2019t pay them even half of what they could get from private insurers,\u201d she said. Tennessee Family Dental, which has four clinics in the state, has experienced overwhelming demand from Medicaid patients. Dr. Ryan O\u2019Neill, a dentist who owns the business, said he got some 300 calls on the first day and that some of his patients have traveled from 30 minutes away or more. He wants to hire more dentists but said it can take upward of four months to get one certified under Medicaid. He also is struggling with a Medicaid billing system that routinely rejects some claims and he said there is \u201ca lot of inconsistency over what is approved and what is denied.\u201d \u201cOffices are hesitant to go in network because there\u2019s a lot of unknowns,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning what the rules are and, you know, trial and error in terms of how we\u2019re supposed to deal with a particular situation.\u201d Danielle Wilkes, a 26-year-old mother of five from Ashland, Tennessee, drove 90 minutes to see O\u2019Neill after calling dozens of dentists in her area and finding none who takes Medicaid. Her cousin, June Renee Pentecost, also came with her for treatment. For the past five years, Wilkes had been waiting to see a dentist after getting several teeth knocked out in a car wreck. She was told it would cost her thousands of dollars for multiple crowns, which she could not afford. \u201cI was mad at first but I was like there nothing she could do. I\u2019m just going to have to wait until my kids are grown up,\u201d she said, adding that the pain often brought her to tears. But here she was in a dental chair, her pink hair standing out against O\u2019Neill and dental assistant Jasmine Webb in black scrubs. Afterward, the soft-spoken Wilkes said she was \u201cjust happy\u201d to finally get the work done, even if she had to pay $400 that Medicaid did not cover. In a different room, Pentecost was getting examined for a root canal. It had been more than a decade since she last saw a dentist because she was deterred by the cost despite years of pain. A mother of five, she figured dental care would take away from spending on her children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t play with my kids because my head was hurting,\u201d she said. The 30-year-old was relieved to get the work done but wondered why the state had not offered the benefit sooner. \u201cI\u2019m hoping my pain would ease up and quit once I get my teeth fixed and then I won\u2019t have so many headaches and feel so bad,\u201d she said.

        "title": "As Covid cases rise, what to know about Paxlovid",
        "content": "Covid cases and hospitalizations have risen again. Some Americans are anxious about possibly getting very sick from the infection. Paxlovid antiviral pills remain an option for mitigating the risk. But what do we know about how well the treatment works, and who stands to benefit? Paxlovid lowers the amount of virus in the body. Research has shown that it is associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization or death \u2014 but only for those who are already at higher risk of severe illness from Covid because they are older or have underlying health conditions. Plus, there are potential downsides: Paxlovid can clash with many medications and it can cause some side effects, including a particularly weird one.  If you are thinking about taking Paxlovid, here are things to consider: The prescription medication must be started within five days of the onset of Covid symptoms. By lowering the amount of coronavirus in the blood early in the course of infection, it is meant to keep symptoms from getting worse. Three pills are taken twice a day for five days. The doses include: \u201cAnyone who is high risk for developing complications should consider taking Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Sarju Ganatra, a cardiologist at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts. \u201cThat is what is consistent with clinical trials and all the other studies as well.\u201d The strongest evidence backing Paxlovid\u2019s effectiveness concerns an increasingly small group: unvaccinated adults at high risk of progressing to severe Covid. This includes people who are age 60 or older or have health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes or obesity.  A 2022 trial found that among these higher-risk adults, Paxlovid significantly lowered their rate of hospitalization or death by nearly 90%.  A new study from researchers at the Cleveland Clinic looked at high-risk people who took Paxlovid between April 2022 and February 2023. The research, published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, found that the antiviral was associated with a 37% lower likelihood of hospitalization or death within 90 days and an 84% lower chance when looking only at death within 90 days.  It\u2019s unclear what, if any, substantial benefit Paxlovid has for people who aren\u2019t at substantial risk of getting very sick from Covid. Retired Toronto residents Bruce Woodrow, 71, and Marianne Moershel, 76, are at higher risk of Covid hospitalization because of their age. But they\u2019re both vaccinated and don\u2019t have any high-risk medical conditions. When the married couple tested positive one day after the other in the spring of 2022, Woodrow took Paxlovid, but Moershel decided she didn\u2019t feel well enough to go to the doctor for a prescription. \u201cHer symptoms and my symptoms, other than being a day apart, pretty much ran the same course,\u201d said Woodrow. \u201cNeither one of us can look back and say that I had any obvious benefit from taking it, but no downside.\u201d A spring 2022 study of veterans with at least one risk factor for severe Covid found that three months after taking Paxlovid, they had a 26% lower rate of various symptoms that are considered signs of long Covid compared with untreated vets. According to the study, which was published in March 2023, for every 1,000 people treated with Paxlovid, there were 23 fewer who had evidence of long Covid. The treatment was tied to a lower risk of these long-term symptoms, regardless of whether the vets were vaccinated or had had Covid before.  Dr. Lao-Tzu Allan-Blitz, a resident internist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to be done\u201d regarding long Covid prevention. The condition remains \u201can enigma,\u201d he said. Michael Vagnini is a 38-year-old chemist living in Midland, Michigan. He\u2019s vaccinated against Covid, healthy and physically active, with a particular zeal for rock climbing. A number of Vagnini\u2019s friends have suffered from ongoing symptoms after Covid infection. So he took Paxlovid when he got Covid in November 2022, hoping the treatment might protect him from long Covid.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t super concerned about severe disease,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cBut I was concerned about a long recovery or lingering symptoms.\u201d After grappling with fatigue and an occasional racing heart beat for a couple of months, he recovered fully.  Woodrow wonders if his decision to take Paxlovid might still be benefiting his health. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that had I not taken it, maybe I would have some long Covid issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way of knowing that.\u201d Researchers, meanwhile, are conducting studies of Paxlovid in children and immunocompromised people, and in those who follow the regimen for up to 25 days as a treatment for long Covid. Most notably, Paxlovid can produce a rather strange, bitter, metallic taste in the mouth. It can also cause diarrhea. The metallic taste goes away after finishing the five-day regimen. After taking three courses of Paxlovid \u2014 twice while receiving platinum-based chemotherapy for cancer, which is itself notorious for producing a dreadful metallic taste in the mouth \u2014 this reporter found the best way to mitigate the gross taste was to suck on sour candies, especially Green Apple Blow Pops. Peppermint tea also helps. The drug ritonavir, included in Paxlovid, can affect not just the nirmatrelvir component but also the drug levels of many other medications. This includes some statins, blood thinners, immunosuppressants and antidepressants. It\u2019s very important that people who are considering taking Paxlovid alert both their doctor and pharmacist to all the other medications and supplements they are taking. It might be possible to adjust the dose of a medication or temporarily stop taking it to allow the safe use of Paxlovid. Peter Anderson, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, noted that since Paxlovid was approved, experts have developed a revised list of notable drugs that may clash with ritonavir and published it on the National Institutes of Health website. Paxlovid is not recommended for people with severe kidney disease. Caution is advised for people with liver disease or abnormal liver enzyme levels. The prescribing doctor may ask to see results of routine blood tests in your recent medical records to determine if you have any kidney or liver health issues. The fast-mutating coronavirus doesn\u2019t seem to have reduced Paxlovid\u2019s effectiveness. Nevertheless, Dr. Jeremy Faust, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, warned that doctors should still avoid overprescribing a treatment that only offers a clear, substantial benefit to a small segment of the population. \u201cAnytime you have a treatment that has no benefit or very, very low benefit, all that remains are risks, known and unknown,\u201d Faust said. He said that whenever doctors prescribe an antibiotic or an antiviral like Paxlovid, there\u2019s always the chance of prompting the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the infection. Covid symptoms are known to sometimes rebound a number of days after people finish taking Paxlovid. Researchers have found that the Covid rebound rate is comparable in people who took Paxlovid and those who didn\u2019t. It could be that people who take Paxlovid are more likely to report rebounding symptoms, giving the impression that it\u2019s more common among them. The good news is that Covid rebounds typically resolve themselves well on their own and aren\u2019t apparently tied to a higher risk of severe illness. Out of a stockpile of 24 million Paxlovid treatment packs the federal government purchased to distribute for free, there are still about 8 million courses left.  Once that supply runs out, insurers will determine coverage and may require that people pay out-of-pocket costs. They also might require doctors to submit prior authorization requests for prescriptions for certain patients or deny some people coverage outright.  Medicaid must cover Paxlovid through September 2024. People with Medicare, including Medicare Advantage plans, should expect coverage of the treatment but may be subjected to cost sharing.

        "title": "Girl from Netflix's 'Taking Care of Maya' was 'imprisoned and battered' before mother's suicide, lawyer says",
        "content": "A hospital \"falsely imprisoned and battered\" a girl and wrongly accused her parents of child abuse, leading the mother's suicide, jurors were told in opening statements Thursday in a case that gained notoriety from a Netflix documentary. Loved ones of the late Beata Kowalski filed a $200 million lawsuit against Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, claiming the medical center's negligence ended in the mother's untimely death. Jack and Beata Kowalski's daughter, Maya, now 17, suffered from severe pains that the family was told were due to a rare neurological condition, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Those with the condition can experience intense pain with the the most moderate contact. When Maya was taken to the hospital, the lawsuit said, doctors suspected the parents of child abuse and that the mother, Beata, was suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy. It's a condition when someone, often an adult, falsifies another's symptoms, often in a child, sometimes to seek attention. Maya was separated from her family for months due to doctors wrongly accusing the parents of abuse and refusing to believe the girl suffered from CRPS, the lawsuit said. \u201cI was medically kidnapped,\u201d Maya told People Magazine in an exclusive interview in June. The separation ultimately culminated in Beata Kowalski\u2019s suicide in early 2017, according to plaintiff's attorney Greg Anderson. The family's saga was profiled in the Netflix documentary \"Take Care of Maya.\" Maya was released back to the care of her family a week after Beata Kowalski\u2019s suicide, the lawsuit said. \"Maya Kowalski was falsely imprisoned and battered. She was denied communication with her family,\" Anderson told jurors. \"She was denied communication with the outside. She was told that her mother was crazy. She was told by social workers, one in particular, that she would be her mother.\" The family says Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital doctors should have known that Maya suffered from CRPS, but they still touched and hugged the girl, causing pain in an effort to disprove the diagnosis. \"Maya was repeatedly battered by nurses and social workers trying to prove that she did not have CRPS,\" Anderson added. Maya Kowalski dabbed away tears during portions of Thursday's opening statements. \"They [defendants] continued to accuse the Kowalskis, Jack and Beata, of being child abusers even after the evidence ... was overwhelming that she [Maya] had CRPS,\" Anderson said. The hospital's attorney, Howard Hunter, said doctors did their best to treat a difficult case in which a child appeared to be in extreme pain and her leg muscles atrophied after a months in a wheelchair. \"She was demanding pain medication, pain medication in large quantities,\" Hunter told the court. \"Mrs. Kowalski arrived a while later and you're going to hear when she arrived she forbade the doctors and the nurses to touch Maya. The doctors and nurses wanted to assess her, to examine her.\" Doctors in the ER wanted to check off any number of possible reasons for Maya's extreme mid-section pain but the mother allegedly told them not to touch her daughter before giving her high doses of painkillers, the defense said. \"Mrs. Kowalsku insisted that before there be any work up of the child she wanted ketamine, and not just any amount of ketamine,\" Hunter said. \"It is not approved for use in children, nor is it approved for use in high doses for treatment in CRPS.\" The mother allegedly demanded 1,500 mg of Ketamine for Maya. \"That is a big dose,\" Hunter said. \"That dose you're going to hear is several times, many times the maximum dose [for children].\" If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

        "title": "CDC recommends RSV vaccine given during pregnancy to protect babies",
        "content": "Pregnant people should get an RSV vaccine at 32 to 36 weeks\u2019 gestation in order to protect their newborns from RSV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. An advisory committee to the agency voted 11-1 to recommend the injection. Soon after, CDC Director Mandy Cohen formally endorsed that recommendation, the final step that allows the vaccine to be distributed to the public. The single-dose shot, made by Pfizer, is called Abrysvo and already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It spurs the production of antibodies in the mother that transfer through the placenta. The vaccine is the first approved that can protect babies from RSV.  That protection lasts through their first six months, clinical trial data showed. When given at 32 to 36 weeks\u2019 gestation, Abrysvo was found to lower the risk of severe disease from RSV among infants by 91% within roughly three months after birth. By around six months, the efficacy was just under 77%. RSV is typically mild in young, healthy adults, but it poses a bigger threat to children younger than 5. The virus causes up to 80,000 hospitalizations and up to 300 deaths annually among that age group in the United States. Almost 80% of children hospitalized with RSV under age 2 have no underlying medical conditions.  Last year, a dramatic spike in severe RSV infections overwhelmed children\u2019s hospitals.  RSV is also common \u2014 most children are infected in the first year of life, and almost all by age 2.  Pregnant people should get the new vaccine from September through January, when RSV rates are highest nationally, the CDC said.  Cases of RSV are already rising, with the number of positive tests higher now than in mid-August, according to CDC data. Another new form of RSV protection for babies was also approved this summer: an injectable drug that delivers a dose of antibodies directly to an infant\u2019s bloodstream. The CDC recommended that shot, called Beyfortus, for all babies up to 8 months old who are born during or entering their first RSV season, as well as for infants 8 to 19 months old who are at increased risk of severe disease and entering their second season.  The CDC advisory committee said Friday that either shot can be used to protect infants, and most babies won\u2019t need both.  The benefits of the vaccine are that it protects babies immediately after birth and doesn\u2019t require them to get a shot. However, the antibody injection doesn\u2019t pose a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and some evidence suggests its protection wanes more slowly.  The CDC advisers also noted that the availability of Beyfortus may be limited during the current RSV season. Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, the lone CDC advisory group member who voted against Abrysvo, expressed concern that the recommendation was too complicated. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to make providing care more difficult,\u201d said Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cIf we just say the child should get the monoclonal [antibody drug], we have a very simple recommendation. It\u2019s a cost effective and very effective mechanism of protecting the child.\u201d But other members said it was important to have more than one protective tool. \u201cI could not have imagined better options for our infants and children. This is what we\u2019ve been striving for. As a neonatologist with high-risk babies, this is just fantastic,\u201d said Dr. Pablo S\u00e1nchez, a pediatrics professor at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. The most common side effects reported among pregnant women in Pfizer\u2019s trial were fatigue, headache, injection site pain, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain and diarrhea. There was also a slightly higher rate of preterm births (defined as before 37 weeks\u2019 gestation) among women who got the vaccine than those who got a placebo. The difference wasn\u2019t statistically significant, but the prescribing label for Abrysvo comes with a warning not to administer it before 32 weeks\u2019 gestation nonetheless.  Last year, the pharmaceutical company GSK halted its trial of an RSV vaccine after it showed a higher preterm birth rate among some recipients. The CDC advisers said Friday that those results were relevant to the evaluation of Pfizer\u2019s shot.  Pfizer\u2019s trial also found a slightly higher number of hypertensive disorders like pre-eclampsia among the vaccine group. Pfizer has said it will monitor the risk of preterm birth and hypertensive disorders among vaccine recipients.  Due to a lack of data, the CDC committee said it\u2019s too soon to know whether additional RSV vaccine doses should be given in subsequent pregnancies. Abrysvo is expected to be listed at $295, but the price for individual consumers will depend on their insurance plans. The shot will be covered under the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program, which makes some vaccines and immunizations free to children who are uninsured, underinsured, Medicare-eligible, or Native American or Alaska Natives. Meanwhile, two new RSV vaccines are already available at pharmacies for adults ages 60 and older \u2014 a group also vulnerable to severe illness. One of those shots, from Pfizer, is the same formulation as the new shot for use during pregnancy. Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Some providers are dropping gender-affirming care for kids even in cases where it\u2019s legal",
        "content": "ST. LOUIS \u2014 As Republican-led states have rushed to ban gender-affirming care for minors, some families with transgender children found a bit of solace: At least they lived in states that would allow those already receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy to continue. But in some places, including Missouri and North Dakota, the care has abruptly been halted because medical providers are wary of harsh liability provisions in those same laws \u2014 one of multiple reasons that advocates say care has become harder to access even where it remains legal. \u201cIt was a completely crushing blow,\u201d said Becky Hormuth, whose 16-year-old son was receiving treatment from the Washington University Gender Center at St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital until it stopped the care for minors this month. Hormuth cried. Her son cried, too. \u201cThere was some anger there, not towards the doctors, not toward Wash U. Our anger is towards the politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see our children. They say the health care is harmful. They don\u2019t know how much it helps my child.\u201d Since last year, conservative lawmakers and governors have prioritized restricting access to transgender care under the name of protecting children. At least 22 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Most of the bans face legal challenges and enforcement on some of them has been put on hold by courts. All the laws ban gender-affirming surgery for minors, although it is rare, with fewer than 3,700 performed in the U.S. on patients ages 12 to 18 from 2016 through 2019, according to a study published last month. It\u2019s not clear how many of those patients were 18 when they received the surgeries. There\u2019s more variation, though, in how states handle puberty-blockers and hormone treatments under the new bans. Georgia\u2019s law does not ban those for minors. The others do. But some states, including North Carolina and Utah, allow young people taking them already to continue. Others require the treatments to be phased out over time. These treatments are accepted by major medical groups as evidence-based care that transgender people should be able to access. James Thurow said the treatment at the Washington University center changed everything for his stepson, a 17-year-old junior at a suburban St. Louis high school who is earning As and Bs instead of his past Cs, has a girlfriend and a close group of friends. \u201cHis depression, his anxiety had pretty much dissipated because he was receiving the gender-affirming care,\u201d Thurow said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing the best he\u2019s ever done at school. His teachers were blown away at how quickly his grades shot up.\u201d For its part, the center said in a statement that it was \u201cdisheartened\u201d to have to stop the care. Its decision followed a similar one from University of Missouri Health Care, where the treatment for minors stopped Aug. 28, the same day the law took effect. Both blamed a section of the law that increased the liability for providers. Under it, patients can sue for injury from the treatment until they turn 36, or even longer if the harm continues past then. The law gives the health care provider the burden of proving that the harm was not the result of hormones or puberty-blocking drugs. And the minimum damages awarded in such cases would be $500,000. Neither state Sen. Mike Moon, the Republican who was the prime sponsor of the Missouri ban, state Sen. Justin Brown nor state Rep. Dale Wright, whose committees advanced the measure, responded immediately to questions left Thursday by voicemail, email or phone message about the law\u2019s intent. In North Dakota, the law allows treatment to continue for minors who were receiving care before the law took effect in April. But it does not allow a doctor to switch the patient to a different gender dysphoria-related medication. And it allows patients to sue over injuries from treatment until they turn 48. Providers there have simply stopped gender-affirming care, said Brittany Stewart, a lawyer at Gender Justice, which is suing over the ban in the state. \u201cTo protect themselves from criminal liability, they\u2019ve just decided to not even risk it because that vague law doesn\u2019t give them enough detail to understand exactly what they can and cannot do,\u201d Stewart said. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, said it\u2019s not just liability clauses that have caused providers to stop treatment. Across the South, where most states have adopted bans on gender-affirming care for minors, she said she\u2019s heard of psychologists who wrongly believe the ban applies to them and pharmacists who stop filling orders for hormones for minors, even in places where the laws are on hold because of court orders. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the level of kind of chaos and stress and confusion it\u2019s causing on the ground,\u201d she said, \u201cparticularly ... for people who live in more rural communities or places where even before a law went into effect, it still took quite a bit of effort to get this care.\u201d Her organization is providing grants and navigation services to help children get treatment in states where it\u2019s legal and available. That system is similar to networks that are helping women in states where abortion is not banned get care. But there\u2019s one key difference: gender-affirming care is ongoing. For 12-year-old Tate Dolney in Fargo, North Dakota, continuing care means traveling to neighboring Minnesota for medical appointments. \u201cIt\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair,\u201d his mother, Devon Dolney, said at a news conference this month, \u201cthat our own state government is making us feel like we have to choose between the health and well-being of our child and our home.\u201d Hormuth\u2019s son is on the waiting list for a clinic in Chicago, at least a five-hour drive away, but is looking at other options, too. Hormuth, a teacher, has asked also her principal to write a recommendation in case the family decides to move to another state. \u201cShould we have to leave?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo one should have to have a plan to move out of state just because their kid needs to get the health care they need.\u201d In the meantime, the family did what many have: saving leftover testosterone from vials. They have enough doses stockpiled to last a year.   ",

        "title": "FTC sues private-equity backed anesthesia staffing company, saying it tried to monopolize the market and drive up prices",
        "content": "The Federal Trade Commission sued U.S. Anesthesia Partners Inc., one of the country\u2019s top anesthesia staffing companies, and its private-equity backer, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, on Thursday, accusing both entities of scheming over a decade to acquire anesthesia practices in Texas, monopolize the market, drive up prices for patients and generate profits. \u201cThanks to its anticompetitive conduct, USAP has been able to extract monopoly profits while simultaneously growing its monopoly power,\u201d the FTC said in its civil complaint, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Texas in Houston. \u201cThis conduct has resulted in egregious price increases for patients and their employers, on the order of tens of millions of dollars or more each year.\u201d The FTC\u2019s suit follows recent comments by Lina Khan, the commission\u2019s chairwoman, that her agency would investigate anticompetitive practices among companies acquired by private-equity firms. Private-equity firms use borrowed money to buy companies they hope to sell at profits in five to seven years. The FTC oversees mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they do not result in monopolies, but it typically focuses on buyouts that meet a large-dollar threshold \u2014 more than $100 million \u2014 though it can review smaller deals, as well. Companies purchased by private-equity firms generally fall under the threshold and so have escaped scrutiny. Now, however, the FTC\u2019s suit indicates the government believes even smaller buyouts, such as a roll-up of physician practices in a city, a state or a region, can give companies monopoly power, allowing them to raise prices for goods and services without fear of competitors\u2019 undercutting them. In recent years, sophisticated private-equity investors have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into the health care industry, buying up nursing homes and hospice operations, hospital staffing companies and an array of doctors\u2019 practices. The private-equity firms provide financing and management expertise to the companies they acquire but operate in the background; only rarely has the government sued the firms when companies they own are accused of improprieties, such as Medicare fraud or anti-competitive behavior. U.S. Anesthesia Partners has 4,500 clinicians serving 2 million patients in nine states, including Colorado, Florida, Kansas and Tennessee. A spokesman for the company called the FTC\u2019s allegations \u201cmisguided\u201d in a news release. The release quotes Dr. Derek Schoppa, a practicing USAP physician in Texas and a USAP board member: \u201cThe FTC\u2019s intended outcome threatens to disrupt and restrict patients\u2019 equitable access to quality anesthesia care in Texas and will negatively impact the Texas hospitals and health systems that provide care in underserved communities.\u201d A Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe spokeswoman said in a statement that the firm was confident it would prevail in the FTC\u2019s case, which it called meritless and unprecedented. \u201cWe are proud of our investment in USAP, which has allowed independent anesthesiologists to deliver superior clinical outcomes to underserved populations,\u201d the statement said.  Founded in 1979 and based in New York and San Francisco, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe is one of the country\u2019s oldest private-equity firms. It invests primarily in health care and technology companies and has $31 billion in capital. Anesthesiology practices have been focuses of many private-equity firms in recent years. A February 2020 study of private-equity buyouts of physician practices in the Journal of the American Medical Association Forum found that anesthesiology practices accounted for almost 20% of those buyouts, the highest percentage of deals involving a single specialty. Emergency medicine practices accounted for 12% of the takeovers. In addition to anesthesia services, private-equity firms have acquired dermatology, gastroenterology and ophthalmology practices. Independent academic research shows that after private-equity firms take over doctors\u2019 practices, patient costs rise. Research published in JAMA Forum a year ago found that private-equity-acquired physician practices charged on average 20% more per patient claim than the study\u2019s control group.  Anesthesia costs rose even more after a private-equity takeover, a February 2022 study published by the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine found. It analyzed more than 2 million anesthesia claims from 2012 through 2017 and found that patient costs rose 26% after anesthesiology practices were acquired. That aligns with one of the FTC\u2019s allegations in its complaint: USAP\u2019s reimbursement rates \u201care double the median rate of other anesthesia providers in Texas,\u201d it said. NBC News has reported on the negative impacts some other private-equity takeovers of anesthesiology practices have had on hospitals. Last fall, for example, officials at several hospitals contended that the contracts they had with private equity-owned anesthesia staffing companies had led to dangerous understaffing at their facilities. Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, a level 2 trauma center, broke its contract with a private-equity-owned anesthesia staffing company last year, saying it had severely understaffed the facility and put patients at risk. At the time, the private-equity-owned staffing company in the Renown matter (not U.S. Anesthesia Partners) declined to comment on the criticism.

        "title": "GM union workers ratify UAW deal following contentious vote",
        "content": "DETROIT \u2014 General Motors union workers ratified a record deal with the United Auto Workers after a contentious final few days of voting, according to results posted Thursday morning by the union. Much like the negotiations themselves, voting was not as smooth as many thought it would be. A majority of the Detroit automaker\u2019s large assembly plants rejected the pact, however it wasn\u2019t enough to offset support at smaller facilities and a handful of other assembly plants. Ratification of the deal came under doubt Wednesday morning, after seven of GM\u2019s 11 U.S. assembly plants rejected the pact. But a swing in voting results in favor of the deal, specifically at a SUV plant in Texas, gave the agreement a much needed lifeline. According to the UAW\u2019s vote tracker, the deal was supported by 54.7% of the nearly 36,000 autoworkers at GM who voted. The vote total was 19,683 in support versus 16,275 against \u2014 a margin of 3,409 votes. Both the UAW and GM declined to comment on the results until they\u2019ve been finalized. Voting on similar contracts at Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis is ongoing, with support of roughly 67% of unionized workers at each automaker who voted as of Thursday morning, according to the union. Barring any major shifts or swing in turnouts, those deals are likely to pass. GM\u2019s voting was closer, in part, due to the demographics of the company\u2019s workforce. The automaker has the highest number of traditional workers on a percentage basis compared to its crosstown rivals. Such workers have voiced disapproval for the wage increases granted to them by the deals, compared to those offered to newer hires. They were also dissatisfied with pension contributions and retirement benefits. For the union and UAW President Shawn Fain, the deals represent significant economic gains. They include 25% pay increases; a path to secure future jobs for union ranks such as battery plants; and a springboard for organizing efforts at other non-union automakers operating in the U.S. \u2014 a main goal of Fain moving forward. For the companies as well as their investors, the contracts represent the top-end of forecasted increases in labor costs. While the automakers several times called foul on the union\u2019s tactics, including six weeks of targeted strikes, they should be able to stomach the cost increases. That\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t be seeking offsets to the increases elsewhere in the forms of future investments, restructuring and other means. Ford CFO John Lawler last month said the UAW deal, if ratified by members, would add $850 to $900 in costs per vehicle assembled. He said Ford will work to \u201cfind productivity and efficiencies and cost reductions throughout the company\u201d to offset the additional costs and deliver on previously announced profitability targets.

        "title": "Top Anheuser-Busch marketing executive is leaving after collapse in Bud Light sales",
        "content": "Beer giant Anheuser-Busch says its head of U.S. marketing is leaving, months after its Bud Light brand lost its position as the top beer brand in the country. The company said U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Benoit Garbe will leave at the end of 2023 \u201cin order to embark on a new chapter in his career,\u201d with U.S. Chief Commercial Officer Kyle Norrington taking charge of marketing activities. The company said other sales leaders will report directly to Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth. \u201cThese senior leadership changes will accelerate our return to growth as we continue to focus on what we do best \u2014 brewing great beer for everyone and earning our place in moments that matter,\u201d Whitworth said in an emailed statement. He also said the changes would reduce layers of management. Bud Light lost its U.S. leadership title to Modelo Especial over the summer. Sales of the brand have been falling for years while Modelo\u2019s parent, Constellation Brands, gained steam and marketed itself more successfully to younger beer drinkers. Bud Light was also the target of a sharp backlash after it partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in April for a sponsored Instagram post that ran the weekend of the NCAA basketball men\u2019s and women\u2019s national championships. Conservative politicians and influencers said they would boycott the brand in response and shared videos of themselves throwing the beer away, pouring it out, or shooting cans. Bud Light sales plunged. Experts said Modelo Especial would have become the top U.S. beer in the near future anyway, but the combination of the two brands\u2019 sales trajectories and the boycotts gave it the title sooner. The company tried to escape the controversy and win back people who were swearing off Bud Light. Whitworth said in a statement on April 14 that the company \u201cnever intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.\u201d Weeks later, the company put two top marketing executives on leave. Ahead of Memorial Day, it offered big rebates on Bud Light as well. The marketing shake-up continued in July as the company said it would lay off 350 employees, or around 2% of its U.S. staff. Meanwhile Mulvaney said Anheuser-Busch never reached out to her even as she dealt with personal fallout from the boycott. She added that the company\u2019s response \u201cgives customers permission to be as transphobic and hateful as they want.\u201d Shares of Anheuser-Busch\u2019s parent company, AB InBev, fell from about $66 to $45 at the height of the controversy. They have since recovered most of those losses and closed at about $61 on Wednesday. Over the last five years, though, AB InBev stock has fallen 22%, while Modelo parent Constellation Brands has risen 21%. Molson Coors is down about 8% over that time, and smaller competitor Boston Beer has gained 11%. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Mortgage rates are slipping after a rapid rise",
        "content": "Halloween is done, scary season is ending, and the horrors of the housing market are getting more gentle \u2014 if only a little bit. Mortgage rates are coming down slightly after a dramatic rise. The government-backed mortgage company Fannie Mae says the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was down to 6.73% on Thursday. It peaked at more than 8% in mid-October. Since rates have come down, demand for mortgages is starting to tick higher. It's a modest increase, as the Mortgage Bankers Association says demand in early November was 12% lower than the same time in 2022. Borrowing costs for mortgages are at two-decade highs, but prices have continued to rise because so few houses are on the market. That's put home ownership out of reach for large numbers of people. The situation has changed because investors are becoming convinced that the Federal Reserve might really be done raising rates. It has raised its benchmark interest rate from near-zero in early 2022 to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% by July, and mortgage rates, along with interest rates on auto loans, credit cards and other financial products, moved higher in tandem. The gap between typical interest rates and mortgage rates also got unusually large. While the Fed hasn't raised interest rates in more than three months, mortgage rates had continued to rise because investors thought the central bank was likely to keep raising them in the future. But there are signs inflation is continuing to fade, and that the Fed might be satisfied with the progress it's made in getting price gains under control. That's let mortgage rates stabilize and start to come down However, over the longer term, lower mortgage rates might not make houses more affordable, as home prices tend to rise when mortgage rates go down precisely because buyers have an easier time borrowing money.

        "title": "Prodded everywhere to tip, Americans often say no",
        "content": "\u201cAdd a tip?\u201d The prompts have become ubiquitous in all kinds of sales situations \u2014 from ordering a coffee to paying for a packaged sandwich \u2014 as digital card readers proliferate. But while automated requests for gratuities continue to spur confusion and grumbling, recent data suggests consumers have no trouble breezing past them. Many people first started noticing so-called tipflation as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Venturing out again to bars, restaurants and shops, consumers were confronted with what felt like a new set of etiquette expectations \u2014 and duly began tipping more often, even as many griped loudly about it. But those upticks were modest and far from universal, and some of shoppers\u2019 generosity now looks to be waning. In a survey released this month by the Pew Research Center, 72% of American adults said tipping is now expected in more places than it was five years ago \u2014 but that\u2019s pretty much all consumers can agree on when it comes to tipping. Many dislike it when the tablets they\u2019re presented suggest specific gratuity amounts; 40% oppose the prompts, while just 24% favor them, according to Pew. But when consumers are left to their own devices, they take widely different approaches to deciding how much extra to offer and when to offer it, if at all. While 78% of respondents told Pew they always or often tip for haircuts, just 61% said the same of tipping their taxi or ride-hailing drivers. And only 1 in 4 reported frequently tipping baristas. Americans can\u2019t even agree on whether adding a tip is more of a choice or an obligation: 21% see it the first way and 29% the latter, with the remaining 49% landing somewhere in the squishy middle, saying it depends on the situation. There\u2019s just too many prompts now in the marketplace with these automated payment systems. DEIDRE POPOVICH, TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY It\u2019s no surprise consumers are so divided and exasperated, said Deidre Popovich, a Texas Tech University professor of marketing and supply chain management who specializes in consumer behavior. \u201cI think there\u2019s just too many prompts now in the marketplace with these automated payment systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to tipping when we can evaluate the service, and in a lot of these situations, there\u2019s no service tied to the tip. What do we do?\u201d There has been some movement at the margins of Americans\u2019 gratuity habits. NBC News reported in February that tipping frequency was up, possibly reflecting a pandemic hangover of good vibes toward service workers when expanding point-of-sale systems made it easier for businesses to solicit tips. The payments processor Square, which makes a popular point-of-sale platform, said the restaurant and retail workers who use its software have seen increases in tipped and overtime earnings. But the company noted that the rises have tracked broader wage increases and higher restaurant menu prices. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely observed a slight increase in tipping over the last few years,\u201d said Ara Kharazian, the research lead at Square. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a lot more modest than people realize, and it\u2019s starting to slow down a lot.\u201d For example, the average overall earnings for restaurant workers using Square were $17.67 an hour in October, with a base wage of $13.80. That $3.87 difference, which mostly reflects tips, is only about 60 cents higher than it was in October 2021, according to the company\u2019s payroll index. As consumers get used to seeing tip prompts in more places more regularly, they may be getting more comfortable ignoring them \u2014 especially after having dealt with inflation-related sticker shock for many goods and services over the past year. We\u2019ve definitely observed a slight increase in tipping over the last few years, but I think it\u2019s a lot more modest than people realize. ARA KHARAZIAN, RESEARCH LEAD AT SQUARE Lightspeed, another POS provider, said customers add tips on just 1.3% of in-store transactions at the retailers that have enabled its tipping feature. While tip levels in some settings have held steady or inched higher, others are declining. Lightspeed said the median tip at all types of restaurants using its service increased from 16.9% in the second quarter last year to 17.3% in the same period this year. But tip amounts for online orders and delivery \u2014 for which patrons can decide privately whether to tip, without service workers nearby \u2014 have dipped since last year, from about 8.8% to 8.1%. Another point-of-sale platform, Toast, said in September that average tips at full-service restaurants declined from 19.7% in the first quarter this year to 19.4% in the second \u2014 the lowest level for that category since the start of the pandemic. Gratuities at quick-service restaurants using Toast barely ticked up to 16.1% from 16.0% over the same period. A Bankrate survey this year found tipping frequency has continued a multiyear downslide virtually across the board. The shares of Americans who say they always tip in service transactions from food delivery to hotel housekeeping have steadily shrunk. That\u2019s the case even at sit-down restaurants, where those who reported always tipping their servers fell from 75% in 2021 to 65% this spring. Some companies are trying other ways to nudge customers to tip. DoorDash wrote in a blog post this month that it was testing an in-app pop-up in the U.S. and Canada to remind users of its delivery service to leave gratuities, lest they risk longer waits. \u201cOrders with no tip might take longer to get delivered,\u201d the test prompt reads. \u201cAre you sure you want to continue?\u201d J.J.

        "title": "Starbucks workers file more labor complaints with NYC as union goes on largest-ever strike",
        "content": "Starbucks workers in New York City have filed 14 more complaints alleging that the coffee giant violated the city\u2019s labor laws. New York\u2019s Fair Workweek law says that employers have to give their workers regular schedules from week to week, 14 days notice of their scheduled hours and extra pay for shift changes, among other requirements. Starbucks baristas have repeatedly accused the company of running afoul of the law: They have filed nearly 70 complaints with the city related to the law since February. The allegations come as Starbucks baristas at more than 200 locations nationwide strike Thursday, on the company\u2019s busy Red Cup promotion day. To celebrate the holiday season, Starbucks every year gives away reusable red cups bearing the company\u2019s logo with any purchase. Starbucks Workers United said the strike is protesting understaffing at the company\u2019s locations, particularly on promotion days. Workers are also demanding that Starbucks turn off mobile ordering on future promotion days. Convenient mobile ordering has become important to Starbucks\u2019 business as customers increasingly prefer ordering from their phones instead of waiting in drive-thru lines or stores for their drinks. But mobile orders can overwhelm baristas quickly, especially on days when the company offers discounts or freebies. Mobile order and delivery accounted for a third of the company\u2019s sales in its latest quarter. Nearly two years after the union first won an election at a Starbucks store, more than 360 of Starbucks\u2019 roughly 9,000 company-owned locations have voted to unionize, according to National Labor Relations Board data. But no location has come close to a collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks yet. For its part, Starbucks has said it\u2019s working to improve workers\u2019 jobs by automating boring tasks and raising pay. The chain recently said it will bump employees\u2019 wages by at least 3% at the start of next year. \u201cWe are constantly striving to improve our partners\u2019 experience and make their jobs easier,\u201d Starbucks Chief Technology Officer Deborah Hall Lefevre said at the company\u2019s investor update in New York City on Nov. 2. Sara Kelly, the company\u2019s chief partner officer, said at the same event that Starbucks has made \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d in increasing scheduled hours, and will factor baristas\u2019 preferences into its scheduling software. Starbucks has previously run afoul of New York City. The city\u2019s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection sued the company in 2022 for firing a barista involved in union organizing, alleging that his dismissal violated the \u201cjust cause\u201d provision of the law. If workers\u2019 allegations are proven, Starbucks could face a big penalty. Last year, Chipotle paid $20 million to workers, and $1 million to the city, to settle Fair Workweek violations. \u201cNew York City passed the Fair Work Week law so workers like me would be able to sustain ourselves and our families,\u201d Alberto Oliart, a barista in Brooklyn, said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cBut Starbucks is blatantly ignoring the law, making it difficult for us to survive.\u201d ",

        "title": "Pandas may finally be returning to California as Xi-Biden summit yields unlikely diplomatic win",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pandas might soon be returning to California, Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested Wednesday at a dinner in San Francisco attended by hundreds of U.S. business leaders. The return to China this month of the three giant pandas at the National Zoo in Washington has raised concerns that the United States could soon have none of the beloved bears. Pandas, which are endemic to China, have been a symbol of U.S.-China friendship since Beijing sent the first two to Washington in 1972 in what is known as \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d \u201cI was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to see them off,\u201d Xi said. \u201cI also learned that the San Diego Zoo and the Californians very much look forward to welcoming pandas back.\u201d  Xi did not say how many pandas might be sent to the U.S. or when. The friendly gesture came after a day of talks between Xi and President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, aimed at easing fears that the world\u2019s two biggest economies could be headed toward conflict. The four-hour summit was the first time the two leaders had spoken in a year. They reached agreement on a number of issues such as the resumption of military-to-military communications and cooperation on counternarcotics, including curbing the flow from China of precursor chemicals and pill presses that contribute to the U.S. fentanyl crisis. Xi then attended a dinner for U.S. business leaders, hosted by the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, while Biden went to a dinner for APEC leaders. For Xi, the dinner was a chance to court American businesses as China grapples with an economic slowdown. U.S. executives, meanwhile, were seeking insight on how to do business in an environment they see as increasingly unpredictable. U.S. lawmakers and others had criticized those attending the dinner as ignoring China\u2019s human rights record. It is \u201cunconscionable that American companies might pay thousands of dollars\u201d to attend a dinner with Xi, said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, citing rights abuses in the Chinese region of Xinjiang that the U.S. government has said amount to genocide. China denies the allegations. Among the roughly 400 dinner guests were Apple CEO Tim Cook, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam. Organizers said Tesla CEO Elon Musk attended an earlier reception but was not present at the dinner. Addressing the room, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the vast majority of the U.S. trade and investment relationship with China is not affected by national security concerns and that the U.S. is committed to promoting reciprocal trade and investment in those areas. \u201cA growing China that plays by the rules is in all of our interests,\u201d she said.  Xi then spoke for more than 35 minutes, receiving a standing ovation before and after. In a world of challenges, he said, the U.S. and China \u201cmust handle our relations well.\u201d China is ready to be a partner of the United States, and the world needs that relationship, Xi said, adding there was \u201cplenty of room for our cooperation\u201d as he rejected the view that China is a threat.  \u201cWe should build more bridges and pave more roads for people-to-people interactions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must not erect barriers or create a chilling effect.\u201d Xi said pandas had long been \u201cenvoys of friendship\u201d between the American and Chinese people.  The departure of the National Zoo pandas left Zoo Atlanta\u2019s four pandas as the only ones in the United States, and their loan agreement expires next year. The San Diego Zoo has not had any giant pandas since 2019, and the last panda at the Memphis Zoo returned to China in April.  \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation,\u201d Xi said, \u201cand do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples.\u201d Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.

        "title": "Xi and Biden end yearlong silence, finding common ground on AI, fentanyl and military communications",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 President Joe Biden met face to face with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Wednesday and said afterward they had agreed to revive dormant military communication channels, crack down on fentanyl trafficking and work jointly to address rapid advances in artificial intelligence. The four-hour summit broke a yearlong silence marked by rising tensions that have stoked fears that the two countries are on a path toward direct conflict. At a news conference afterward, Biden said, \"I believe they were some of the most productive and constructive discussions we've had.\" Having gone a full year without speaking, much less meeting in person, the two leaders agreed that they could now pick up the phone and call each other directly when needed, Biden said. The summit took place at the 654-acre Filoli estate in Woodside, about 35 miles south of San Francisco, where the two leaders are also taking part in a separate summit meeting of Asian-Pacific nations. After a formal session with top advisers, Xi and Biden met again for a working lunch and later walked the grounds together in front of the cameras. They passed reporters at one point, and in response to a shouted question about how the talks were going, Biden said, \"Well,\" and gave a thumbs-up. There were no breakthroughs, however, on some long-standing issues \u2014 chiefly, the status of Taiwan \u2014 that have soured relations between the world's two largest economic powers. Nor was there any sign that Biden was reassessing his belief that China is a formidable and potentially dangerous competitor. He cautioned that he won't accept Chinese promises to cooperate at face value. When a reporter asked whether he trusted Xi, Biden repeated a phrase former President Ronald Reagan used when he negotiated arms control accords with the old Soviet Union in the 1980s: \"Trust but verify.\" Asked at the news conference whether he saw Xi as a dictator \u2014 the word he used to describe Xi over the summer \u2014 Biden said he did. \u201cHe\u2019s a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is a communist country that\u2019s based on a form of government totally different than ours,\u201d he said. Responding Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry criticized Biden\u2019s remark as \u201cextremely wrong and irresponsible political manipulation.\u201d \"The term came out naturally but also quite undiplomatically given that they just had the summit meeting and the Chinese are particularly sensitive about this,\" Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, said in an email. \"I think Biden might feel more at ease using the term now the meeting is over.\" She added that China will not abandon the agreement at this point but that Biden's remark doesn\u2019t cast a very promising light\" on the future of bilateral relations. Biden said earlier: \"We're in a competitive relationship, China and the United States, but my responsibility is to make this rational and manageable, so it doesn't result in conflict. That's what I'm all about. That's what this is about.\" Still, Biden hailed the three areas in which the sides reached consensus. The U.S. discussed with China a plan to cut down the flow of fentanyl precursors that are contributing to an illegal drug scourge in the U.S., according to a senior administration official who briefed the media pool. \u201cThe president basically said, look, this one of the worst drug problems the United States has ever faced. Tens of thousands of American perishing annually,\" the official said. After close calls between Chinese and American warships and planes, U.S. officials are delighted that China will reopen military communication lines. In announcing the resumption of military-to-military talks, which aim to prevent inadvertent conflict, Biden said \u201cvital miscalculations\u201d can cause \u201creal trouble.\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet with China\u2019s defense minister, once the person is named, the U.S. official said. China\u2019s previous defense minister, Li Shangfu, departed the administration weeks ago. Li had been sanctioned by the U.S. The official also said the countries are establishing \u201coperational engagements,\u201d allowing senior military commanders to engage with counterparts. Taiwan remains a knotty problem for both sides. Xi wants to unify China and Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that China claims as its own. While Biden's \"one China\" policy does not favor Taiwan independence, he has objected to what he sees as aggressive military actions that have menaced Taiwan. Biden asked that China respect Taiwan's electoral process ahead of the island's presidential election in January. In response, Xi argued that peace is \"all well and good\" but that eventually they needed to move toward resolution, the U.S. official said. Hua Chunying, a Chinese official who attended the larger bilateral meeting, said on X that Xi said the \"Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.\" She added that the U.S. should \"support China's peaceful reunification.\" \"China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,\" she said in the post. Biden and Xi greeted each other at 11:15 a.m. local time. As Xi left his limousine, he walked toward the historic country house along a red carpet and was greeted by Biden, who had arrived earlier and was awaiting him in the doorway. The two briefly shook hands and waved to the media corps before they entered the building. Inside, they faced each other across a long rectangular table, with Chinese and American flags at the far end. They were flanked by their respective delegations. Biden sat between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In his opening remarks, Biden said previous meetings between the two leaders have \"always been candid, straightforward and useful.\" He said competition between China and the U.S. must not veer into conflict, a point he has been stressing for months. \"I value our conversation, because I think it\u2019s paramount that you and I understand each other clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication,\u201d Biden said. Xi spoke next. Through an interpreter, he said the two countries have the most important bilateral relationship in the world. \"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\" Xi said. \"It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflicts and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides.\" The summit featured a few lighter moments. Biden will turn 81 on Monday. Xi\u2019s wife shares the same birthdate. When Biden said he wished her a happy birthday, Xi said he had been working so hard that he\u2019d forgotten. He thanked Biden for the reminder, the official said. After the news conference, Biden was scheduled to attend an evening reception in San Francisco for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders, which Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden will also attend. The summit is the first time the two presidents have met since a three-hour session on the sidelines of a summit in Bali, Indonesia, a year ago. The visit is also the first time Xi has stepped foot in the U.S. since 2017. In the hours before the meeting, John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, told reporters: \u201cI think we\u2019re all expecting that this will be a productive discussion today. And hopefully, a precursor to much more communication and dialogue between our two teams going forward.\u201d Over the past year, relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated in ways that elevate the risk of an unwanted confrontation, U.S. officials said. As an example, when the Biden administration shot down a Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. in February, the Defense Department had no one in China to contact because Beijing had closed an important military communications channel, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Tuesday while previewing the Biden-Xi meeting. \u201cIt is true that when the Chinese spy balloon went across the United States, we had no way to communicate with the Chinese,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s not responsible, and we hope to at least take some preliminary steps\" toward improving communications. U.S. officials believe Biden entered the meeting from a position of strength. While the Chinese economy is struggling with high youth unemployment and disinvestment from foreign companies, Biden has boasted of robust economic growth in the U.S., accompanied by a low jobless rate. After he arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday, Biden attended an evening fundraising event at which he said: \u201cPresident Xi is another example of how re-establishing American leadership in the world is taking hold. They\u2019ve got real problems, folks.\u201d Preparation for the summit was months in the making. In the run-up, Blinken had given priority to resuming military-to-military talks with China, as well as curbing the flow of narcotics into the U.S., according to a U.S. official involved with China policy. Blinken raised the issues directly with Chinese officials four times since his visit to China in June, including with top Xi administration officials like Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi. When Wang visited the U.S., Blinken described a Chinese fighter jet\u2019s close call with a U.S. warplane flying in international airspace over the South China Sea. He noted that the leaders were sitting at a table about 10 feet long \u2014 the distance between the two aircraft during the near-collision, the source said. Blinken used the anecdote to illustrate the risk of an accidental collision and show why the two countries need to revive military communication channels.

        "title": "Holiday shopping season might be off to a slow start",
        "content": "With Black Friday only about a week away, there are signs consumers aren't in a jolly, high-spending mood. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales by U.S. retailers were 0.1% lower in October than in September. The agency said department store sales fell 1% and clothing sales were unchanged from the previous month. That total excludes sales at gas stations and auto parts retailers. A survey from the National Retail Federation and CNBC, also released Wednesday, showed similar results, with sales unchanged from September to October. The lack of improvement might be a sign shoppers are going to pinch their pennies over the holidays this year. Ted Rossman, an analyst who covers topics including personal finance for Bankrate, said the report is an \"ominous\" sign for November and December. \"Nonstore retailers, basically a proxy for e-commerce shops, only expanded their sales 0.2% from September to October. That\u2019s surprising given all of the early holiday promotions,\" Rossman wrote, noting that Target, Amazon and Walmart all had major promotions. \"Consumer sentiment remains depressed and retailers have to be getting nervous about the all-important holiday period.\" Consumers are indeed feeling more pressure lately, and that might leave them reluctant to spend. Interest rates on credit cards are at longtime highs. People are carrying bigger balances on their cards than they had previously. Student loan payments just resumed after a long pause. And while the pace of inflation has slowed, prices are still notably higher than they were a few years ago. Meanwhile, the job market isn\u2019t quite as strong as it has been, although unemployment is very low. And more than three years after the last round of pandemic stimulus, people have spent most of what they'd saved up. All of that is leaving consumers feeling gloomy. The University of Michigan says consumer sentiment has fallen for four months in a row, although it remains better than it was a year ago. The school found that people with lower incomes were most concerned. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index shows that almost 70% of respondents expect a recession in the next 12 months. Not everyone thinks retailers are going to get the equivalent of a lump of coal. Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliance, said Wednesday's retail sales data was a bit better than Wall Street experts had expected. \"Given expectations that retail sales would contract month-over-month, instead we saw slight gains in the data. In addition, the prior month\u2019s data was revised higher as well, showing that this month wasn\u2019t a statistical fluke,\" Zaccarelli wrote. A group of Wells Fargo economists, including senior economist Tim Quinlan, economist Shannon Seery and economic analyst Jeremiah Kohl, wrote in October that sales will grow 5% compared to last year. That sounds pretty good, and is above a longer-term average, but they acknowledged that it might feel a bit sluggish to retailers because growth over the previous couple of years was unusually strong. \"Purchasing power is fading and competition for consumer wallets is rising. Both of these factors have contributed to lower sales momentum and will likely remain a headwind to overall purchases this holiday season,\" they said.

        "title": "Disney touts $40 billion economic impact in Florida as it battles DeSantis in court",
        "content": "Disney on Tuesday released a study showing its economic impact in Florida at $40.3 billion as it battles Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his appointees over their takeover of the district that governs the entertainment company\u2019s massive theme park resort in central Florida. Disney accounted for 263,000 jobs in Florida, more than three times the actual workforce at Walt Disney World, according to the study conducted by Oxford Economics and commissioned by Disney, covering fiscal year 2022. Besides direct employment and spending, the study attributed the company\u2019s multibillion-dollar impact to indirect influences, such as supply chain and employees\u2019 spending. The jobs include Disney employees as well as jobs supported by visitor spending off Disney World property. Disney employs 82,000 workers in Florida, not only at Disney World outside Orlando, but also Disney Cruise Line in Port Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, as well as a resort in Vero Beach. In central Florida, Disney directly accounts for 1 in 8 jobs, and for every direct job, another 1.7 jobs are supported across Florida, Oxford Economics said. The time period in the study is before the takeover earlier this year of Disney World\u2019s governing district by DeSantis and his appointees after Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Disney officials in the past year have said the company plans to invest an additional $17 billion over the next decade in central Florida, including potentially adding another 13,000 jobs. However, the company has shown a willingness to pull back investing in the Sunshine State. Earlier this year, Disney scrapped plans to relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development, an investment estimated at $1 billion. Disney World already has four theme parks, more than 25 hotels, two water parks and a shopping and dining district on 25,000 acres (10,117 hectares). Disney is battling DeSantis and his appointees in federal and state courts over the takeover of what was formally called the Reedy Creek Improvement District but was renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District after DeSantis appointees gained control. The district was created by the Florida Legislature in 1967 to handle municipal services like firefighting, road repairs and waste hauling, and it was controlled by Disney supporters until earlier this year. Before control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees said the \u201celeventh-hour deals\u201d neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney has filed counterclaims, which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Disney also has sued DeSantis, a state agency and DeSantis appointees on the district\u2019s board in federal court in Tallahassee, saying the company\u2019s free speech rights were violated when the governor and Republican lawmakers targeted it for expressing opposition to the law dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d by its critics. In an earnings report last week, Disney noted that while its theme parks worldwide had a year-to-year increase in operating income, it had decreased at the Florida theme park resort due to costs related to the closure of its immersive Star Wars-themed two-night experience and lower visitor spending from a decrease in hotel rates.

        "content": "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday confirmed that Google pays Apple 36% of Safari search revenue under the terms of a default search agreement that is core to the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust claims. Pichai was testifying in a separate lawsuit filed against Google by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. An expert witness testifying on Google\u2019s behalf in Washington, D.C., antitrust proceedings revealed the 36% figure in open court on Monday, apparently by accident. An attorney for Epic asked Pichai if the detail presented by Google\u2019s witness was accurate. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Pichai responded. The Epic attorney then alleged that Google pays Samsung, Android\u2019s largest hardware partner, less than half of what it pays to Apple. Pichai replied that while he didn\u2019t know for certain, it was possible. \u201cIt\u2019s like apples and oranges,\u201d Pichai said about the Samsung deal. He added that the deals sometimes pay carriers. In later questioning, Pichai said that Google competes \u201cfiercely with Apple.\u201d Google spent nearly $49 billion in Traffic Acquisition Costs in 2022. Google\u2019s TAC costs include all of Google\u2019s payments to companies like Apple and Samsung to place its search engine in front of users. The breakdown of Google\u2019s revenue-sharing agreement with Apple had been not been revealed until the Monday disclosure in court from University of Chicago economics professor Kevin Murphy. Murphy had been testifying on Google\u2019s behalf and was responding to questions from Alphabet\u2019s lead attorney, Williams & Connolly partner John Schmidtlein, when he revealed the figure. Alphabet is in the middle of multiple legal battles. It faces two separate Justice Department suits in Virginia and Washington, D.C., related to allegedly anticompetitive behavior. Alphabet is also being sued by Epic Games, which has alleged that the company maintained an illegal monopoly with its Google Play store. Epic filed a similar suit against Apple but lost in federal appeals court in April.

        "content": "Workers at Ford, Stellantis and General Motors are weighing in on the new contracts proposed by their union and the Big Three \u2014 and more than a few of them seem unsatisfied with what they're being offered. According to a document submitted to the NBC affiliate WSMV-TV in Nashville, workers at GM's Spring Hill Manufacturing plant rejected the contract this week. The document showed that about 72% of production workers and 56% of skilled trade workers opposed the deal. A majority of employees at UAW Local 602 in Lansing, Michigan, also reportedly voted against the contract this week. Those are some of the latest GM employees who have said no to the contract after the six-week strike. The UAW's \"ratification trackers,\" which are updated hourly, show that almost 16,000 GM employees have voted on the contract so far, and they're backing the deal by a narrow margin of 52% to 48%. The proposed contracts were negotiated after members of the UAW went on strike on Sept. 15. If majorities at each automaker approve, the pacts will last through April 30, 2028. Union members will get an 11% initial wage increase and a total pay increase of 25% over the course of the 4\u00bd year deal. The new contracts also reinstate cost-of-living adjustments, let workers reach top wages in three years instead of eight, and protect their right to strike over plant closures. Both the United Auto Workers and the carmakers described the deals as \"record\" contracts based on those pay increases. The union also said that members were regaining some of the benefits they agreed to give up after the Great Recession to help keep the automakers alive. Compared to GM, Ford employees seem a bit more enthusiastic. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 25,000 votes among Ford employees had been counted and the UAW said 65.9% supported ratification. Ford was the first of the Big Three to reach an agreement with the UAW, and its members are scheduled to finish voting on the proposed contact on Friday. The first group of Ford employees to weigh in was Local 900 at the Michigan assembly plant, which was the first Ford plant to go on strike. The UAW said 82% of those members voted to ratify the contract, with more than 3,000 'yes' votes. Fewer Stellantis employees have voted so far, but the UAW tracker shows that more than 80% of the 6,000 voters approved. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Home Depot says the worst of inflation is over \u2014 that could be good news for retailers and shoppers",
        "content": "Even as Home Depot forecast sales declines, the retailer had good news for investors and consumers on Tuesday. \u201cI think the most important observation we\u2019ve made is that the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said on an earnings call. Shares of the retailer rose by nearly 6% in early trading after the company beat quarterly earnings expectations, driving a rally for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company\u2019s comments also came as federal data on Tuesday morning showed that inflation was flat in October from the prior month. Home Depot kicked off a much-anticipated week of retail earnings that includes other household names, such as Walmart, Target and Macy\u2019s. All of the retailers have struggled with consumers who have become more selective about spending, particularly on pricier and discretionary items, as they pay more for necessities like groceries. Home Depot is no exception. For multiple quarters, its customers have bought fewer big-ticket items and taken on smaller, less expensive projects. Yet with its comments on Tuesday, Home Depot gave fresh hope that consumers and the broader economy could soon see relief. In the short term, cooling inflation reduces sales numbers for retailers, including Home Depot. Yet long term, if prices level off or even start to drop, it can free up extra money that shoppers can spend elsewhere. Plus, cooling inflation could speed along the end of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been trying to tame decades-high price increases without tipping the economy into a recession. Still, Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson, said relief won\u2019t come soon enough for the holiday season. He expects modest sales growth for retailers.  \u201cLess inflation can invite back in some discretionary spending, but that\u2019s offset by the fact it\u2019s generally a pretty soft spending environment,\u201d he said. At Home Depot, McPhail has described 2023 as \u201ca year of moderation\u201d after the boom in home improvement during the Covid pandemic. The retailer predicts a drop in sales from last year. Yet the normalization of other trends has brought predictability for the business and customers, he said. \u201cSome prices are settling at levels higher than 2022,\u201d McPhail said. \u201cOthers are settling lower. But we\u2019re seeing some stabilization there.\u201d Appliances, which sometimes requires months-long wait times, are back in stock. Those healthier inventory levels have lifted sales in the category, said Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising, on the earnings call. Yet some factors that drive inflation are beyond retailers\u2019 control and influence consumers\u2019 decisions, too. Just take the cost of painting a living room, CEO Ted Decker said on the earnings call. He said Home Depot remains focused on offering low prices. But, he added, it\u2019s backed off on the kinds of promotions that don\u2019t make a difference. He said cutting the price of paint by $10 doesn\u2019t put a dent in the bigger cost: Paying the painters. Melissa Repko is a retail and consumer reporters for CNBC.com. ",

        "title": "Coast Guard searches for man missing from Louisiana cruise ship",
        "content": "Surveillance video on a Carnival cruise ship from which a 28-year-old man went missing shows him jumping from a deck early Monday, a spokesman for the cruise line said Tuesday. The Coast Guard is searching for Tyler Barnett, who went missing Monday morning from the Carnival Glory, which is bound for Montego Bay, Jamaica. Barnett, of Houma, Louisiana, the father of twin girls, was reported missing that afternoon, and the Coast Guard sent two aircraft to search, following the ship\u2019s track toward Jamaica, it said. Matt Lupoli, Carnival\u2019s senior manager of public relations, said video appears to show the missing passenger jumping overboard. \u201cAfter multiple reviews of the shipboard surveillance video, it appears that the guest reported missing on Monday jumped from the ship\u2019s Deck 4 at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can be seen climbing on a lifeboat and jumping from there,\u201d Lupoli said. The Coast Guard has been informed of the video and has been able to narrow its search effort, Petty Officer 2nd Class Jose Hernandez said. The search had been over a 200-mile area. The more specific location also means the Coast Guard has been able to launch an HC-130 plane and an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, he said. The search is 30 miles southwest of Southwest Pass, Louisiana, the Coast Guard said. The Carnival Glory left Louisiana for Montego Bay and is due to arrive Wednesday, the cruise line said. Tyler Barnett's sister, Destiny Barnett, and 13 other relatives were also on the cruise. \"It makes you feel crazy to be stuck on a ship where everyone else is having a good time,\" Destiny Barnett said. \"It was supposed to be a vacation, but for us, it's hell.\" The cruise is also scheduled to stop at Grand Cayman Island and Cozumel, Mexico, before it returns to New Orleans on Sunday, according to its itinerary. Destiny Barnett said her brother's card was last used at his cabin door. His cellphone was in his room, and his bed had not been slept in. Barnett's grandmother Dirlean Tate Mason, who is not on the cruise, is anxiously waiting for news. She said that Tyler Barnett works on the river barges in Louisiana and that she does not think he would try to take his own life. \u201cHe loves his girls,\u201d she said. \"I just want answers, and I'm holding out for hope,\" she said. The Coast Guard issued broadcasts notifying mariners in the Gulf of Mexico that a person may have fallen overboard, a spokesman said. In a post on X, the Coast Guard said search efforts were paused Monday night because of dangerous weather conditions, including rough seas and strong winds. It said it would launch more search assets as soon as conditions allowed. According to data from the cruise industry consultancy firm GP Wild, there were 212 man overboard incidents on cruise ships from 2009 to 2019. Forty-eight of those passengers were rescued. In April, Coast Guard crews suspended a search for an Australian passenger who fell off a cruise off Hawaii after a three-day search yielded no results.

        "title": "Prices held steady in October as inflation slowed further",
        "content": "Prices for consumers are growing at a slower pace, the U.S. government reported Tuesday morning, as overall prices in October were the same as what consumers paid in September. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says prices in October were unchanged as gasoline prices declined and shelter costs continued to rise. Its Consumer Price Index rose 3.2% compared to a year ago, the latest sign that inflation is slowing down as interest rates rise and the job market gives up some of the strength it has shown in the last few years. The CPI results were about equal to what experts had expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal had projected an 0.1% increase in prices compared to September, and 3.2% from October 2022. Core prices, which exclude food and energy prices because they can be highly volatile, rose 4% compared to October 2022. The BLS said that was the slowest pace of growth it has recorded since September 2021. The BLS said that compared to a year ago, food prices climbed 3.3% and shelter costs rose 6.7%. The price of used cars and trucks fell 7.1%, continuing a long decline after those prices had spiked in the early stages of the pandemic. Gasoline prices were down 5.3% from a year ago, which contributed to an overall drop in energy costs. \"The usual trouble spots \u2014 shelter, motor vehicle insurance, and personal care \u2014 still remain,\" wrote Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. \"Shelter has accounted for 70% of the increase in core prices over the past year and offset the 5% decline in gasoline prices during October.\u201d While more apartments are being built, McBride says that's not showing up in rents right now. The report will be a major factor in the Federal Reserve\u2019s next decision on interest rates in December. Stocks rose Tuesday morning, as investors concluded that the report makes it more likely that the Fed is done raising interest rates for the time being. At 9:46 a.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.6% and the tech stock-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 2.1%. Higher interest rates tend to slow down the economy and cut into profits for most businesses, so relatively lower rates are seen as better for stocks. Higher rates on bonds are a more appealing investment relative to stocks because their payments increase when rates do. The central U.S. bank will meet for the final time this year Dec. 12 and 13. It left rates alone in September and October after a series of steep increases throughout 2022 and early this year. Officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell have suggested that the central bank is comfortable with the progress it has made in reducing inflation so far. U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% annually in June 2022, so it has slowed significantly even though it remains well above the 2% rate the Fed says it wants to achieve. In September, overall prices rose 0.2% from August, and CPI was up 3.7% over the previous 12 months. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Government shutdown November deadline: What happens to Social Security payments and more",
        "content": "If the federal government shuts down Saturday, numerous publicly funded agencies will stop work and their employees won\u2019t be paid, but Social Security checks will still go out. Social Security is considered a mandatory program, and it isn\u2019t funded by the shorter-term appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. That means its operations and funding don\u2019t stop when the government shuts down. That\u2019s important for a large proportion of Americans, as about 67 million people receive monthly Social Security benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. Those benefits go primarily to retirees but also to people with disabilities, as well as dependents of deceased beneficiaries.  Medicare and Veterans Affairs benefits also continue to be distributed during a shutdown. The federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday if Congress does not pass a bill to provide more funding. The GOP has a narrow majority in the House, and a group of hard-line conservatives is holding out from the rest of Republicans and demanding deep cuts in government spending. President Joe Biden and the Democrats, who control the Senate, oppose those cuts. Follow live updates on the government shutdown bill vote In the event of a shutdown, \u201cnonessential\u201d actions would stop, and 4 million federal employees would not receive paychecks. Some, including members of the military, would work without pay and would receive back pay later on, after a new funding bill is passed and signed into law. Other federal employees would be furloughed and would not report to work. And a shutdown would stop many other federal programs and services. The Biden administration said in September, when a shutdown looked likely, that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, would stop operating one or two days into a shutdown. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that some states might be able to keep their programs running a bit longer than that. WIC is a program intended to help low-income pregnant and postpartum women, as well as children under age 5, access healthier food. According to the Agriculture Department, more than 6 million people received WIC benefits each month in 2022, including about 39% of all U.S. infants. A long shutdown could harm the economy, as well. The longest shutdown lasted for 35 days, from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, and the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it cost the U.S. economy at least $11 billion directly, with indirect costs that were harder to quantify. A government shutdown should not be confused with a debt ceiling standoff. The U.S. reached its borrowing limit, called the debt ceiling, earlier this year. That standoff could have prevented Social Security checks from going out had it lasted long enough, but after a protracted impasse, congressional Republicans and Democrats agreed on a deal to prevent it.

        "title": "Argentina\u2019s 100% inflation draws crowds to used clothes markets: 'Can't buy new jeans'",
        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Hard-up Argentines, tightening their purse strings with inflation at 140% and rising, are increasingly turning to second-hand clothing markets, both to find affordable bargains and to raise extra cash from selling old garments. The South American nation, the region\u2019s no. 2 economy and a major grains exporter, is facing its worst crisis in decades. Two-fifths of people live in poverty and a looming recession is shaking up Argentina\u2019s presidential election run-off next Sunday. Rising voter anger is propelling a radical outsider, Javier Milei, the slight favorite in polls to beat economy minister Sergio Massa, the candidate of the ruling Peronist coalition, whose bid has been hobbled by his failure to rein in rising prices. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go to the mall and buy something you like as you did before. Today prices are unthinkable,\u201d said 22-year-old student Aylen Chiclana in Buenos Aires. New jeans cost more than double the price a year ago and that purchase alone represents over one-third of Argentina\u2019s monthly minimum wage. Annualized inflation, already 138%, is set to rise further when authorities release official data for October on Monday, with the monthly rise alone estimated to be around 10%, down slightly from peaks in August and September. Argentina has for years battled high inflation, which economists blame on money printing and an entrenched lack of confidence in the local peso. Inflation has accelerated over the last year to its highest since 1991. Beatriz Lauricio, a 62-year-old semi-retired teacher, said that she and her husband, a bus company employee, go on weekends to a clothing fair to sell old garments to make ends meet. \u201cWe\u2019re middle class, lower middle class I would say. We have our jobs but we need to come to the fair,\u201d she said, adding that when it was canceled one weekend due to bad weather the couple\u2019s finances \u201ccollapsed\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this as a little extra so we can go on vacation to Brazil, we do it out of daily necessity,\u201d Lauricio said. Mar\u00eda Silvina Perasso, the organizer of the clothing fair in Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, said many people shop there because prices have risen far faster than salaries. Local monthly minimum wage is 132,000 pesos, $377 at the official exchange rate but half that at real street rates due to capital controls \u2014 restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. \u201cWith the economy the way it is, they buy clothes at 5% or 10% of the value that comes from a store and they can buy things for their families,\u201d she said. Mar\u00eda Teresa Ortiz, a 68-year-old retiree, lives off her pension and from casual sewing work, where she earns 400 pesos an hour, officially about a dollar. She goes to the fair to be able to afford clothes she otherwise couldn\u2019t buy. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t buy new things. You can\u2019t buy new sneakers, you can\u2019t buy new flip-flops, you can\u2019t buy new jeans, you can\u2019t buy a shirt or a T-shirt either. So you have to look for them at the fairs,\u201d she said. ",

        "title": "Payments app Zelle begins refunds for customers hurt by imposter scams",
        "content": "Banks on the payment app Zelle have begun refunding victims of imposter scams to address consumer protection concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog, in a major policy change. The 2,100 financial firms on Zelle, a peer-to-peer network owned by seven banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers as of June 30 for customers duped into sending money to scammers claiming to be from a government agency, bank or existing service provider, said Early Warning Services (EWS), the banks\u2019 company that owns Zelle. That\u2019s \u201cwell above existing legal and regulatory requirements,\u201d Ben Chance, chief fraud risk officer at EWS, told Reuters. Federal rules require banks to reimburse customers for payments made without their authorization, such as by hackers, but not when customers themselves make the transfer. While Zelle disclosed Aug. 30 that it had introduced a new reimbursement benefit for \u201cspecific scam types,\u201d it has not previously provided details on its new imposter scam refund policy due to worries doing so might encourage criminals to make false scam claims, a spokesperson said. The new policy marks a major shift from last year when bankers, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, told lawmakers worried about rising scams that it was unreasonable to require banks to refund transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Following its launch in 2017, Zelle grew to become one of the largest U.S. peer-to-peer payments networks by total payments. A March 2022 New York Times report that scams were flourishing on Zelle caught the attention of lawmakers frequently critical of big banks, including Senator Elizabeth Warren. She and other lawmakers started an investigation, estimating that Zelle users had lost $440 million to all types of fraud in 2021 alone. During a Senate hearing last year, Warren told Dimon and other bank CEOs that they had created a \u201cperfect weapon\u201d for criminals but had not stood by their customers. More than 100 million people, all with U.S. bank accounts, have access to Zelle, according to EWS. Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam in 2022 across all payment methods in the U.S., accounting for $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Banks worry that covering the cost of authorized transactions will encourage more fraud and put them on the hook for potentially billions of dollars. Instead of requiring lenders to reimburse customers, EWS has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to claw back funds from the recipient\u2019s account and return them to the sender, said Chance. Lenders on Zelle are also now required to implement a tool that flags transfers with risky attributes, such as a payment to an account that has never transacted on the Zelle network, said Chance. He said Zelle has seen \u201ca step-change reduction\u201d in fraud and scam rates this year but declined to provide details. \u201cWe have had a strong set of controls since the launch of the network, and as part of our journey we have continued to evolve those controls... to keep pace with what we see is going on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. Chance said EWS has been engaging with policymakers on the need for a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to combating scams, including advocating for more dedicated law enforcement resources. Under pressure from Warren and other lawmakers, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) considered compelling lenders to reimburse scams, but Zelle\u2019s changes have so far satisfied the agency, said a person familiar with the matter. A CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on Zelle or potential rule changes, but said the agency is working to protect customers \u201cincluding by ensuring that financial institutions are living up to their investigation and error-resolution obligations.\u201d JPMorgan, Bank of America and Zelle\u2019s five other owner banks declined to comment. \u201cZelle\u2019s platform changes are long overdue,\u201d said Warren in a statement to Reuters. \u201cThe CFPB is standing with consumers, and I urge the agency to keep the pressure on Zelle to protect consumers from bad actors.\u201d Zelle has long argued its fraud and scam rates are low. It processed $629 billion worth of payments in 2022, according to the network, with 99.9% of transfers made without a fraud or scam report. It competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo that review situations case-by-case and have a purchase-protection program for eligible transactions that covers scams. Experts note that it is difficult to compare fraud and scam rates across platforms because classifications vary. Zelle\u2019s u-turn shows how banks are feeling competitive pressure to step up the \u201cmarket standard of care\u201d, said Trace Fooshee, a strategic advisor at Datos Insights. Still, regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better for customers since lenders\u2019 policies may be unclear or they may not follow them as promised, said Carla Sanchez-Adams, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cThe one thing that I think is problematic is that the consumer really wouldn\u2019t know that they have that option, and if they do know, and if the bank fails to reimburse them, there is no private remedy,\u201d she said, noting Zelle\u2019s policy change was nevertheless a \u201cgood first step.\u201d Payment fraud is expected to come up again when bank CEOs appear before the Senate next month, according to industry experts. This time, they believe they have a good story to tell. \u201cThe banks through Zelle \u2014 without regulation, without legislation \u2014 have actually proactively gone and said, we\u2019re going to make sure that we are... trying to address any kind of consumer issue or harm,\u201d said Lindsey Johnson, CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association.

        "title": "State attorney general, doctors and nurses criticize HCA over patient care at North Carolina's Mission Hospital",
        "content": "Four years after it bought Mission Hospital, an 815-bed facility in Asheville, North Carolina, HCA Healthcare is under fire in the region, threatened with a lawsuit by the state attorney general and facing criticism from nurses and at least 124 current and former Mission doctors who say HCA, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit hospital chain, is imperiling patient care at the facility in its pursuit of profits.  \u201cProfits over people is not an ethic, model, or aspiration that can deliver the quality of care we all expect and deserve,\u201d the doctors wrote in a letter to the independent monitor watching over management of the hospital. \u201cWe ask that hospital leadership look at economics as if people mattered.\u201d  On Oct. 31, the office of North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein wrote a letter to a foundation called Dogwood Health Trust, contending that HCA had violated the terms of the agreement it struck in 2019 when it bought Mission, a formerly nonprofit facility. Under that agreement, HCA had promised to continue providing an array of specific services for a decade at the hospital, including those involving behavioral health, emergency and trauma, oncology and pediatrics. Dogwood Health Trust was created when HCA bought Mission and works to improve the health of people in Western North Carolina.  The attorney general\u2019s office noted a breach of that agreement at Mission, citing diminished care in the hospital\u2019s oncology unit and its emergency department. The letter warned that if HCA does not cure the violations within 40 days, Stein \u201cis authorized to file suit.\u201d  A Mission spokeswoman said in a statement that the hospital is proud of the health care it provides and is disappointed by the attorney general\u2019s statements. \u201cWe continue to meet, and often exceed, the obligations under the asset purchase agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cThe independent monitor has confirmed compliance every year since the agreement was signed in 2019.\u201d The spokeswoman also provided a letter signed by 75 Mission practitioners who say patients continue to receive great care at the facility. Dr. Martin Palmeri, an oncologist who practiced at Mission before HCA took over and has continued to practice there, has a different view. Before the HCA buyout, he said in an interview with NBC News, local oncologists had developed excellent clinical programs to treat patients in the region. But after HCA acquired Mission, he said, nursing staff declined precipitously, the number of chemotherapy-trained pharmacists went from four to one, and the HCA labs services and turnaround times declined significantly. These deficiencies made it difficult to treat the full array of cancer patients coming to the hospital, he said.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to resolve these problems, Palmeri said the only choice he and his colleagues had was to stop offering three oncology services at which he said Mission had previously excelled. They were treatments for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and primary central nervous system lymphoma. \u201cWe felt it would be best for our patients to get their complex hematology care somewhere else,\u201d he said.  HCA declined to address Palmeri's criticisms. But a spokesman provided letters the company has sent to North Carolina officials disputing criticisms of its oncology services. The letters call them \u201cunfounded\u201d and say HCA\u2019s takeover of Mission has resulted in \u201cenhanced oncology services\u201d there. Moreover, nurse-to-patient ratios in oncology are \u201cflexible and adaptable to patient needs\u201d and consistent with best practices at HCA\u2019s cancer institute, the letters say.  Regarding understaffing of chemo-trained pharmacists, HCA told state officials in the letters that it is \u201ccontinuing to pursue opportunities to further enhance its pharmacy coverage and offerings.\u201d As for the lab problems, HCA said, \u201cMission is enhancing lab technician training to permit technician staffing that better targets volume needs on a day-to-day basis, which will further reduce processing times.\u201d   Mission\u2019s emergency department is another problem, according to doctors, nurses and patients. Bryan Robinson, a psychotherapist and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, said he has experienced the deficiencies first-hand. In 2019, before HCA took over the hospital, Robinson told NBC News he visited Mission\u2019s emergency department with chest pains. He did not have to wait, quickly received a stent and departed.  In late September, when he returned to Mission\u2019s emergency department with a low heart rate, he had a vastly different experience. After waiting for six hours, Robinson, 78, said he was called to a partitioned area where his diagnosis was discussed. It was neither private nor soundproof, he said, adding that he could hear about other patients\u2019 conditions as he felt sure they heard about his. He feels the hospital violated his privacy rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. He complained to Mission but did not get a response, he said.   \u201cThe worst part of all this is the doctors and nurses are phenomenal \u2014 this is not about them,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about this facility that has been turned into Kentucky Fried Hospital.\u201d  Mission\u2019s spokeswoman declined to comment on Robinson\u2019s points. The hospital\u2019s chief executive, Chad Patrick, declined NBC News\u2019 request for an interview.  HCA Healthcare operates almost 180 hospitals in the U.S. and generates billions in earnings. NBC News has reported extensively on HCA this year, examining company practices that more than 60 doctors and nurses say put profits ahead of patients. Among those reports was one in January on understaffing at HCA facilities, centering on Mission Hospital. Developments in the HCA Mission dispute have been covered closely by Asheville Watchdog, a free, local and not-for-profit news organization. On Nov. 1, EMS in nearby McDowell County, North Carolina, stopped transferring nonemergency patients to Mission Hospital, citing hourslong wait times for paramedics who must continue caring for their patients until they are admitted.  \u201cOur agency has worked with HCA for more than a year now to address and improve the extended wait times at Mission Hospital,\u201d Will Kehler, emergency services director for McDowell County, said in a press release. \u201cUnfortunately, we are making no progress and the situation is getting worse. Paramedics waiting 1-2 hours in the ER for a bed and a nurse to assume care is a situation that should never be deemed acceptable.\u201d  The Mission spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on the McDowell County EMS\u2019s action. The 124 doctors who signed the letter criticizing HCA\u2019s management of Mission included nine former chiefs of staff at the hospital, six former Mission board members, and 66 actively practicing physicians, including 17 who signed themselves as \u201canonymous,\u201d according to a former Mission doctor.  Several current and former Mission doctors who spoke with NBC News did so on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation by HCA. Noting that more than 200 doctors have left the hospital since HCA took over, the letter said: \u201cStifling the ability to speak freely undercuts the communication necessary for shared trust, continued improvement, and a greater good.\" The letter supporting Mission management signed by 75 practitioners at the hospital said care continues to be excellent. \u201cThere was turnover within both the hospital and physician leadership which meant new relationships had to be formed,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis, no doubt, was emotionally difficult and has taken time for us to heal.\u201d Two longtime Mission nurses spoke with NBC News for this article \u2014 Kelly Coward, a cardiac ICU nurse and Mark Klein, a vascular access nurse. After HCA acquired Mission, its nursing staff voted to unionize. Both Coward and Klein worked at Mission before the HCA takeover and still work there, and they discussed the differences. Most center on understaffing that threatens patients at the facility, they said. For example, each ICU nurse now often cares for three patients, they say, not one or two, as is safe; and charge nurses now have patients they must care for, which was not the case previously. Unit secretaries are gone, both nurses said, so there\u2019s no one to answer phones, and the number of nursing assistants has dwindled. As a result, nurses must pick up those duties, Coward and Klein said. In the emergency department, Klein said, \u201cthe triage area was never a treatment area before; now it is. The diminishment is across the board \u2014 HCA may be continuing services, but they\u2019re not continuing them at the same level.\u201d Coward described two important services for cardiac patients that vanished under HCA. One, called Heart Path, was an educational program that helped new heart patients understand their diagnoses. \u201cThe team of nurses told them what to expect,\u201d she said, \u201cmade sure they had their follow-up appointments and all the tools they needed to be successful with their new diagnosis.\u201d Under another program that disappeared under HCA, a nurse would follow patients recently diagnosed with heart disease through hospital discharge and subsequent appointments with physicians. \u201cThese people are going to slip through the cracks,\u201d Coward said. The Mission spokeswoman declined to comment on the nurses\u2019 criticisms. Scrutiny on HCA\u2019s stewardship of Mission coincides with a growing call from some physician groups to ban corporations practicing medicine, which they say imperils both patients and doctors. Over 30 states in the nation have laws barring corporations from practicing medicine to prevent health care from being tainted by commercial influences and the drive for profits. California, for example, prohibits corporations or other nonlicensed people or entities from practicing medicine, assisting in the unlicensed practice of medicine, employing physicians or owning physician practices. But few states enforce these laws and the corporate ownership of physician practices and other health care entities has grown significantly in recent years. \u201cProfit-oriented corporations are exerting control over physicians and the practice of medicine throughout the country,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Li, a practicing emergency physician and founder of Take Medicine Back, a public benefit company pushing for a bar on corporations practicing medicine. \u201cBut there are few places where this is more pronounced than in Western North Carolina where HCA took over Mission. The company has joined forces with Wall Street private-equity firms that employ physicians to extract wealth from the community and those physicians can be \u2018removed from the schedule\u2019 on a whim without justification. If they cross HCA administration, they have few alternative opportunities for work.\u201d The Mission spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Li\u2019s statement.  In Florida, where HCA operates 46 hospitals, two state lawmakers have drafted a bill to be submitted in the January legislative session that would bar entities other than physician groups, not-for-profit hospitals and medical schools from employing, controlling or interfering with a physician\u2019s clinical judgment.   Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat in the Florida House representing a part of Palm Beach County, is one of the bill\u2019s proponents. \u201cSeventy-four percent of Florida physicians are under corporate ownership,\u201d Skidmore told NBC News. \u201cThe practice of medicine has been stolen from physicians and I want to give it back to them.\u201d   She acknowledges a long fight ahead.

        "title": "Wind power industry in moment of reckoning as stocks fall and earnings crumble",
        "content": "Renewable energy firms are mostly suffering a dire earnings season as struggling supply chains, manufacturing faults and rising production costs eat into profits. With the world trying to transition at pace toward cleaner energy, equipment manufacturers are struggling to keep up with soaring global demand, leading to rising production costs and questions over the economic sustainability of large-scale projects from the industry\u2019s major players. Manufacturing faults, most notably at Siemens Energy\u2019s wind turbine subsidiary Siemens Gamesa, have emerged as companies race to build turbines at a greater pace and scale. The problems at Gamesa led Siemens Energy to scrap its profit forecast earlier this year, and last month the company sought guarantees of up to 15 billion euros ($16 billion) from the German government. Specialist wind energy firms are also often finding themselves outbid for seabed licenses by traditional oil and gas players. Should they win a contract, electricity prices are often too low to justify the manufacturing costs, leaving companies looking to their governments in Europe and the U.S. to deliver greater subsidies and restore balance to the market. As a result, most wind energy stocks are down sharply since the turn of the year. In a report published last week, Allianz Research noted that the eight largest renewable energy firms in the world reported a combined total $3 billion decrease in assets in the first half of the year, with wind projects in particular facing turbulent conditions. The firm\u2019s economists said the past earnings season was a \u201clearning moment\u201d for the industry. \u201cThe whole sector is grappling with rising construction and financing costs, quality-control problems and supply-chain issues. Inflation and global energy-price fluctuations have also led to increased costs for wind-power projects, casting doubt over the feasibility of many ventures,\u201d Allianz Research economists said. \u201cSome projects in the U.S. but also in the U.K. are at risk of being abandoned if governments do not offer support. As these projects were initiated before the energy crisis, with guaranteed feed-in-tariffs that were low, they are now becoming more and more unprofitable.\u201d Although balance sheets remain solid, renewables companies have been writing down assets and cutting their earnings outlooks. Danish company \u00d8rsted announced last week that it was scrapping the development of two offshore projects in the U.S., with related impairments totaling $5.6 billion. However, compatriot Vestas offered a ray of hope. The company posted a third-quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) before special items of 70 million euros ($74.73 million), well above the 31 million euros projected in a company-compiled consensus. However, it also warned that external factors clouded its near-term outlook, pulling back its full-year investment and margin guidance. Its CEO Henrik Andersen told CNBC Wednesday that the sector was at an inflection point and that the market would eventually identify its \u201cwinners and losers\u201d over time. \u201cWe are very disciplined, we work with our customers and partners can rely on us, and governments can rely on us. That, I hope, creates the strong foundation for being one of the winners in the industry,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken, but you can\u2019t close your eyes and hope that any project you embark into discussions will always come through if the macroeconomic factors change.\u201d Jacob Pedersen, senior analyst at Sydbank, agreed that Vestas in particular was well-positioned to move forward, but that both companies and policymakers needed to rethink their strategies if the transition to net zero was to be realistic. \u201cWe know a huge part of the problem is related to the projects that were won back in 2019/20 and at low prices. Since then, inflation and interests have gone up, it\u2019s become much more expensive to realize these projects, and that has left an order book of deficits, and that order book is now being smaller and smaller as time goes by,\u201d Pedersen told CNBC\u2019s \u201cStreet Signs Europe\u201d on Wednesday. Pedersen added that there is a \u201chuge need for recalibration of the political vie\u201d on the cost of the planned energy transition, given that wind turbines have increased in price by on average 20-30% since 2020. \u201cThe transition to wind turbines, to a greener energy portfolio around the world is getting more expensive, and as such, I think also we have seen some indications \u2014 we know that the U.S. is a huge problem for the offshore industry at the moment because of the rise in interest rates,\u201d Pedersen explained. \u201cBut we have seen the newest projects being awarded on much, much better terms and terms that should be good for companies to generate a profit moving forward.\u201d The European Commission announced a new Wind Power Action Plan last month, aimed at significantly increasing wind installed capacity. Pedersen said this was evidence that the necessary recalibration is underway, but that it would not be achieved overnight. \u201cThis is a process that takes time and in order for project developers to invest in new projects, in order for wind turbine producers to invest in the needed capacity to get us to where the politicians have their goals, much more is needed, and these companies simply haven\u2019t got the cash to invest as much as is needed at the moment,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Are fears of a shoplifting surge running away from the facts?",
        "content": "Americans are starting to feel like shoplifting is becoming an epidemic. It\u2019s becoming a mainstream worry that is contributing to fears about crime and the fate of major cities. New York City is experimenting with new ways to address shoplifting, for example, as complaints of stealing from retailers reportedly increased 77% from 2017 to 2022. In October, former President Donald Trump said he would support shooting shoplifters, an indication that he sees those fears as a political asset. To hear some retailers explain it, an outbreak of shoplifting, and especially \u201corganized retail theft,\u201d where merchandise is stolen en masse and resold online, is forcing them to close some stores and lock up merchandise elsewhere. \u201cWe are living in a nation where stealing is no longer considered a crime, and those stealing are not criminals,\u201d David Johnston, the vice president of asset protection and retail operations for the Washington, D.C.-based National Retail Federation, wrote in September. But for all of the extreme statements, it\u2019s hard to tell if there has really been a notable increase in shoplifting nationwide. Law enforcement often does not distinguish between theft from retailers and other kinds of robbery. The broad category of larceny, however, is lower than it was before the pandemic. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, says larceny fell 7% in the first half of 2023 compared to the same time period in 2019. Dylan Carden and Phillip Blee, two analysts for the financial services firm William Blair & Co., say that on a national level, it looks like theft and other forms of inventory loss \u2014 which retailers call \u201cshrink\u201d \u2014 are just returning to normal after they fell to unusually low levels in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic. But what\u2019s happening in individual cities can be very different from a national average, and the NRF has said its members are indeed reporting more theft. Along with other retailer groups, it spent the last couple of years focusing on organized retail theft specifically. The group points to surveys of its members to show that theft is rising. That survey data can\u2019t be easily verified, but even so, it shows the increase in overall theft has been less dramatic than the words the NRF is using to describe the situation. Still, its lobbying efforts resulted in a federal law that requires online sales platforms to collect and disclose some sellers\u2019 identities. This is meant to deter the sale of stolen goods online. Some states have passed similar laws. Now, the NRF and other groups are backing a new law that would impose harsher sentences for theft and make it easier to bring federal theft charges. Retailers say that will deter thieves, but critics argue it\u2019s reminiscent of the government\u2019s 1970s-era approach to combating illegal drugs, the hallmark of which featured heavy-handed policing tactics that led to mass incarceration. Journalists have pointed out that some of the stores being closed by companies like Target do not seem to be the same stores that have experienced the most shoplifting. On the other hand, not all shoplifting is reported, and the effects of an increase in theft could be complex. There are other factors that could contribute to greater shrink. For one, stores have generally cut back on staff, which can create more opportunities for theft. They also discourage employees from getting involved when they see someone stealing. There\u2019s also the increasing prevalence of self-checkout kiosks, which also create an opportunity to steal \u2014 or might push law-abiding customers to give up on a malfunctioning scanner and walk out of the store. Carden and Blee say that shoplifting, especially \u201corganized\u201d stealing of items that are later flipped online, seems to have increased somewhat. And they agree that retailers may not have a lot of options. Many of them are choosing to lock up merchandise even though it costs them sales when customers choose to shop elsewhere, or give up on trying to find an employee to retrieve the items they need. Even with that in mind, they say there are indications that companies are overstating the problem, and that in some cases, they are doing so to distract from their own mistakes. In a report published in October, Carden and Blee wrote that even though theft is \u201clikely elevated,\u201d retailers could be using that to pull attention away from recent internal struggles that have hurt their businesses, like inventory problems or an overreliance on price cuts to boost sales. \u201cWe also believe some more recent permanent store closures enacted under the cover of shrink relate to underperformance of these locations,\u201d they said. They added that company employees at distribution centers have more opportunities to steal merchandise than people inside stores, and those thefts are harder to trace \u2014 even though they are less dramatic than cellphone footage of \u201csmash and grab\u201d robberies. \u201cI don't think you\u2019ll ever hear a company tell you that employee theft is higher,\u201d Blee told NBC News in an interview. He said stores rarely talk about that kind of theft because it makes them look like they\u2019ve hired the wrong people and failed to keep track of their own merchandise. Neil Saunders, the managing director at the consulting company GlobalData, told NBC News that theft has been growing, but store closures are rarely the result of theft alone, no matter what retailers may say. And because companies don\u2019t disclose many details around shrink, there is speculation that they use it to cover for their own errors. \u201cIn some ways, theft is a great excuse as it absolves a retailer of any responsibility as theft is somewhat outside of their control,\u201d Saunders wrote in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone denies the problem of theft, it\u2019s just that a lot more transparency and nuance is needed in the discussion.\u201d Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Why buying a house is still financially beneficial even with sky-high prices and interest rates",
        "content": "It\u2019s becoming harder to enter the U.S. housing market, but for those who have managed to get in, the benefits have often been huge. Investing experts have long said that one of the best reasons to buy real estate is that it keeps more of its value than other investments, like stocks, when inflation gets high. That\u2019s been true during the inflation spike of the last two years. The Federal Reserve reports that the median value of a house, meaning the value of the house minus loans against it, such as mortgages, jumped 44% between 2019 and 2022. The Fed considered only primary residences in that analysis. Largely for that reason, the median net worth of U.S. homeowners was $396,000 at the end of 2022, compared to $10,000 for renters. The S&P 500 index rose about 32% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022, not counting dividends paid by index companies. That\u2019s also strong performance. But stocks have been more volatile, in part because their performance is closely linked to factors like corporate profits and investors\u2019 views about the future of the economy. \u201cIn a low-growth, high-inflationary environment, real estate is a very, very strong investment,\u201d said Jamie Battmer. He is the chief investment officer at Creative Planning, a wealth management and financial advice firm that works with clients who have nearly a quarter-trillion dollars in combined wealth. He adds that even in a backdrop like today\u2019s, where growth is solid and inflation is elevated but not as high as it was a year ago, real estate tends to do well compared to stocks and bonds. The steep increase in home values also means the housing market is becoming a bigger and bigger contributor to wealth inequality. It\u2019s such a powerful tool for creating wealth, even in bad times, that financial experts tell NBC News they\u2019re advising clients to strongly consider buying a home even with prices at all-time highs and mortgage rates at two-decade highs. \u201cThe perception people have is that it\u2019s a bad time to buy given the level of prices as well as interest rates,\u201d said Jason Obradovich, chief investment officer at New American Funding. But he said that\u2019s not necessarily true. One reason is that if mortgage rates decrease, prices will probably rise in response. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a ton of inflation, and yet real estate prices have climbed a lot,\u201d Obradovich said. The annual rate of inflation in 1980 was just over 14%. Mortgage interest rates that same year topped 16%. \u201cInterest rates have been coming down for about 40 straight years, and that obviously pushed up the value of real estate because people can afford a much larger payment.\u201d Obradovich says lower interest rates are inevitable because the Fed knows the U.S. economy requires it in order to achieve any kind of growth. \u201cWhen rates come down, you have the ability to refinance at a much lower rate,\u201d he said. When rates come down, prices are likely to go up again because it will be less costly to take out a mortgage. That means \u2014 for those who can afford it \u2014 it could be better to buy now than to wait. \u201cIf you rent, it will probably always go up,\u201d he said, referring to the cost of renting. Obradovich and Battmer both made a similar point about the role a home can have in a person\u2019s long-term finances. For many people, they both said, a house becomes a kind of forced retirement savings account. Every time they make a mortgage payment, they gain equity in the house, and the longer people own their homes, and the longer that prices rise, the more value they can get by taking out a home equity loan or borrowing against the value of their house. \u201cThe great American dream of home ownership is still alive and well and a key element of what just drives wealth for your average household,\u201d Battmer said.

        "title": "Moody\u2019s cuts U.S. outlook to negative, citing deficits and political polarization",
        "content": "Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Friday lowered its ratings outlook on the United States\u2019 government to negative from stable, pointing to rising risks to the nation\u2019s fiscal strength. The ratings agency has affirmed the long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings of the U.S. at Aaa. \u201cIn the context of higher interest rates, without effective fiscal policy measures to reduce government spending or increase revenues,\u201d the agency said. \u201cMoody\u2019s expects that the US\u2019 fiscal deficits will remain very large, significantly weakening debt affordability.\u201d Brinkmanship in Washington has also been a contributing factor, Moody\u2019s said. \u201cContinued political polarization within US Congress raises the risk that successive governments will not be able to reach consensus on a fiscal plan to slow the decline in debt affordability,\u201d the ratings agency said. As far as keeping the nation\u2019s ratings at Aaa, Moody\u2019s said that it expects the U.S. to \u201cretain its exceptional economic strength.\u201d \u201cFurther positive growth surprises over the medium term could at least slow the deterioration in debt affordability,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWhile the statement by Moody\u2019s maintains the United States\u2019 Aaa rating, we disagree with the shift to a negative outlook,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo in a statement. \u201cThe American economy remains strong, and Treasury securities are the world\u2019s preeminent safe and liquid asset.\u201d Moody\u2019s move to cut its outlook arrives as Congress faces the looming threat of a government shutdown once more. For now, the government is funded through Nov. 17, but lawmakers in Washington remain at loggerheads over a bill ahead of the deadline. Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has indicated that he will release a Republican government funding plan on Saturday, a move that would permit members time to read it before an expected Tuesday vote on the measure. But his plan to fund certain parts of the government through Dec. 7, and other parts through Jan. 19, known as a laddered continuing resolution, or CR, is dead on arrival in the White House and in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cMoody\u2019s decision to change the U.S. outlook is yet another consequence of Congressional Republican extremism and dysfunction,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Back in August, Fitch cut the U.S. long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA, citing \u201cexpected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,\u201d as well as an erosion of governance and a growing debt burden. Feuding in Washington was also an issue. \u201cThe repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,\u201d Fitch said at the time.

        "title": "Americans are unusually down on a solid economy. So far, they aren't spending \u2014 or voting \u2014 like it.",
        "content": "By just about any measure, the mighty American economy is chugging along nicely. The much-forecast recession of 2023 simply never happened. Instead, the jobless rate has remained below 4% for two years, wages are finally rising faster than inflation, and the economy revved up in the third quarter to post a nearly 5% growth. Bipartisan investments in infrastructure and computer chip manufacturing are just starting to bear fruit, fueling more economic tailwinds in the months ahead. In fact, in a note to clients Wednesday, Goldman Sachs declared \u201cthe hard part is over\u201d for efforts to shore up the global economy, predicting that inflation would continue to ease in 2024. The bank\u2019s researchers now expect a mere 15% risk that the United States will tip into a recession next year, following a spate of forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, voicing growing economic optimism. But many Americans don\u2019t share that view. Consumer sentiment dropped to a six-month low this month, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. A new Bankrate survey found half of Americans saying their overall financial situation is worse now than on Election Day 2020. And a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found 81% of voters rating the economy either \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d with just 19% calling it \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d Republican presidential candidates who debated in Miami Wednesday night looked to reinforce these views, making the case \u2014 sometimes by misrepresenting how gas prices and wages have trended \u2014 that the economy isn\u2019t working well with a Democrat in the White House. Yet despite the widespread pessimism, consumers \u2014 who drive two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 are still spending. \u201cPeople may be feeling bad, but they are not spending badly,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist of the payroll processing firm ADP. \u201cThey are spending like they are optimistic, even though they are reporting that they are pessimistic.\u201d What gives? The likely explanation is a gloomy soup of two major wars, ongoing domestic political divisions, a still-recent pandemic and price pressures that have slowed down dramatically but rarely reversed. \u201cIt\u2019s one word: inflation,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. In his view, inflation\u2019s lingering toll over the past year and a half more than makes up for the historic strength in the job market and other upsides to Americans\u2019 wallets. \u201cInflation is coming down, but prices aren\u2019t coming down, which is the source of the irritation\u201d for many, Hamrick said. And of course, the country\u2019s yawning economic inequality means that robust overall consumer spending figures can\u2019t help but mask wide disparities in households\u2019 finances. (\u201cThere\u2019s no one, monolithic \u2018consumer,\u2019\u201d Hamrick noted.) Inflation has eased from the painful 9.1% in the middle of last year to 3.7% in September. But while economists and Fed officials are cheered by that trend, ordinary Americans vividly recall a not-so-distant past when many things were cheaper. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk in November 2019 was $3.19. It surged to $4.20 in May 2022, before settling back to $3.97 this fall. \u201cWe\u2019re in an economy where the price level has taken a big, gigantic step up,\u201d said Richardson. Add in the highest interest rates in decades and borrowing money is more expensive, too \u2014 translating to steeper mortgage rates and credit card interest. A year out from the 2024 vote, it\u2019s an open question how, or even whether, Americans\u2019 economic malaise will play out either in the economy itself or at the ballot box. But both parties have been betting heavily that it will matter. President Joe Biden has been pounding the pavement to trumpet $5 billion in new investments to juice rural economies, hoping that voters will reward him and fellow Democrats for infrastructure projects ramping up across the country. Meanwhile, Republicans have raced to pin voters\u2019 frustrations over high prices on \u201cBidenomics,\u201d the term that the White House has used to try \u2014 with uncertain success \u2014 to brand the administration\u2019s economic policies. Of course, presidents frequently get too much credit and too much blame for the state of the economy on their watches, and pollsters note that voters tend to blame a leader for a declining economy more than they will credit for a good one. But if Tuesday\u2019s election results are any indication, there\u2019s no guarantee that next year\u2019s contest will hinge on the economy. In a number of races \u2014 albeit off-year ones that tend to draw a different mix of voters than those who turn out for presidential elections \u2014 other issues rose to the fore. Abortion access in particular has continued to propel Democrats to victories at the state and local level after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. In many cases, conservative voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, including for his handling of the economy, crossed party lines to back more expansive reproductive rights. If the past 12 months\u2019 mistaken economic predictions have illustrated anything, it\u2019s that a lot can change in a year, both in Americans\u2019 financial lives and the ways they feel about them. Reflecting on the dissonance between many of the economy\u2019s fundamentals and consumers\u2019 sour outlook, Richardson was circumspect. \u201cWhen that feeling starts translating into behavior,\u201d she said, \u201cI think that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to have to pay attention.\u201d Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News.

        "content": "The independent film powerhouse A24 is developing a biopic about tech mogul Elon Musk, set to be directed by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, according to a source close to the project. A24's project will be based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography of the controversial SpaceX and Tesla tycoon, \"Elon Musk,\" which was published in September. The studio nabbed the film rights to the book after a fierce bidding war, according to the source. \u201cThe deal was highly competitive with top studios and filmmakers in contention,\" the source said. A24 previously teamed with Aronofsky on last year's \"The Whale,\" starring Brendan Fraser in an Oscar-winning role. Aronofsky earned a best director Oscar nomination for \"Black Swan,\" which was released in 2010. Aronofsky is known for intense and sometimes surreal dramas such as \"Pi,\" \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"The Fountain\" and \"The Wrestler.\" The source said A24 will co-produce the Musk film with Aronofsky's production company, Protozoa Pictures. It was not immediately clear who would be tapped to portray Musk in the film. Puck reporter Matt Belloni, who first reported the news, suggested actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Paul Dano, Shia LaBeouf and Joaquin Phoenix. \"I\u2019d pick Michael Fassbender if he hadn\u2019t already starred in 'Steve Jobs,'\" Belloni wrote, referring to a 2015 film based on Isaacson's bestselling biography of the Apple founder. A24 was founded in 2012 and quickly established itself as one of the most influential film companies in modern Hollywood. The company distributed two movies that have won best picture at the Oscars: \"Moonlight\" and \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" The studio has also released critically acclaimed films such as \"Ex Machina,\" \"Room,\" \"Lady Bird,\" \"Eighth Grade and \"Uncut Gems.\" Daniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News.

        "content": "Vince McMahon plans to sell a substantial chunk of his stake in TKO, the parent company of WWE, the wrestling empire founded by his father, TKO said in a release Thursday TKO\u2019s stock fell 5% after the closing bell Thursday. The stock closed at $84.90 during regular trading. McMahon intends to sell 8.4 million of his shares, worth about $700 million. He owned more than 28 million shares as of August, according to a regulatory filing. The company said it and several executives are looking to buy shares from McMahon. The longtime wrestling honcho has a net worth of $2.8 billion, according to Forbes. The move could be an indication that McMahon, 78, plans to get out of his family business, which has been the dominant player in professional wrestling for about four decades, launching the careers of Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, John Cena and many other crossover stars. Earlier this year, WWE merged with UFC to form TKO, which is majority owned by Endeavor Group, the talent agency and media company run by Ari Emanuel. McMahon is executive chairman of TKO. In August, WWE said he was served with a federal grand jury subpoena related to allegations that he paid millions of dollars in hush money to women who accused him of sexual misconduct. He said at the time he has \u201calways denied any intentional wrongdoing and continue to do so.\u201d He also went on medical leave in July after he had spinal surgery. Endeavor, meanwhile, is exploring strategic alternatives as its market value hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations since it went public in 2021. Endeavor\u2019s biggest shareholder, investment firm Silver Lake, said it could take the company private. ",

        "title": "Startup founder Charlie Javice to go to trial in 2024 over alleged JPMorgan fraud",
        "content": "Charlie Javice, who is accused of defrauding JPMorgan into buying her now-shuttered college financial aid company, Frank, will go to trial in October. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein set the 2024 trial date in an order filed in New York and said in the filing that prosecutors must require JPMorgan Chase to produce more evidence that could benefit Javice in her defense. Javice was indicted on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy in May. She pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges and is out on a $2 million bond.  Federal prosecutors alleged Javice \u201cfalsely and dramatically\u201d exaggerated the number of Frank customers to \u201cinduce\u201d JPMorgan to acquire Frank. Javice repeatedly said the company had more than 4 million customers, when it had only a few hundred thousand, according to prosecutors. The government said Javice fabricated the number by giving the bank a list of fake names and emails, court documents showed. Javice founded Frank in 2017, and JPMorgan acquired it in 2021. The bank also hired Javice and other Frank employees as part of the deal. Javice received more than $21 million for selling her equity stake in the startup and $20 million as a retention bonus, prosecutors said. In October, Javice said in a court filing that JPMorgan didn\u2019t produce \u201clikely thousands\u201d of documents, including its internal assessment of the Frank acquisition, its internal investigation of Frank and internal communications between JPMorgan employees. \u201cThe government\u2019s response has been deliberate inaction, making clear that although JPMC holds highly relevant, potentially exculpatory, readily available materials that are responsive to the government\u2019s subpoenas, the government does not intend to collect them,\u201d the filing said. Javice added that the \u201cgovernment seems content to rest its entire complaint (and theory of the case) on JPMC\u2019s cherry-picked set of documents.\u201d Federal prosecutors argued they obtained and turned over all documents relevant to the government and the defense, court documents showed. \u201cThe simple reality is that JPMC has been complying (like the dozens of other subpoena recipients in this case) with the government\u2019s subpoenas, and the government has been complying with its discovery obligations,\u201d prosecutors said. Still, in this week\u2019s order, Hellerstein, the judge, ruled that federal prosecutors should require JPMorgan Chase to \u201csearch for\u201d and \u201cproduce,\u201d under the existing subpoenas, emails and documents related to all JPMorgan officers or employees referred to in the complaint. Hellerstein said the government must seek and produce the documents by the end of next week. On Thursday, Javice\u2019s attorneys subpoenaed JPMorgan Chase to get additional documents and emails from specific employees beyond the ones referenced in the complaint, according to a court filing.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the bank\u2019s acquisition of Frank a \u201chuge mistake\u201d on a January conference call, Reuters reported. The bank shut Frank down in January. Prosecutors and the defense will be back in court for their next status conference in January. Chloe Atkins reports for the NBC News Investigative Unit, based in New York.

        "title": "Biden stresses support for unions and meets with UAW president after strike",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on Thursday emphasized his support for unions during a trip to Illinois and celebrated the reopening of a Stellantis plant after tentative deals were recently struck between the United Auto Workers and three major U.S. automakers following a strike that lasted weeks. Biden also met with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, as well as union members in his visit to the city of Belvidere, northwest of Chicago. \"I want to thank you for your commitment to the solidarity, for exercising your right to bargain collectively,\" Biden said in remarks delivered to an audience of union members. \"You made this happen.\" The president told the crowd that they are changing \"the face of the country economically\" with their efforts. The plant's planned reopening will help highlight Biden's commitment to \"rehiring and retooling the EV and EV battery jobs in the same communities where auto jobs have created good-paying union jobs for decades,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday, ahead of the president's trip. The plant had been idled early this year. The UAW struck a tentative agreement with General Motors late last month, days after making similar breakthroughs with Ford and Stellantis. The White House and Fain have touted the Stellantis plant's planned reopening as the result of the tentative agreement between the UAW and the company, which owns Chrysler. The White House has said that the factory's reopening would bring back \u201cmore than all of the 1,200 jobs lost, and at higher wages.\u201d The company is also adding about 1,000 new union jobs because Stellantis is investing in new battery manufacturing, the White House said. Biden frequently highlights unions in his economy speeches, claiming he is the \u201cmost pro-union president\u201d in history. He visited a UAW picket line in Michigan early in the autoworkers\u2019 strike, becoming the first sitting president to do so. \u201cYou saved the automobile industry back in 2008 and before,\u201d Biden said in remarks on the picket line in September. \u201cYou made a lot of sacrifices. You gave up a lot, and the companies were in trouble. But now they\u2019re doing incredibly well. And guess what? You should be doing incredibly well too.\u201d Ahead of his remarks on Thursday, a local union leader gave Biden a T-shirt from the union chapter, which he wore during his speech. \"That shirt looks good on you,\" an audience member yelled during the program. Biden's remarks were briefly interrupted at the beginning by a protester who shouted for him to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The crowd booed the interruption while Biden tried to quell the tension, saying: \"Let her go ... it's OK.\" The UAW strike started in mid-September as union members worked to negotiate contracts with the three big automakers. The union was ultimately able to negotiate contracts that would provide union members with increased pay and reinstate cost-of-living adjustments, among other benefits. \"My administration will keep working to make sure UAW has what it needs to outcompete China and everyone else in the world. I've reminded other world leaders it's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America,\" Biden said during his remarks. Biden also took a shot at former president Donald Trump during his speech, mentioning him by name which he often refrains from doing in remarks to the public. \"Is there ever anything America set its mind to as a nation that we\u2019ve done together and we haven\u2019t succeeded?\" Biden said. \"Well, you know, Donald Trump often says, 'We\u2019re now a failing nation. We\u2019re a nation in decline.'\" The audience booed in response, with one person shouting, \"put him in jail!\" Following the event, Fain called Biden's visit \"a great day.\" But despite the praise, the UAW has not endorsed Biden's re-election bid. The union endorsed him in 2020. \"Our primary focus right now is just getting the contracts ratified,\" Fain told NBC News. \"You know, getting the membership, the information they need to make a decision.\" He added that there will be a time for making endorsements. Biden's remarks come just a day after a tentative agreement was also reached between the actors union SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, potentially ending a monthslong actors strike that along with a writers strike, ground Hollywood to a halt. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is a trade group that bargains for studio and streaming services and represents Comcast, which owns NBC News. \u201cWhen both sides come to the table to negotiate in earnest, they can make businesses stronger and allow workers to secure pay and benefits that help them raise families and retire with dignity,\u201d Biden said in a statement celebrating the tentative agreement.

        "title": "LGBTQ youth suicide prevention group leaves X after uptick in 'hate & vitriol'",
        "content": "The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, announced it is leaving X, formerly known as Twitter, because of \u201cincreasing hate & vitriol on the platform targeting the LGBTQ community.\u201d The decision comes just over a year after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finalized his $44 billion purchase of the company. \u201cLGBTQ young people are regularly victimized at the expense of their mental health, and X\u2019s removal of certain moderation functions makes it more difficult for us to create a welcoming space for them on this platform,\u201d the organization wrote in a tweet Thursday. The Trevor Project, which has nearly 350,000 followers on X, said the decision to leave was made with \u201cinput from dozens of internal and external perspectives.\u201d In particular, the group wrote, \u201cwe questioned whether leaving the platform would allow harmful narratives and rhetoric to prevail with one less voice to challenge them.\u201d But in the end, the group decided that leaving was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d At the end of its message, the organization directed LGBTQ young people to TrevorSpace.org, its own social networking space for queer teens and young adults. The Trevor Project also noted that it will continue to maintain its presence on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn and Facebook. X\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on The Trevor Project\u2019s departure or its characterization of \u201chate & vitriol\u201d on the platform. As NBC News reported last month on the one-year anniversary of Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, many LGBTQ people say the once-hospitable home for community building has turned toxic. This, they say, is due in part to a number of policy changes and business decisions at the company, including the layoff of employees who worked on reducing misinformation and harassment on the platform, and the removal of the site\u2019s previous ban on intentionally using the incorrect pronouns or names for transgender people, practices known as misgendering and deadnaming. GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy group, releases an annual Social Media Safety Index and Platform Scorecard that evaluates social media platforms\u2019 policies for ensuring the safety of LGBTQ users. In its most recent scorecard, published in June, X ranked in last place among the major social media platforms. Since Musk took over the platform, LGBTQ people running some of the most-followed X accounts have abandoned it. Elton John, who has over a million followers, announced he was leaving in December, and Ellen DeGeneres, who has 75 million followers, hasn\u2019t tweeted since April. And The Trevor Project is not the only LGBTQ nonprofit to leave. The San Francisco LGBT Center, LGBTQ Youth Scotland and the U.K.-based Mermaids, a transgender charity, have also left the platform, just to name a few.

        "title": "The strikes in Hollywood are ending. Here's what that means for you.",
        "content": "It\u2019s a new day in Hollywood. Six months after the first of two strikes brought the entertainment capital to a grinding halt, the industry is finally ready to spring back to life. SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 screen actors who have been on the picket lines since July, reached a tentative contract agreement Wednesday with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a trade group that represents the leading studios and streamers. (The organization bargains on behalf of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)  The deal, which still needs to be approved by the union\u2019s board, would revive a business that has been paralyzed since May, when Writers Guild of America members announced they were going on strike for the first time in 16 years. Los Angeles, New York and other media hubs will be on steadier economic footing, and rank-and-file entertainment workers can breathe a sigh of relief. The end of the strife is also good news for audiences who might have noticed some changes to their entertainment diet recently, such as an unusually light fall television lineup. In the coming months, assuming the contract agreement holds, viewers around the world may start to see the fruits of Hollywood\u2019s labor once again. Here\u2019s what to expect: When tens of thousands of actors headed to the picket lines July 14, production on a slate of high-profile film projects such as Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator 2\u201d and the eighth installment in the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise went dark. If the SAG-AFTRA contract is approved as expected, cameras could start rolling again before year\u2019s end, though details need to be ironed out. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on getting our productions up and running soon,\u201d an industry source said, adding that there was no \u201cdefinite answer on exactly when, considering a lot of logistics go into it.\u201d Meanwhile, small-screen favorites such as NBC\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d might get back on track in short order, partly because writers have been cleared to crank out new episodic scripts for more than six weeks and the creation of TV shows tends to move more quickly than filmmaking. \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d creator and star Quinta Brunson was flooded with questions on X overnight, with users demanding to know when the third season of the Emmy-winning ABC sitcom will return. When asked whether \u201cAbbott\u201d would start filming soon, Brunson replied with a one-second clip of social media personality Tokyo Toni saying: \u201cWell, yes!\u201d SAG-AFTRA rules prohibited members from promoting movies and TV shows in any way during the strike, which meant that actors went 118 days without plugging their work on late-night comedy shows, TikTok and Instagram, where young stars like Zendaya (featured in the postponed movies \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and \u201cChallengers\u201d) have large followings. The end of the actors strike will almost certainly open up the floodgates on celebrity self-promotion. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet can tout the December debut of \u201cWonka\u201d when he hosts NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this weekend; Oscar hopefuls Bradley Cooper (\u201cMaestro\u201d), Emma Stone (\u201cPoor Things\u201d), and Jeffrey Wright (\u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d) can hit the talk show circuit. Michelle Buteau, the star and co-creator of the Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest,\u201d didn\u2019t get much of a chance to promote the series because it premiered just a day before the actors strike started. In tweets Thursday, Buteau and co-star Garcelle Beauvais acknowledged the show for seemingly the first time. Albert Brooks, the legendary comedian and actor who is the subject of a new HBO documentary, captured the mood in a tweet just minutes after news of the SAG-AFTRA deal broke: \u201cThe SAG strike is over!! I can finally say it: watch my documentary Saturday night at 8 on HBO/MAX! I can\u2019t wait for you to see it! Couldn\u2019t say a word until now!!\u201d The increasingly shaky economics of streaming businesses mean that many studios are likely to cut back on content spending in the coming year, but there will still be a lot of new scripts, deals and rumors flying around the entertainment world \u2014 including announcements about actors landing roles in buzzy projects. \u201cThe casting news that we\u2019re gonna get in the next couple weeks before Thanksgiving in the U.S. is gonna be biblical,\u201d Johnny Sobczak, a film critic and writer, tweeted Wednesday night. He noted that news could soon drop about the on-screen talent lined up for the third season of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and Marvel\u2019s reboot of the \u201cFantastic Four\u201d franchise, for example. In tweets, some workaday actors are already posting headshots as they try to book work. \u201cCC: casting,\u201d one actor said in a photo caption. Meanwhile, studios are expected to put a fleet of new movies and shows into development as they try to make up for lost time. The show must go on, after all.

        "content": "The unions representing hospitality workers in Las Vegas on Thursday reached a tentative deal with MGM Resorts International for a new contract covering nearly 25,400 employees, less than 24 hours before a strike threatened to shut down the Strip. The Culinary Workers and Bartenders Unions said they have a five-year tentative agreement with the casino operator, which averts a strike at eight MGM properties and comes a day after rival Caesars Entertainment reached a deal with 10,000 workers. MGM Resorts, the biggest Las Vegas operator by number of employees, said on Wednesday that the new contract would result in the largest pay increase in the history of its contracts with the unions. MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of MGM were up 1.78% in morning trading. The negotiations, which began in April, came as a number of unions across industries press employers for better pay and benefits, buoyed by a shortage of workers. The Las Vegas unions, considered among the most powerful in the United States, were demanding meaningful wage increases, funds for healthcare and pensions as well as a reduction in steep housekeeping quotas and mandating of daily room cleaning. Caesars Entertainment, the second-biggest Las Vegas casino operator by number of employees, said that its deal with the unions provides \u201cmeaningful wage increases\u201d and aligns with plans to bring more union jobs to the Strip. Wynn Resorts has yet to yield an agreement ahead of Friday\u2019s strike deadline but said it has negotiations scheduled with the unions on Thursday. Casino resort operators have been earning record profits from a steady post-pandemic recovery in Las Vegas tourism. Visits to the city in September were 4% lower than in the same period in 2019, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Room rates, however, have surged more than 47%.

        "content": "United Airlines plans to make it easier for customers to earn elite status through co-branded Chase credit cards, the latest airline to tweak its lucrative frequent flyer program to reward big spenders. The airline isn\u2019t changing overall requirements for elite frequent flyer status next year, a first for the carrier since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, United said Thursday that in 2024, it will reward customers with 25 qualifying points for every $500 they spend on co-branded cards. Currently, customers get 500 points for every $12,000 spent. The carrier will also lift caps on credit card spending that can qualify toward elite status. Travelers need 5,000 qualifying points plus four flights to get to silver status, the lowest level, or have a combination of flights and points. Airlines reward their elites with perks such as free upgrades, when available; earlier boarding; and other perks. But ranks of elite frequent flyers have surged in recent years as travelers continued to spend during the Covid-19 pandemic and airlines allowed them to hold on to their tier status even if they weren\u2019t flying. That has challenged airlines to keep their programs both exclusive and reasonably attainable and angered elites who are jostling alongside fellow travelers for upgrades or airport lounge access. Delta Air Lines in September said elite status would be awarded solely on spend \u2014 instead of a combination of flights and spending \u2014 though last month it walked back some planned changes to its SkyMiles program and lounge access limits after customer complaints.

        "title": "'The Marvels' is headed for one of the worst MCU box office openings ever",
        "content": "It was always going to be tough to top \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d but what has spilled out from Disney and Marvel Studios in the wake of that epic has left fans discouraged about the franchise. There was hope that \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which arrives in theaters Friday, might build on the box office success of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3\u2033 earlier this year. But there\u2019s a strong chance it could have one of the lowest opening weekends in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Initial predictions saw the film opening to between $75 million and $80 million domestically, but those figures have shrunk to a range between $60 million and $65 million in recent weeks. No MCU film has opened in that range since 2011, according to data from Comscore. The only films that have opened lower than $60 million have been 2015\u2032s \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d which debuted with $57 million in 2015, and 2008\u2032s \u201cIncredible Hulk,\u201d which opened with $55 million. \u201cThe Marvel track record at the box office is virtually unrivaled in terms of the depth and breadth of titles, the staggering number of records broken, fan appreciation and sheer revenue generating power over the decades,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cUnfortunately, countless spinoffs, sequels and universes in both big screen and small screen iterations, and an at times unclear marketing message have resulted in mixed critical and fan reaction and thus resulted in disappointing box office results for some of Marvel\u2019s recent big screen offerings,\u201d he added. While it\u2019s clear that Marvel has lost out on actor promotion for the film due to the SAG-AFTRA strike (which finally has an apparent resolution), there are many other factors behind the soft expectations for \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d For one, \u201cEndgame\u201d marked the culmination of nearly a decade of interconnected storytelling and overperformed expectations. It wrapped up a number of character storylines and opened the door for new adventures. However, in Disney\u2019s exuberance to pad its fledgling streaming service Disney+ during the pandemic, it saturated the market with hit-or-miss television series. It introduced dozens of new heroes and villains as well as fundamentally altered the universe in which previous films had been set. For many casual fans, the inundation of content began to feel more like homework than entertainment. Additionally, the content itself, both on the big and small screen, hasn\u2019t been up to par for audiences. While shows like \u201cLoki,\u201d \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d and \u201cMoon Knight\u201d scored well with critics and general viewers, \u201cSecret Invasion\u201d flopped. Similarly, on the theatrical side, \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d \u201cGuardians 3\u2033 and \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d won over audiences, while \u201cThe Eternals,\u201d \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d and \u201cThor: Love and Thunder\u201d made them question the direction of the franchise. So far, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d has a soft score on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics particularly ripped the film\u2019s script, calling it \u201cpaper thin,\u201d \u201ccharmless\u201d and \u201cpandering in all the wrong places.\u201d Yet, Iman Vellani, who portrays the plucky, newly minted superhero Ms. Marvel, seems to be a bright spot in the feature, with many critics praising her performance. Box office analysts aren\u2019t ready to wave the white flag on superhero content, suggesting that audiences aren\u2019t lukewarm on superheroes, they are just sick of bad stories. After all, look at the success of Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThe Boys\u201d and \u201cGen V,\u201d as well as the animated series \u201cInvincible.\u201d There\u2019s also Max\u2019s \u201cPeacemaker.\u201d \u201cThis is not a fatigue of Marvel or superheroes, but a fatigue of creative and studio missteps that are not unique to any one film or franchise,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \u201cIt just so happens that because it\u2019s Marvel, everything is more magnified and scrutinized whether things are going right or wrong.\u201d Box office analysts have pointed to Marvel\u2019s film promotion as another issue for the studio. When \u201cThe Marvels\u201d was first teased to audiences it was billed as a female-led comedy, with its heroines swapping powers at random while they learn how to become a team. In its most recent trailer release, Marvel sets \u201cThe Marvels\u201d up as a generic action movie in which the villain is destroying the fabric of the universe with a magical MacGuffin. The trailer also features a significant number of shots from previous Marvel movies featuring characters like Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Steve Rogers (Captain America), who are no longer part of the franchise. \u201cThe fact that marketing spots for this particular movie are leaning on nostalgia and clips from \u2018Endgame\u2019 represents a red flag in and of itself,\u201d Robbins said. In the past, deceptive marketing was part of the appeal of Marvel\u2019s trailers. Altered footage or purposefully edited clips and shots were done to conceal spoilers or entice fans. For example, in trailers for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d clips that show Thanos\u2019 gauntlet featured fewer infinity stones as to not spoil that he had collected more during the film. The stark contrast in how \u201cThe Marvels\u201d was first advertised versus its final trailer suggests that Disney was worried about lackluster presales and wanted to lure in fans with hints of nostalgia to previous projects. If \u201cThe Marvels\u201d does flop at the box office, it could push Disney to more aggressively look for a reset. Especially, since it\u2019s already facing an uphill battle with actor Jonathan Majors, who it chose to take on the role of Kang, the next big bad in the MCU. Majors is embroiled in legal troubles stemming from allegations of assault and abuse. \u201cAt the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,\u201d CEO Bob Iger said during Disney\u2019s earnings call Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality, and I think that\u2019s exactly what happened. We lost some focus.\u201d Iger said that the company is looking to consolidate the number of films it makes going forward and focus more on quality. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any easy answers for the big picture state of Marvel\u2019s challenges right now, but if there\u2019s an upside it\u2019s that plenty of moviegoers and fans do still care,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThey want to see a course correction sooner rather than later.\u201d There\u2019s still some good news at least, said Comscore\u2019s Dergarabedian. \u201cThe Marvels\u201d isn\u2019t competing against \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d which left the calendar in favor of a 2024 release, and will have plenty of premium movie screens to play in. Those showings, which typically cost more than traditional screenings, could pad the film\u2019s box office. \u201cIt would be wise to temper opening weekend expectations given the uneven performances of some of the recent releases from the brand and look more at the ultimate box office result as the true measure of success for this latest Marvel release,\u201d he said.

        "title": "GM's Cruise recalls 950 robotaxis after pedestrian collision",
        "content": "Cruise, the autonomous vehicle venture owned by General Motors, has issued a recall effecting 950 of its robotaxis following a pedestrian collision in San Francisco last month. Previously, the company had grounded all of its driverless operations following the Oct. 2 collision during which a pedestrian was thrown into the path of the Cruise robotaxi by a human driver in a different car who hit her first. The Cruise autonomous vehicle braked aggressively before impact and then tried to pull over to the side of the road, according to the NHTSA filing and prior statements from the company. In the process, the vehicle dragged the pedestrian forward about 20 feet.  The Oct. 2 collision triggered a federal probe. And the collision, along with Cruise\u2019s disclosures around it, led to California regulators stripping the company of its permits to operate driverless vehicles in the state, unless there is a human safety driver aboard. Rival Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet, continues to operate driverless fleets in and beyond California. According to the Cruise filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Nov. 7, following the collision, Cruise found defects within its automated driving system software, specifically pertaining to its \u201cCollision Detection Subsystem.\u201d Cruise wrote in the filing to the federal vehicle safety agency: \u201cIn certain circumstances, a collision may occur, after which the Collision Detection Subsystem may cause the Cruise AV to attempt to pull over out of traffic instead of remaining stationary when a pullover is not the desired post-collision response. This issue could occur after a collision with a pedestrian positioned low on the ground in the path of the AV.\u201d In a separate blog post on Wednesday, Cruise said that besides implementing the voluntary recall, the company is now conducting a search to hire a Chief Safety Officer. Louise Zhang, VP of Safety & Systems at Cruise, is serving as Interim Chief Safety Officer, overseeing the company\u2019s safety reviews and investigations per the company statement. Cruise has initiated third-party reviews of the Oct. 2 incident relying on a law firm well-known for its work on behalf of Tesla and Elon Musk, Quinn Emanuel, alongside engineering consultants Exponent. After Cruise lost its permits in California, and faced a public backlash over safety concerns, the company also temporarily suspended production of its Cruise Origin driverless vans. Cruise and GM had planned to produce a low volume of these autonomous shuttles in Detroit. Unveiled in 2020, the Origin has no steering wheel or acceleration pedal, and seats six passengers. GM said last month that the company has lost roughly $1.9 billion on Cruise from January through September this year, including $732 million in the third quarter alone. ",

        "title": "Thousands of schools are turning to apps to fight bullying and violence. Do they work?",
        "content": "Mass shootings, bullying, student mental health and the threat of gun violence have become increasingly bigger concerns at U.S. schools during the last two decades. In the wake of the pandemic, which was both deeply damaging to students and forced many schools to employ new technology to teach students, more schools are turning to apps to address those problems. \u201cTechnology companies during the pandemic really took a rise of presenting themselves as an app-based solution for problems in schools,\u201d said Alexis Hancock of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. That\u2019s perhaps expected \u2014 who doesn\u2019t love high-tech solutions to everything? \u2014 and surprising, in that thousands of schools are telling students and parents to download and use these apps. The notion of apps to address problems ranging from cyberbullying to mental health crises to shootings isn\u2019t new. And Corporate America is exploring this path, too. But inside the tech departments at various schools, things seem to be taking off. Craig Hansen said he recognized during the pandemic that students were struggling more than ever. Along with experiencing the trauma of the pandemic, they were suffering from a long period of isolation from their peers and had been deprived of a lot of their normal activities. And they still had the normal pressures of school to contend with. So he wanted to find a way to help. Hansen is the chief emergency officer for Questar III BOCES, a school that also provides educational and administrative services to districts in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley. \u201cWe knew it would be a good opportunity to try to get a grant to help support our schools in this realm knowing the mental health strains and stressors that we were seeing,\u201d he told NBC News. Companies including STOPit Solutions, Raptor Technologies, Navigate360, Anonymous Alerts, and Sandy Hook Promise offer apps with a wide variety of safety and monitoring features such as anonymous threat reporting, tracking of visitors to schools, silent alarms and communication with police and mental health counselors. Several states have developed their own reporting systems with similar features. The companies say they are giving schools and students tools that can prevent a tragedy. What\u2019s certain is that they\u2019re becoming widespread. Hansen said he applied for a Justice Department grant and received funding to pay for a program that would help address the problems students were having. He considered a handful of options and chose STOPit Solutions because it has a 24-hour monitoring center where reports are evaluated. Fifteen area school districts joined his application, which was ultimately accepted. They are now starting to use the system. \u201cIt\u2019s another tool that will allow students and families to report something and give kids the help that they need,\u201d he told NBC News. STOPit Solutions, a privately-held company that has been around since 2013, says its app is now being used by 8,800 schools in every U.S. state. \u201cWe give kids a simple fast and powerful way to reach out when they\u2019re in distress, and that can be an external threat, a threat on campus, or an internal threat to oneself, which is more commonly the case these days,\u201d CEO C. Parkhill Mays III said. Mays says the company gets 300 to 500 reports from students every night, and about 10.5% of those constitute an imminent threat in which police or mental health professionals are brought in. When it comes to the nightmare scenario of school shootings, unspoken in all of this is the following: Parents and school administrators can\u2019t do much about U.S. gun policies or the state of the health care system in the immediate future, and both of those are both often cited as factors in these issues. But many school officials say they have to do something. And in many cases, they\u2019re required to act. A handful of states around the country have passed versions of Alyssa\u2019s Law, which require schools to have silent panic alarms in case of an emergency. Craig Hansen said he sought the grant that funded the STOPit app in the Hudson schools because New York state was about to pass that law. In that context, something like an app that could report a dangerous situation or person looks that much more helpful. Still, experts said, apps like these could be a double-edged sword. While they could really help students going through a crisis, they have to be implemented carefully \u2014 particularly when it comes to potential school violence. They raised concerns about whether students would use these reporting tools to harass their peers, for example. Mays said that kind of behavior is rare, as less than 1% of reports that go through his company\u2019s app are a result of users abusing the platform. He added that school administrators can block students who misuse the app. Hancock, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that before a school partners with a reporting app like these, it needs to create procedures that will dictate how different kinds of reports will be handled, what kinds of in-person interventions are done, and when parents or authorities are contacted, among other things. Without that, she says, even a well-designed app won\u2019t do much good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an outlined offline protocol, this tool will be effectively useless,\u201d Hancock said. The experts NBC News spoke to agreed that children who seem suicidal require immediate help, and that an app where students can report that they or their peers are struggling has obvious benefits \u2014 and that counselors and regular screenings and check-ins are needed, as well. Devorah Heitner, author of \u201cGrowing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World,\u201d said that giving schools more resources to address students\u2019 mental health problems would help more than an app. She said there have been plenty of cases where students have reported that they were worried that a fellow student was going to bring a gun to school \u2014 only for no one to act on that report, with tragic results. In some cases, she added, future school shooters have even reported themselves but not received help. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be doing schoolwide mental health screenings on kids and then taking seriously what kids say about how they\u2019re doing,\u201d Heitner said. \u201cI think we need more counselors than cops in schools.\u201d In its introductory materials, STOPit Solutions tells students that they have to take it upon themselves to get involved and report behavior that might be a warning sign for violence, such as unusual and concerning actions or statements. \u201cEighty percent of mass shootings are preventable due to the presence of early warning threat indicators,\u201d STOPit national trainer Martoinne Williams says in a student training video. He says it\u2019s especially important for students to monitor social media for those signs. \u201cAdults are not spending that much time on social media, so that means you are the eyes and the ears on social media,\u201d he says. He advises them to take screenshots and gather specific information about the time and place that any violent incident might occur, and report it to schools through the app. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking children to be their own private investigators to bullying campaigns, and that\u2019s not an approach I would want any child to take,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cIf we were actually to address this, it has to be through a multifaceted solution, not a singular app asking students to become police.\u201d Austin Crosier, Hudson City School District communications specialist, said that for his district, STOPit is part of a broader emphasis on health and safety. \u201cWe have and always will encourage students and staff if they see/hear something concerning or are dealing with an issue, to say something and get ahead of the situation before it escalates. All administrators, guidance counselors, building psychologists, nurses and staff are willing and ready to assist however they can and will treat every case individually with the utmost care and importance,\u201d he wrote in an email to NBC News. Still, experts who spoke to NBC News said there were downsides to the idea of addressing bullying through reports and apps. The idea of getting bystanders to intervene in bullying situations has become a popular one, said Izzy Kalman, a school psychiatrist and author. But he says there is little evidence showing that it helps. Kalman told NBC News that since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, schools have taken overly active approaches to stamping out bullying, including asking students to report all manner of incidents. In his view, it doesn\u2019t work, and might be making things worse. He points out that there is nothing more upsetting to a child than being \u201ctold on,\u201d so getting administrators involved becomes part of a cycle of punishment and revenge. \u201cPeople get defensive when reported,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get back and it escalates and it leads to physical harm.\u201d There are unquestionably times when children need to get an authority figure involved, Kalman says. Especially if someone is hurt or a crime is committed, or someone is in danger. But in other situations, he says, schools should be teaching children how to solve their own problems and develop relationships instead of telling them to report one another to authority figures. Juliette Pennyman, superintendent of the Hudson City School District, which started using STOPit on Nov. 1, had a different perspective. She said that using the app to report potential problems will ultimately make students feel more connected. \u201cI think it will help the culture of transparency and wanting to keep everyone safe, and students caring about each other, and they know that they won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re telling on a friend if a friend is in distress of any kind,\u201d she said.

        "content": "Family grocery bills have been on the rise with higher prices for some items, such as ground beef, and lower prices for others, such as eggs. But unless shoppers are taking notes, it can be hard to really see which items are seeing the biggest spikes. NBC News is monitoring the average point-of-sale prices and how much those prices have changed since October 2022 for six popular supermarket items: orange juice, eggs, chicken breasts, fresh ground beef, bacon and bread. Readers can use this interactive chart to see how the price they have paid for groceries differs from the national average or from the prices shoppers paid in other major metro areas.  The goal is to track the impact of inflation on consumers\u2019 wallets during the pandemic and as the economy reopens. The White House has said inflation is on the rise and here to stay. The NBC News grocery price tracker is one measure of the outcomes of President Joe Biden's economic policies for everyday people. The Federal Reserve has said that prices have accelerated and that they are expected to keep rising. Input costs are up, especially for food and fuel, which pressures grocery prices. Supply chain disruptions and weather also play roles. The data in the NBC News tracker, provided by NIQ, formerly NielsenIQ, is collected from real checkout prices paid nationwide at grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, selected dollar stores, selected warehouse clubs and military commissaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly consumer price index, which uses human data collectors and includes other food product categories, is another resource for average price data.

        "title": "Credit card balances spiked in the third quarter to a record $1.08 trillion. Here's how we got here.",
        "content": "Americans now owe $1.08 trillion on their credit cards, according to a new report on household debt from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit card balances spiked by $154 billion year over year, notching the largest increase since 1999, the New York Fed found. \u201cCredit card balances experienced a large jump in the third quarter, consistent with strong consumer spending and real GDP growth,\u201d said Donghoon Lee, the New York Fed\u2019s economic research advisor. Credit card delinquency rates also rose across the board, according to the New York Fed, but especially among millennials, or borrowers between the ages of 30 and 39, who are burdened by high levels of student loan debt. With most people feeling strained by higher prices \u2014 particularly for food, gas and housing \u2014 more cardholders are carrying debt from month to month or falling behind on payments, and a greater percentage of balances are going more than 180 days delinquent, according to a separate report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Nearly one-tenth of credit card users find themselves in \u201cpersistent debt\u201d where they are charged more in interest and fees each year than they pay toward the principal \u2014 a pattern that is increasingly difficult to break, the consumer watchdog said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. \u201cYour credit card is probably your highest cost debt by a wide margin.\u201d Credit card rates were already high but have recently spiked along with the Federal Reserve\u2019s string of 11 rate hikes, including four in 2023. Since most credit cards have a variable rate, there\u2019s a direct connection to the Fed\u2019s benchmark. As the federal funds rate rose, the prime rate did, as well, and credit card rates followed suit. The average annual percentage rate is now more than 20% \u2014 also an all-time high. Despite the steep cost, consumers often turn to credit cards, in part because they are more accessible than other types of loans, according to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. But that comes at the expense of other long-term financial goals, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s money that doesn\u2019t go to a college fund or down payment on a home purchase or Roth IRA,\u201d he said. Up until recently, most Americans benefited from a few government-supplied safety nets, most notably the large injection of stimulus money, which left many households sitting on a stockpile of cash that enabled some cardholders to keep their credit card balances in check. But that cash reserve is largely gone after consumers gradually spent down their excess savings from the Covid-19 pandemic years. Now, \u201cconsumers are maintaining and supporting their lifestyles using credit card debt,\u201d said Howard Dvorkin, a certified public accountant and the chairman of Debt.com. \u201cIt has been a struggle,\u201d said Adriana Cubillo, 25, of Modesto, California. \u201cMy rent is going up, so even though all my bills are paid, sometimes I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d Still, consumer credit scores have remained high, helped by a strong labor market and cooling inflation, along with the removal of certain medical collections data from consumer credit files, recent reports show. If you\u2019re carrying a balance, try calling your card issuer to ask for a lower rate, consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a lower interest home equity loan or personal loan or switch to an interest-free balance transfer credit card, Schulz advised. To optimize the benefits of their credit card, consumers should regularly compare credit card offers, pay as much of their balance as they can as soon as they can and avoid paying their bill late, said Mike Townsend, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association. \u201cAny credit card holder who finds themselves in financial stress should always contact their card issuer to make them aware of their situation,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThey may be eligible for some relief or assistance depending on their individual circumstances.\u201d Jessica Dickler is a personal finance writer for CNBC.

        "title": "WeWork, the office-sharing company once valued at $47B, files for bankruptcy protection",
        "content": "Office-sharing company WeWork filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey federal court Monday, saying that it had entered into agreements with the vast majority of its secured note holders and that it intended to trim \u201cnon-operational\u201d leases. The bankruptcy filing is limited to WeWork\u2019s locations in the U.S. and Canada, the company said in a news release. The company reported liabilities ranging from $10 billion to $50 billion, according to a bankruptcy filing. \u201cI am deeply grateful for the support of our financial stakeholders as we work together to strengthen our capital structure and expedite this process through the Restructuring Support Agreement,\u201d WeWork CEO David Tolley said in a press release. \u201cWe remain committed to investing in our products, services, and world-class team of employees to support our community. WeWork has suffered one of the most spectacular corporate collapses in recent U.S. history over the past few years. Valued in 2019 at $47 billion in a round led by Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, the company tried and failed to go public five years ago. The pandemic caused further pain as many companies abruptly ended their leases, and the economic slump that followed led even more clients to close their doors. It disclosed in an August regulatory filing that bankruptcy could be a concern. WeWork debuted through a special purpose acquisition company in 2021 but has since lost about 98% of its value. The company in mid-August announced a 1-for-40 reverse stock split to get its shares trading back above $1, a requirement for keeping its New York Stock Exchange listing. WeWork shares had fallen to a low of about 10 cents and were trading at about 83 cents before the stock was halted Monday. Former CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann said that the filing was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d \u201cIt has been challenging for me to watch from the sidelines since 2019 as WeWork has failed to take advantage of a product that is more relevant today than ever before,\u201d Neumann said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cI believe that, with the right strategy and team, a reorganization will enable WeWork to emerge successfully.\u201d As recently as September, the company said it had been actively renegotiating leases and that it was \u201chere to stay.\u201d The company had close to $16 billion in long-term lease obligations, according to securities filings. The company leases millions of square feet of office space in 777 locations around the world, according to its regulatory filings.

        "title": "Feud over power at Colorado cannabis farm heats up",
        "content": "An aspiring recreational marijuana grower who bought land at one of the largest commercial cannabis operations in the country is fighting to keep his pot dream from going up in smoke. But the company that owns Area 420, a business park in southern Colorado that includes more than 70 cannabis-related enterprises, wants to foreclose on the property Terry Ferrari purchased in the small town of Moffat, about 180 miles south of Denver. Moffat enjoyed its 15 minutes of fame last year when Area 420's parent company, Potch LLC, unsuccessfully tried to get the town of 100 residents to change its name to something it thought would better reflect the region's offerings: Kush. Kush is a strain of indica, a subspecies of the cannabis plant that typically contains a high level of THC, the main active ingredient in marijuana. As for the feud, Potch LLC claims Ferrari, through his Ridgeback Holdings LLC, owes at least $100,000 for two parcels he bought in 2021, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 29 in district court in Saguache County. He also owes thousands of dollars in interest payments, Potch alleges in the lawsuit. Ferrari said he bought the land in 2021 for $400,000, paying $200,000 upfront and planning to settle the balance after electricity was installed. But it never was. Ferrari said he believes that Potch is responsible for ensuring power is available on the property and that the lack thereof has dashed his hopes of making a fortune through marijuana cultivation more than a decade after Colorado became the first state to legalize it. Ferrari, who said he has spent nearly $2 million to build one of two planned marijuana facilities and fencing on his 4 acres, has refused to continue payments because, he says, he can\u2019t operate a cannabis farm without power. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at a big building that I can\u2019t use, and I\u2019m in a big heap of trouble, because they promised me power and couldn\u2019t give it to me,\u201d said Ferrari, who left his previous business flipping homes in Florida two years ago for the chance to work among other entrepreneurs at what Potch calls the largest marijuana-growing collective in the country. \u201cI put my life savings into this new venture,\u201d he said. The founder of Area 420, Mike Biggio, said Potch was never required to supply power to the property and insists the facts will come out in court. \u201cIt\u2019s up to each individual buyer to determine how much power they need, and then they have to pay for it. This is a power company issue, not a developer issue,\u201d Biggio said. \u201cI\u2019ve bent over backwards trying to work with him.\u201d Biggio pointed out there is some electricity on the property, but Ferrari said it's only enough to power the office lights and nowhere near what's required to keep grow lamps glowing night and day at a large-scale indoor marijuana farm. Potch began its southern Colorado venture five years ago when it bought 420 acres in a symbolic nod to April 20, the day marijuana is celebrated by aficionados around the world, and ensured its annexation by the city of Moffat. The business park is zoned for licensed commercial growers, manufacturers of marijuana-infused products, and laboratory, testing and research facilities for recreational and medical cannabis. Moffat Town Manager Cassandra Foxx said the park is the largest of its kind in the U.S., having generated about $400,000 in revenue for the municipality since its inception. The money helped pay to remodel a school and allowed the town to hire its lone police officer. The contract Potch and Ridgeback signed in 2021 says land costs and interest payments on the property would be due after electricity was installed, but it doesn't specify who is required to pay for the installation. Ferrari said he intentionally added that clause to the contract with the understanding that Potch would be responsible for installing electricity. But Potch argues in court documents that Ferrari knew power needed to be supplied through the local San Luis Valley Rural Electric Cooperative. \u201cRidgeback proceeded with purchasing the property knowing that there was no promise or guarantee of any electrical utility service at the property,\u201d he said in a court filing. Ridgeback had sufficient time to \"inspect and conduct due diligence investigations\u201d before it made the purchase, it added. In addition to his beef with Potch, Ferrari contends the electric company doesn\u2019t have the capacity to supply the amount of power his would-be farm needs. Eric Eriksen, the CEO of the San Luis Valley Rural Electric Cooperative, said the utility could supply it, but it would be costly. He declined to specify an amount. The price was \u201cmore than what they were anticipating,\u201d Eriksen said of Ridgeback Holdings. \u201cIt was quite a bit of money.\u201d Potch said in court records that the power demand on Ferrari's property, estimated at 3,000 amps, would exponentially exceed the electrical service of any other business in Area 420. Although it varies, most homes use 100 to 200 amps, short for amperage, the volume of electricity flowing through wires. \u201cHaving failed to do appropriate due diligence to determine the availability and costs of their electricity needs, Mr. Ferrari and Ridgeback now seek to blame Potch,\u201d the lawsuit says.

According to the complaint and a previous complaint filed in Oregon, Joseph Emerson, an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot, was allowed to travel in the cockpit\u2019s jump seat, a seat not normally allocated to paying passengers and sometimes reserved for pilots. The complaint and court documents allege that during the flight Emerson ripped off his earphones, told the cockpit he was \"not OK,\" then \"tried to crash the aircraft by activating the fire suppression system to shut down the fuel to the engines,\" leaving the plane seconds from becoming a glider. The pilots and Emerson \"then wrestled for seconds over control of the aircraft,\" the complaint said, before Emerson stopped and left the flight deck. The crew was able to restore the flow of fuel and the flight was diverted to Portland, Oregon. However, Emerson then tried to open an emergency exit door at the rear of the plane, only to be stopped by a flight attendant. A flight attendant reportedly told authorities she overheard Emerson say, \"I messed everything up\" and \"tried to kill everybody,\" court documents show. Emerson was charged with 83 counts of attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in October, and his attorney told NBC News his client \"would never intentionally hurt another person.\" A court document from October said that Emerson admitted he hadn't slept for 40 hours, he'd been suffering from depression, and had taken magic mushrooms two days before the flight. The three plaintiffs said they want a \"forthright public explanation\" on pre-flight security screenings from the airlines involved, which they say could prevent any future sabotage. \"The airlines need a wake-up call. We understand that most pilots are heroes every day for safely operating our airliners. But they are not immune from sleeplessness, drinking, drugs, or a mental health crisis,\" said Daniel Laurence, an aviation lawyer at The Stritmatter Firm, which represents the plaintiffs, in a statement. Laurence said that had proper checks been carried out, Emerson would not have been allowed aboard. \"Our clients suffered needlessly as a result. Only luck prevented it from becoming a mass disaster,\" he continued. Alaska Airlines said in an emailed statement: \"We have received the complaint and are reviewing it. The pilots and flight attendants operating Flight 2059 responded without hesitation to ensure the safety of all onboard. We are incredibly proud and grateful for their skilled actions.\" Patrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Tyson plant closures prompt economic soul-searching in the Ozarks",
        "content": "When Tyson Foods announced in August that it was closing its 1,500-worker chicken plant in Noel, Missouri, residents knew the rural town would be hit hard. Some started leaving soon after the company \u2014 which employed more than a quarter of the surrounding county \u2014 broke the news. The site shut down late last month, one of three October closures in a broader shake-up that the meat giant said reflected its \u201ccommitment to bold action and operational excellence.\u201d But Jimi Lasiter stayed put. After 11 years at the plant, she was holding out for her $1,000 severance check and assessing the exodus\u2019 impact on her community. By the end of September, she said around half a dozen colleagues had already left their tight-knit team of about 20; those who remained were packing office supplies and furniture rather than cuts of meat. She didn\u2019t want to create more work for them by leaving early, and she wasn\u2019t in a rush. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna go someplace else, especially if I\u2019m gonna get anything that pays more than $10 or $12 an hour, I\u2019m gonna have to drive 45 minutes,\u201d Lasiter said at the time. By Friday, though, she said she still hadn\u2019t received her severance, complicating her plans to file for unemployment benefits and take some time to weigh her options. Tyson didn\u2019t immediately comment on its compensation of former Noel employees. Like Lasiter, many workers are weighing their moves in a slowing national labor market. While hiring growth remains strong, people in rural areas without ample employment opportunities nearby are facing challenges that policymakers from the municipal to the federal levels say they\u2019re pushing to address. Data released Friday showed the economy added 150,000 jobs in October, down from 297,000 in September. Unemployment, while still at historic lows, ticked up to 3.9%. Last week President Joe Biden embarked on a tour of rural communities to highlight more than $5 billion in agricultural and small-town infrastructure investments aimed at spurring growth in places like Noel. Tyson and Noel officials have hosted job fairs for laid-off workers, and the company said more than 300 employees are relocating from closing facilities to its other sites. I\u2019ve talked to people that didn\u2019t relocate, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Let me know if something comes up there.\u2019 TYSON WORKER CORINA CHINCHILLA, WHO TOOK A JOB TRANSFER FROM NOEL TO MONETT, MO. Even as it\u2019s on pace to shut six plants this year and the next, triggering more than 4,600 job cuts, Tyson is developing two new ones in Danville, Virginia, and Bowling Green, Kentucky, set to employ 850 people altogether. \u201cMy first thought was: How can I stay with the company?\u201d said Corina Chinchilla, 32, who worked for 13 years at the Noel plant, ultimately becoming a production supervisor for packaging chicken breasts and tenders. She \u201capplied right away\u201d for a lateral move to Tyson\u2019s plant in Monett, Missouri, about 60 miles northeast of Noel but a similar 35-minute drive from her home in Neosho. All three towns, situated in the western Ozark Mountains, belong to a region where average annual income is $39,600 and 20% of jobs are in manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people that didn\u2019t relocate, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Let me know if something comes up there,\u2019\u201d Chinchilla said. Tyson confirmed that David Handy, a pallet jack operator at the Noel plant who spoke with NBC News in August about the closure, was among the 16% of the facility\u2019s workforce who took internal transfers. Handy didn\u2019t respond to recent requests for comment. Other Tyson workers, like Ryan Coulter, 27, declined to move. After working at the North Little Rock, Arkansas, plant that closed in early October, in roles that included assessing meat inventories, Coulter ruled out commuting to the nearest active Tyson complex. While the average price of a gallon of gas in Arkansas, at $3.03, is about 22 cents cheaper than it was a year ago, he\u2019d be driving much farther. \u201cI\u2019d end up spending half my check getting there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s stressful. I ain\u2019t gonna set myself up for failure.\u201d Instead, Coulter said, he took a job at a nearby Value Foods grocery store. He declined to say how the pay compares. While big employers like Amazon and Costco have expanded in the Little Rock metro area, attracting young professionals and a range of new jobs, Noel\u2019s economic future looks more uncertain. Mayor Terry Lance said he was working with the Harry S. Truman Coordinating Council, an economic development group in southwest Missouri, to find ways to move Noel beyond its longtime identity as a largely single-employer town. In the weeks after the plant closure was announced, he said he\u2019d talked with a pontoon boat manufacturer about taking it over, but that that company would employ no more than 350 workers at full capacity. Since then, Lance said a Texas firm that converts wastewater sludge to feedstock had signed a letter of intent to buy the complex, but he was \u201cnot convinced they can do that without a lot of odors\u201d and wanted to avoid a \u201cnightmare.\u201d I really do think we\u2019ll come back on the other side of it better. NOEL, MO., MAYOR TERRY LANCE Lance said other ideas included opening an \u201cindustrial training facility\u201d at the plant and pivoting Noel toward tourism, drawing on local attractions like the Elk River \u2014 Noel calls itself the \u201ccanoeing capital of the Ozarks\u201d \u2014 and the Bluff Dwellers Cave just outside town. He said he expects \u201ctwo years of really, really lean times\u201d but was confident the community would persevere. \u201cI want to urge all of our business owners to hold on, because I really do think we\u2019ll come back on the other side of it better,\u201d he said. Some of the town\u2019s character that Lance sees as an asset may already be waning. \u201cEveryone has their own unique art, craft, food and music, and that\u2019s what tourists like,\u201d he said of the robust immigrant communities drawn to Noel during its decades as a poultry hub. But as the Missouri Independent reported last week, many residents from Somalia and elsewhere who are in the United States under refugee programs have been quick to head out in search of new jobs, concerned about their employment prospects. State and federal officials, wary of economic fallout in the region, have pressed Tyson to sell some of the sites it\u2019s vacating. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey have both warned publicly that failing to seek new operators for the Noel plant and the one in Dexter that closed last month could violate antitrust laws. In September, Hawley said Tyson CEO Donnie King had reassured him that the company was willing to sell \u201cto any interested party \u2014 including a competitor.\u201d Tyson, which declined to comment on the future of its shuttered plants, has said it was \u201csupporting impacted team members and growers\u201d and was \u201copen to receiving all offers.\u201d J.J.

        "title": "As the price of these precious metals takes a hit, so too does a niche criminal enterprise",
        "content": "Thefts of catalytic converters surged so aggressively during the pandemic that Congress looked to step in. Now, new data indicates that the tidal wave of thefts is subsiding. Claims data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau shows that the average number of catalytic converters stolen each month is down significantly from its peak in 2022 through the first nine months of this year. Basic economics may be a factor.  Catalytic converters, an anti-pollution part installed under every car, are made of several metals \u2014 platinum, palladium and rhodium \u2014 that spiked in value from 2020 to 2022. The price of rhodium, for example, rose from approximately $3,000 an ounce in 2019 to nearly $26,000 two years later.   Rep. Jim Baird, R-Ind., noted that the metal prices were the \u201creal driver\u201d of the thefts, saying: \u201cas the price of those metals go up, [thieves] are more interested in them.\u201d But the business of converter theft has been squeezed from both sides in 2023. The prices of the precious metals have tumbled, with rhodium\u2019s price down to one-sixth of its 2021 peak. Simultaneously, rising scrutiny from law enforcement and new laws that create tougher penalties have increased the downside for those in the stolen converter trade.  In Pennsylvania\u2019s Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, investigators busted an $8.2 million catalytic converter theft ring in June. The effect on thefts in the area was immediate, Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub said.  \u201cSince we\u2019ve taken down [the ring], it\u2019s been reported to me that there\u2019s been a 50% decrease in catalytic converter thefts,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just taking down this one organization.\u201d At the federal level, the Justice Department announced a bust of a $545 million national catalytic converter crime ring in November 2022.  The bust involved FBI, IRS and Homeland Security agents operating in 10 states from California to Oklahoma to New Jersey.  \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially created a template showing what\u2019s possible,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cThat if you have the will and the cooperation of local, state, and federal government law enforcement, you can put these guys out of business.\u201d This year alone, 21 states have enacted laws aimed at combating thefts, according to the NICB, with 19 other states introducing similar legislation. And Baird introduced federal legislation in January that would require that converters be stamped with the ID number they came from, as well as codify thefts as a criminal offense. State and local governments have passed numerous laws since 2020. But until the metal prices fell, the effectiveness of these laws was mixed. Texas enacted a law requiring catalytic converter sellers provide a thumbprint and proof of purchase of the part. Despite the law, converter thefts in Texas reached new heights in 2022, NICB data showed. Reporting from NBC\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate attributes this to thieves skirting laws by stealing in Texas, but selling in other states with weaker laws.  It\u2019s the voices at the top of the \u201ccriminal food chain\u201d that trigger waves of catalytic converter thefts, Weintraub said. \u201cThese trends don\u2019t occur randomly \u2014 it\u2019s just economics: supply and demand.\u201d Jasmine Cui is a reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "What's next for Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX executives and investors",
        "content": "Former cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried faces the prospect of a long prison sentence, but that's not the end of the FTX legal saga. The FTX co-founder and ex-CEO was convicted of all seven fraud and money laundering charges against him on Thursday. He faces as much as 110 years in prison if Judge Lewis Kaplan gives him maximum sentences and consecutive terms. Bankman-Fried is scheduled to learn his sentence on March 28, 2024. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal the guilty verdicts against him at that time. He still faces another trial over other allegations including that he bribed Chinese officials. That trial is also scheduled to start in March. He's not the only one waiting to learn his fate. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former engineering chief Nishad Singh all pleaded guilty to a series of criminal charges and cooperated with the government's prosecution of Bankman-Fried. The three testified against him in the hope they would receive lighter sentences. They're likely to be sentenced after Bankman-Fried is. Chris LaVigne, the global co-chair of the digital asset group at international law firm Withersworldwide, said it's likely that all three will go to prison, as well. \"Given what they've admitted to, it isn\u2019t likely that they are going to end up with a non-incarceratory sentence,\" LaVigne, who is not involved in the case, told NBC News. Still, he said, their cooperation means the government will recommend that they receive a shorter sentence than what they would have received if they had been convicted after a trial. In determining the sentences that Wang, Ellison and Singh receive, Kaplan will consider factors including whether they intended to commit crimes, how helpful the government found their cooperation, whether they seem remorseful, and their potential for rehabilitation. Bankman-Fried was found responsible for taking some $8 billion from FTX's users without their consent and giving it to Alameda Research. The money was given to Alameda's lenders and was also used to pay for FTX corporate sponsorships, its Super Bowl ad and for enormous loans to corporate insiders, among other things. LaVigne, who is also the head of Withersworldwide\u2019s U.S. litigation team, said there are essentially two paths to returning funds to people who lost money to FTX, and to FTX's and Alameda's creditors. The first involves the U.S. government. As part of their guilty pleas, Wang, Ellison and Singh all agreed to forfeit proceeds from their time at FTX and Alameda. For example, Singh agreed to forfeit a multimillion-dollar home he\u2019d bought in Washington state and an investment in the AI company Anthropic PBC that was then worth $40 million. LaVigne said the government will probably set up a fund for FTX victims, get money the insiders received from FTX, auction off any ill-gotten assets, and return the proceeds to people who apply successfully to the victims fund. \"If there\u2019s billions in investments from a criminal and proceeds or money elsewhere, the government is going to get it,\" he said. Meanwhile, U.S. Trustee Andrew Vara will try to recoup money for victims through the bankruptcy process. \"That trustee and that estate is building a huge war chest to try to compensate creditors, which include customers of FTX,\" LaVigne said. Both of those processes can take a very long time to play out. The failure of FTX has often been compared to the infamous Ponzi scheme run by Bernie Madoff, which was exposed in December 2008. Trustee Irving Picard returned some $13 billion to victims over the course of a decade, while the U.S. government said it returned $4 billion to the Madoff Victim Fund. It announced the most recent payment to that fund in September 2022. \"These things go on for a long time and they find money wherever they can,\" LaVigne said. The government can also pursue any company or person it believes was complicit in the scheme. In the Madoff case, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay more than $2 billion in fines and penalties to settle allegations that it turned a blind eye to Madoff's actions for more than a decade.

        "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concert film takes its final bow at the box office this weekend",
        "content": "Taylor Swift takes her final bow at the movie box office this weekend. After a whirlwind four weeks in theaters, the singer\u2019s Eras Tour concert film has shattered records and helped the theater industry weather a light release calendar. Heading into its final weekend, the Eras Tour film has collected $150 million in domestic receipts and more than $200 million globally. That global haul represents more than 18% of the $1.092 billion total global box office earned since the film was released Oct. 13, according to data from Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable, one-of-a-kind, record-breaking and influential run for the Eras Tour, not to mention a huge win for Taylor Swift and theater owners,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. Expectations are that Swift will add another $10 million domestically this weekend and could be the number one film at the box office once again. So far, the Eras Tour film is the highest-grossing domestic and global concert film release of all time, but lags just behind \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It\u201d concert documentary\u2019s global haul of $262.5 million. Swift\u2019s concert film release came at an opportune time. Labor strikes in Hollywood led a number of films to depart the theatrical calendar, including the much-anticipated \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d from Warner Bros. Discovery and Legendary Entertainment. \u201cOne movie can make all the difference,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cThis incredible box office performance is made all the more impressive given the film\u2019s truncated release pattern that had it essentially playing on big screens four days a week.\u201d Swift\u2019s unique release, coupled with her decision to distribute the film through the theater chain AMC instead of a traditional Hollywood studio, has also led to increased speculation about where the concert film will land on streaming. Currently, it appears that Swift is waiting for the SAG-AFTRA strike to wrap up before negotiating with streamers for the rights to her concert film. The film is much-coveted in the industry and a big bidding battle is expected. Swift has previously worked with Apple Music, Netflix and Disney to release filmed versions of her concerts and documentary projects. ",

        "title": "Hiring is slowing \u2014 slowly. It might be just what the economy needs.",
        "content": "Weaker-than-expected job growth in October and a slight uptick in unemployment show the red-hot job market is finally cooling. That\u2019s a good thing. The Federal Reserve has been trying to get the worst inflation in years under control by raising interest rates. A slowing job market may be evidence that its strategy is working. \u201cWith less heat seen in the job market, this report should go over well at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said in a note Friday. For the second time in a row, the Fed left rates untouched at a 23-year high after its latest meeting Wednesday, while keeping alive the possibility of further hikes if inflation resurges. \u201cFed officials looking for more tempered economic data sure found it in this month\u2019s jobs numbers,\u201d agreed Jesse Wheeler, senior economist at Morning Consult. \u201cThe rate hiking cycle may have come to an end,\u201d he predicted in a note after the jobs data came out. Some policymakers have worried the Fed has been too aggressive and will tip the economy into recession. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other progressives have accused Fed Chairman Jerome Powell of sacrificing millions of American jobs to combat inflation, which clocked in at an annual rate of 3.7% in September. That\u2019s much lower than the 9.1% peak hit in June 2022 but still well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Goldilocks scenario is if the job market can remain solid but cool slightly \u2014 and gradually \u2014 while inflation continues to trend lower. One month does not make a trend, of course. The labor market\u2019s sturdy performance has surprised most economists over the past year. While October\u2019s 150,000 net job gains came in lower than expected \u2014 nearly half of September\u2019s revised level \u2014 hiring growth is still strong. Compared with the 258,000 monthly average over the past 12 months, last month\u2019s job gains look rather low. But if not for the United Auto Workers strikes, October\u2019s hiring levels would be on par with the 179,000 jobs added each month on average during the pre-pandemic year of 2019. Many striking autoworkers are already back on the job and will be reflected in next month\u2019s data. (All but around 2,000 of the 35,000 jobs lost across the manufacturing sector last month came from the auto industry.) Overall, many economists say the labor market remains resilient, posting 34 consecutive months of job growth and a jobless rate below 4% for the last two years. And while millions of households are still struggling with basic expenses ranging from housing to groceries in a year when most pandemic-era lifelines have expired, many workers\u2019 paychecks are still growing faster than inflation is eating them up. Average hourly earnings have eased, but year-over-year wages are up 4.1%, compared with a 3.7% annual increase in consumer prices. So far, that has made many consumers comfortable continuing to spend, even if they pull back in some areas or get more vigilant about hunting for deals. \u201cThe good news here for workers is that in the horserace against inflation, wages are ahead by a nose,\u201d Hamrick wrote. And this is one race where slow and steady wins. Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News. ",

        "content": "Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon out of his Seattle garage in 1994, is leaving the city and moving to Miami to be near his parents and his space company Blue Origin. Bezos announced the decision in an Instagram post late Thursday, which included a video of him touring one of Amazon\u2019s earliest offices, the garage of his rented home in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington. It was there that Bezos in 1995 launched Amazon as an online bookseller, before transforming the company into a retail and cloud computing giant. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Seattle longer than I\u2019ve lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAs exciting as the move is, it\u2019s an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart.\u201d Amazon\u2019s rapid growth reshaped Seattle, particularly its South Lake Union area, where the company\u2019s headquarters sits. Its rise helped turn Seattle into a tech hub, leading to an influx of highly paid tech workers, but also higher rents and homelessness. Bezos stepped down as Amazon\u2019s CEO in 2021, turning the helm over to former cloud boss Andy Jassy. Bezos transitioned to executive chair of Amazon\u2019s board. After stepping down as Amazon CEO, Bezos has spent more time on personal ambitions such as the Earth Fund and Blue Origin, as well as the Washington Post, which he acquired in 2013.

        "title": "Matthew Perry reportedly got $20 million a year in 'Friends' residuals. Here's who may get them now.",
        "content": "Matthew Perry, the beloved actor best known for his role as sarcastic, wise-cracking Chandler Bing on the sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d died Saturday at age 54. He left behind a legion of fans and a sizable estate. A significant portion of the actor\u2019s wealth came from his most iconic role. That income reportedly amounts to $20 million a year, from syndication and streaming revenue. A spokesperson for Warner Bros., which owns the show\u2019s distribution rights, declined to verify or comment on the residual payments. CNBC was unable to reach Perry\u2019s representatives for comment. When an actor passes away, residual payments are considered the actor\u2019s personal property. Now, this residual cash flow stream is presumably owned by his estate. There could be three possibilities for the inheritance of Perry\u2019s \u201cFriends\u201d residuals based on laws in California, where he resided, said Charlie Douglas, a certified financial planner and president of HH Legacy Investments in Atlanta. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has contracts in which its members can list beneficiaries for residual payments upon death. As one option, Perry could have named an individual or individuals here. (It\u2019s a similar exercise to naming a beneficiary for common types of accounts like 401(k) or individual retirement accounts.) As a second option, Perry may have named a trust \u2014 and not an individual \u2014 as the beneficiary of his residual payments, Douglas said. The residuals would flow to the trust and the trust would, in turn, have stipulations as to who received them. Unlike wills, which are a matter of public record in probate, trusts are private \u2014 in which case the public may never know who inherits Perry\u2019s \u201cFriends\u201d income. However, there\u2019s a third option: that Perry didn\u2019t name any beneficiary. In this case, state law would determine his estate plan. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that, not having a spouse or children, he didn\u2019t [write in] anything,\u201d Douglas said. All states have a framework that dictates how your cash and belongings ought to be distributed when you die. These are known as intestacy laws, and they vary from state to state. In most states, this is the typical hierarchy for inheritance, in order of who stands to receive assets: first the spouse, then children, grandchildren, parents and, finally, siblings, Douglas said. Perry never married or had children. He is survived by his parents (who divorced when Perry was less than a year old and have both since remarried) and five half-siblings. In California, his parents will be the likely takers of Perry\u2019s royalties from acting roles, as well as other parts of his estate including his 2022 memoir, according to Tasha Dickinson, trusts and estates partner at Day Pitney. If this were the case, his parents could elect to make a \u201cqualified disclaimer\u201d giving up their rights to the residuals, in which case the money would pass to the half-siblings, Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of at all that wealthy parents make disclaimers,\u201d he said. For example, Perry\u2019s stepfather is Keith Morrison, an award-winning broadcast journalist and longtime correspondent for NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline.\u201d Otherwise, Perry\u2019s assets will be divided up based on the probate court system. \u201cProbate is especially undesirable in California because it\u2019s expensive, time-consuming and an invasion of privacy [since] all court matters are public record,\u201d said David Oh, head of tax and estate planning at Arta Finance. For celebrities like Perry, especially, \u201cnot having an estate plan creates confusion, attracts unwanted media attention and can cause family disputes,\u201d he added. Perry may have also opted to leave his estate outside his family. He had close relationships personally and professionally and supported several philanthropic interests, \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see some of his wealth go towards them,\u201d Oh said. The actor, who publicly struggled with addiction for years, once opened a sober living facility at his Malibu mansion and was working to create a foundation for addiction issues. On Nov. 3, the Matthew Perry Foundation was established in his name as a donor-advised fund. The charity is sponsored and maintained by National Philanthropic Trust. \u201cWhen I die, I know people will talk about \u2018Friends,\u2019 \u2018Friends,\u2019 \u2018Friends,\u2018\u201d Perry said during an interview in 2022. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad of that, happy I\u2019ve done some solid work as an actor ... But when I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if \u2018Friends\u2019 were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people. I know it won\u2019t happen, but it would be nice.\u201d Charitably inclined people can also use their donations to avoid or reduce estate taxes. Charitable contributions aren\u2019t subject to estate taxes, Douglas said. For 2023, individuals can leave up to $12.92 million to heirs without triggering a federal estate-tax bill. Beyond that, the federal estate tax rate is 40%, and although California has no estate tax or inheritance tax, that can still mean a big bill for someone like Perry, according to Oh of Arta Finance.  Sometimes, charitably minded people will donate any assets above the estate-tax threshold to charity and leave the remainder to heirs, thereby avoiding estate taxes altogether, Douglas said. Often, such high-net worth taxpayers work with advisors on these types of strategies. \u201cEstate planning is not fun \u2014 not many people enjoy confronting their mortality \u2014 but the more money and assets, whether they be real or intellectual property or copyrights or royalties one has, the more important it is to have all the proverbial ducks in row,\u201d said David Johnston, a certified financial planner and managing partner of Amwell Ridge Wealth Management.

        "title": "Tens of thousands of Las Vegas Strip hotel workers at 18 casinos could on go strike this month",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel workers set a deadline Thursday for a sweeping strike, threatening major disruptions to the city\u2019s economic backbone that could coincide with the Strip\u2019s inaugural Formula 1 races later this month. The Culinary Workers Union said about 35,000 members whose contracts expired earlier this year are ready and willing to walk off the job at 18 casinos if deals aren\u2019t reached by Nov. 10 with casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts. That\u2019s five days before the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend, which is expected to bring thousands of people to the Strip, is set to kick off with an opening ceremony. At a news conference, Ted Pappageorge, the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer and chief contract negotiator, urged tourists and Formula 1 ticket-holders to support the workers if they go on strike by not coming to Las Vegas or crossing the picket lines. \u201cWe will be communicating to ask customers that they should take their business elsewhere,\u201d he said. Formula 1 did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Pappageorge said the union and its members hope it doesn\u2019t come to a strike but that \u201cworkers are prepared, united and ready to strike if necessary.\u201d Nevada\u2019s largest labor union, with about 60,000 members statewide, hasn\u2019t gone on strike in decades. A walkout would be the latest in a series of high-profile labor unrest actions around the country \u2014 from walkouts in Hollywood to UPS\u2019 contentious negotiations that threatened to disrupt the nation\u2019s supply chain \u2014 and would follow hospitality workers walking off the job last month at Detroit\u2019s three casinos, including MGM Grand Detroit. In Las Vegas, the 18 properties that could be impacted by a strike are Aria, Bellagio, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, New York-New York, Park MGM, Caesars Palace, Flamingo, Harrah\u2019s, Horseshoe, Paris Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood, The Cromwell, The Linq, and Wynn and Encore Resorts. The union\u2019s deadline comes after yet another unsuccessful round of negotiations with the three casino companies. A spokesperson for Wynn Resorts declined to comment. Caesars and MGM Resorts did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Negotiations have been underway since April over topics such as pay and working conditions. Members currently receive health insurance and earn about $26 hourly, including benefits, union spokesperson Bethany Khan said. She declined to say how much the union is seeking in pay raises because, she said, \u201cwe do not negotiate in public,\u201d but the union has said it is asking for \u201cthe largest wage increases ever negotiated\u201d in its history. Hospitality workers \u2014 from bartenders and cocktail servers to kitchen employees and housekeepers \u2014 have also said they want better job security amid advancements in technology, as well as stronger security protections, including more safety buttons. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel safe on the casino floor,\u201d veteran Bellagio cocktail waitress Leslie Lilla told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need enhanced security. We need emergency buttons in our service bars. We want to be protected, as well as for our guests.\u201d The union said it had been patient with the casino companies over seven months of negotiations that spurred large-scale rallies on the Strip, including one in October that brought rush-hour traffic to a halt and ended with the arrests of 58 hotel workers who sat in the street in what they described at the time as a show of force ahead of any potential strike. \u201cThis is our time. This is the labor movement\u2019s time,\u201d Lilla said. \u201cWe know that we can\u2019t be a society where it\u2019s just upper class and lower class. There\u2019s got to be a middle. Unions create that middle class.\u201d ",

        "content": "The U.S. economy saw job creation decelerate in October, confirming persistent expectations for a slowdown and possibly taking some heat off the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 for the month, the Labor Department reported Friday, against the Dow Jones consensus forecast for an increase of 170,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, against expectations that it would hold steady at 3.8%. Employment as measured in the household survey, which is used to compute the unemployment rate, showed a decline of 348,000 workers, while the rolls of the unemployed rose by 146,000. A more encompassing jobless rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons rose to 7.2%, an increase of 0.2 percentage point. Average hourly earnings, a key measure for inflation, increased 0.2% for the month, less than the 0.3% forecast, while the 4.1% year over year again was 0.1 percentage point above expectations. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 100 points.

        "title": "Starbucks unveils plan to add 17,000 locations by 2030",
        "content": "Starbucks on Thursday presented the latest stage in its plan to drive growth for the company, which involves accelerating its global footprint and saving $3 billion in costs over the next three years. The company said it plans to expand to 35,000 locations outside of North America by 2030. Starbucks currently has roughly 20,200 international cafes, as of Oct. 1. In total, the coffee giant aims to reach 55,000 locations globally by 2030, up from its current count of more than 38,000. \u201cThree out of every four new stores over the near term is expected to be opened outside of the U.S. as our store portfolio becomes increasingly global,\u201d Michael Conway, president of Starbucks\u2019 international and channel development divisions, said during a company presentation. Starbucks also announced a $3 billion cost-saving plan. Executives said $1 billion of those savings will come from making its stores more efficient. The rest will come from savings on the cost of goods sold. The final piece of what Starbucks called its \u201cTriple Shot Reinvention Strategy,\u201d announced Thursday, calls for wage increases for baristas, doubling their hourly income over fiscal 2020 earnings by the end of fiscal 2025. That jump will come from both increased hours and higher pay. Starbucks said it would share more details next week. The announcement comes after more than 350 Starbucks locations have unionized under Workers United, according to National Labor Relations Board data. Starbucks and the union have not yet reached a collective bargaining agreement at any of those locations, and both the union and the NLRB have accused Starbucks of breaking federal labor law, including illegally withholding wage hikes at union stores. The company denies all allegations of union busting. Earlier Thursday, the company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results. Starbucks beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates for both its quarterly earnings and revenue, sending shares up 9.5%. The stock move reversed shares\u2019 losses earlier this year, giving the company a market cap of $115 billion, as of Thursday\u2019s close. During the company\u2019s conference call, CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company\u2019s \u201creinvention\u201d plan unveiled last September is moving ahead of schedule, driving both sales and efficiency for Starbucks. For example, the chain\u2019s new single-cup drip coffee brewer is now installed in more than 600 locations. More broadly, that plan takes aim at many of the issues plaguing Starbucks and baristas in recent years. Drink orders have grown more complicated and time-intensive as cold beverages become more popular and Starbucks pushes pricey add-ons such as cold foam. Customers have also shifted to ordering their drinks through the company\u2019s mobile app and drive-thru lanes and expect their orders to arrive more quickly. Under that pressure, baristas have struggled to maintain speedy service and quality customer experience. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz unveiled the reinvention plan to simplify operations and improve both quality and speed of service more than a year ago. The strategy involves new coffee-making equipment and store formats plus more automation. Schultz, then back at the company for a third stint in the top job, said Starbucks had made \u201cself-induced mistakes\u201d and lost its way. He stepped down from the role in March, handing the reins over to Narasimhan, a newcomer to the company who pledged to enact the plan. At its investor day last September, Starbucks projected earnings per share growth of 15% to 20% annually over the next three years and annual same-store sales growth of 7% to 9%. The company\u2019s same-store sales outlook of 5% to 7% for fiscal 2024 falls short of that range, but the rest of its forecast for the next fiscal year meets those targets. ",

        "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts at fraud trial over crypto exchange FTX",
        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, once hailed as a genius in cryptocurrency, was found guilty Thursday of all fraud counts against him, a year after his exchange, FTX, imploded and practically wiped out thousands of customers. The verdict was reached around 7:40 p.m. ET, about four hours after the federal jury in Manhattan began deliberations. Bankman-Fried, a co-founder of the digital currency exchange FTX, was charged with seven counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering that swindled customers of FTX and lenders to its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried \u201cperpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said after the verdict. \u201cThe cryptocurrency industry might be new; the players like Bankman-Fried might be new,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time.\u201d Bankman-Fried faces up to 110 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28. FTX and Alameda quickly collapsed in November 2022 after some of their financial liabilities were exposed. The fact that Alameda had taken billions of dollars from FTX's customers, and that much of Alameda's balance sheet comprised digital currency assets the firm itself had created, was central to the case against Bankman-Fried. Unnerved by disclosures about the firm's financial position, many of FTX\u2019s customers tried to get their money back. That set off the equivalent of a bank run. The value of Alameda's investments crashed, and FTX couldn\u2019t return much of clients' money because it had been given to Alameda. Some went to the fund\u2019s lenders, and billions were spent on sponsorships, commercials and loans to top executives. That, too, was a major part of the case against Bankman-Fried. Many of FTX and Alameda's leaders were also charged after the firms went under. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and FTX head of engineering Nishad Singh all pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and testify against Bankman-Fried in exchange for lighter sentences. While Bankman-Fried testified in his own defense, it didn\u2019t appear to have the same weight as the insider testimony against him. The prosecution, in its closing argument, said Bankman-Fried had answered \u201cI can\u2019t recall\u201d 140 times while he was being cross-examined. Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers contended that he did not intend to defraud anyone and that the government was looking for someone to blame after the failures of FTX and Alameda. Bankman-Fried was asked to rise and face the jury as the verdicts were read Thursday, and he did so. He showed little emotion as each verdict was read. His father slumped in his seat, hunched over as each guilty verdict came in. His mother was visibly emotional. Mark S. Cohen, Bankman-Fried\u2019s counsel, said in an emailed statement Thursday that Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team respects the jury\u2019s decision but that they are disappointed. \u201cMr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,\u201d he said. Forbes had once estimated that Bankman-Fried's stakes in Alameda and FTX were worth $26 billion. He was 29 at the time. But after the bankruptcies, that was gone. Criminal charges followed weeks later. He also faces another trial on charges of bribing foreign officials and other counts. That trial is scheduled to begin in March, and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Thursday, Bankman-Fried was found guilty of two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Williams, the prosecutor, said Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction should send a message to others. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning, this case, to every single fraudster out there who thinks that they\u2019re untouchable or that their crimes are too complex for us to catch or that they\u2019re too powerful for us to prosecute or that they could try to talk their way out of it when they get caught,\u201d he said. \u201cThose folks should think again.\u201d Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. Dawn Giel is a journalist for CNBC based out of the global headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ, where she is a field producer for CNBC TV and regularly reports for CNBC.com.

        "title": "PragerU buys 'takeover' ad on X as part of $1M campaign to promote polarizing 'Detrans' film",
        "content": "The Prager University Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, purchased a \u201ctakeover\u201d ad on X on Thursday as part of a larger $1 million marketing campaign to promote its polarizing film \u201cDetrans: The Dangers of Gender-Affirming Care.\u201d The 21-minute film focuses on two people who have detransitioned, meaning they previously identified as transgender and later decided they were not. Though both of them began transitioning when they were adults, their stories are part of the film\u2019s larger criticism of transition-related care for minors, which has recently become the target of Republican state legislators, who have passed laws to restrict puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery in 22 states over the last three years.  PragerU\u2019s X takeover represents X\u2019s shift toward promoting more conservative \u2014 and, critics would argue, more extreme \u2014 views after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk purchased the platform and removed many of the policies that barred ads promoting anti-LGBTQ views or misinformation, reinstated accounts that previous Twitter management had suspended for anti-LGBTQ harassment, and shared an anti-trans video from his own account. The \"takeover\" placement meant the ad for the \"Detrans\" was the first one displayed for most users of the social media platform throughout the day. In June, X\u2019s chief of trust and safety resigned after Musk publicly undermined her decision to moderate the spread of the same anti-trans video. Craig Strazzeri, PragerU\u2019s chief marketing officer, named Musk as part of the reason the nonprofit group advertised on X.  \u201cWe decided to pursue an X takeover because it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to reach a massive audience on the dangers of gender affirming care given that X is one of the least censored social media platforms thanks to Elon Musk,\u201d Strazzeri said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis will give millions of people the opportunity to hear important stories from detransitioners themselves, many of whom have been censored and even ostracized because their lived experiences do not affirm the mainstream media\u2019s narrative.\u201d Strazzeri said the organization hopes that, after they have watched \u201cDetrans,\u201d \u201cviewers will have a better understanding of how young Americans are being manipulated by social media and medical professionals to undergo life-altering surgeries that often come with major regret.\u201d Strazzeri\u2019s comments echo language used by conservative groups and lawmakers who have advocated for restricting care for minors. However, more than a dozen major medical associations \u2014 including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association \u2014 support access to care and have opposed laws that restrict it. PragerU did not immediately reply to an additional request for comment about criticism of the film and the medical community\u2019s support for access to care. In contrast to X, YouTube rejected PragerU\u2019s ad takeover placement \u201calmost immediately upon submission,\u201d PragerU said in a news release. The advocacy group said multiple film festivals have also rejected the film. YouTube spokesperson Michael Aciman said the platform did not reject PragerU's ad completely. \"The ads in question do not violate our ads policies and are currently running across our platforms,\" Aciman said in an email. \"In accordance with our YouTube ad requirements, since 2021, ads related to political topics are ineligible to run on the YouTube Masthead.\u201d There have been a number of documentaries about people who have detransitioned in recent years, and in some cases, theaters have canceled screenings because of backlash. Some advocates and trans people have criticized the films \u2014 including \u201cDetrans\u201d \u2014 which they say are misleading because they focus on the small number of people who detransition when the overwhelming majority of trans people report being happier after transition. A 2021 review of 27 studies that evaluated rates of regret among people 13 and older who received gender-affirming surgery found that an average of 1% experienced regret. \u201cDetrans\u201d criticizes young people\u2019s access to transition-related care, but both of its main characters began medical transition when they were legal adults. Daisy Strongin, for example, was 18 when she began testosterone, though the film does not disclose that and it shows videos and images of Strongin in which she looks younger. Abel Garcia, the other main character, says in the film that he was 19 when he began medical transition. The documentary describes the case of Layla Jane, who alleged in an ongoing lawsuit filed in June against the Kaiser Hospital Foundation that she received hormones and a double mastectomy at 13, but it does not interview her. Kaiser Permanente, the network that includes the Kaiser Hospital Foundation, said its transgender care services \"are aligned to guidelines endorsed by major medical associations to meet individual patient needs.\" \"When adolescent patients, with parental consent, seek gender-affirming care, the patient\u2019s care team carefully evaluates their treatment options and then a multidisciplinary team of physicians and other experienced professionals are available to provide the patient and their family with information, counseling, and other support,\" it said in an emailed statement Thursday. Though not all trans people pursue medical transition, access to gender-affirming care for minors is widely supported among the medical community, and it has been found to improve mental health outcomes and reduce suicidality. Standards of care developed by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a nonprofit professional association devoted to transgender health, recommends that treatment for all trans people, including minors, be individualized and require informed consent from both the patient and, in the case of a minor, at least one of the patient\u2019s parents. The standards of care recommend gender-affirming mastectomies for minors only in very rare circumstances. PragerU\u2019s \u201cDetrans\u201d documentary argues that young people are fast-tracked into medical transition, though it does not include the viewpoints of any physicians.  It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people a trending takeover ad on X reaches. The ad information on the platform\u2019s business site says takeover ads \u201care the most premium, mass-reach placements that drive results across the funnel by taking over the Timeline and Explore tabs.\u201d X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the estimated reach of an X trending takeover ad. X users who saw the ad Thursday had a variety of reactions, from enthusiastic praise for the film to criticism of it for pushing \u201charmful lies.\u201d  Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ rights organization, condemned Musk and X for \u201cprioritizing their bottom line over the lived experience and humanity of transgender people.\u201d  \u201cSo-called documentaries like the one peddled by PragerU do nothing more than spread misinformation and stigmatize transgender people,\u201d Robinson said in a statement. \u201cGiven the growing threats of violence faced by the transgender community, offering a platform to this type of hate-filled propaganda is not just immoral\u2014it\u2019s dangerous. Today\u2019s timeline takeover is another stain on the platform.\u201d Jo Yurcaba is a reporter for NBC Out. ",

        "title": "Homebuyers and sellers face an uncertain wait for billion-dollar verdict to hit their wallets",
        "content": "The historic $1.78 billion National Association of Realtors verdict in Kansas City, Missouri, this week could trigger a major disruption in the housing market, but it\u2019s unclear when millions of people will know how the decision will affect residential real estate costs. The case hinged on the commissions, usually of 6%, that sellers pay their agents, who then split them with the buyers\u2019 agents. It has been a cornerstone of how the NAR \u2014 a powerful trade group of 1.5 million members \u2014 does business. But after just hours of deliberation, a jury found that this standard industry practice amounts to collusion to inflate real estate fees. When Jerod Breit, a police officer, was selling his Missouri home a few years ago, he said, it was understandable that he\u2019d need to pay a commission to his broker. But the buyer\u2019s broker, too? \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things the system doesn\u2019t tell you to think about \u2014 that\u2019s just how it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after I sold my house in 2017 that it really made me think about that other 3% I was paying to someone that I had never met, I will never meet and did nothing for me.\u201d Breit joined the class-action lawsuit led by attorney Michael Ketchmark, who called the traditional commission-sharing between agents who should be competitors an \u201cunconscionable\u201d conspiracy. \u201cIt\u2019s the only system, the only industry, in the United States where two competitors get together, they set the compensation and they split it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re running it like a cartel.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from Kansas City, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 we love Chiefs football here,\u201d Ketchmark said. \u201cWhen the Denver Broncos come to town, I don\u2019t pay the coach\u2019s salary. Why should you pay?\u201d Ketchmark vowed more suits to come, and the NAR still faces other scrutiny from authorities. In June, the Justice Department asked a federal judge\u2019s permission to resume an antitrust probe into the association. The NAR \u2014 whose chief executive, Bob Goldberg, stepped down Thursday \u2014 has already promised to appeal Tuesday\u2019s decision. Two brokerages were also found liable alongside the trade group, while several other defendants had already settled the claims. \u201cNAR rules prioritize consumers, support market-driven pricing and promote business competition,\u201d the group said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis matter is not close to being final.\u201d The ongoing legal wrangling leaves consumers in a holding pattern. A long-held industry standard has been seriously challenged, and the ultimate damages awarded could even be tripled, to over $5 billion, under antitrust law. But for now, the practice remains intact at a time of historically challenging conditions for buyers and sellers alike. \u201cNothing changes today,\u201d Bess Freedman, the CEO of the luxury brokerage Brown Harris Stevens, said of the ruling. Her firm, a member of the NAR, wasn\u2019t involved in the litigation \u2014 whose outcome she said won\u2019t tackle the real pain point for consumers, which comes from historically pricey mortgages. Popular 30-year fixed mortgage rates are hovering at decadeslong highs of around 8%, and the supply of homes remains far below normal, not enough to meet demand. A U.S. homebuyer\u2019s dollar now goes about half as far as it did in late 2020. The legal uncertainty is just another reason homeowners may be inclined to wait to list their homes. For years, millions of homebuyers locked in rates below 5%, amounting to golden handcuffs that are now keeping many of them in properties they\u2019d otherwise sell. And for new buyers, the low supply of homes for sale is pushing prices too high for their budgets. With Wall Street largely expecting the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated for some time to come, there\u2019s little sign that mortgage rates are falling any time soon. For homebuyers, paying 6% commissions on what are most likely the largest purchases they\u2019ll ever make is significant. \u201cI kind of freaked out,\u201d Tali Strom said about realizing the extra fees she\u2019d have to pay for selling her home. Strom, who works at a Jewish American nonprofit group, is in contract to sell her house in Chappaqua, New York, for nearly $1.2 million, with a closing date set for Dec. 7. She acknowledged she has a great relationship with her broker and said she was happy with the services she\u2019d received. \u201cI want to give her every dollar,\u201d Strom said, but she voiced frustration that her agent would have to hand chunks of it over to her brokerage and, subsequently, to the buyer\u2019s agent. \u201cI am critical over the fees I pay her company. I don\u2019t feel the amount of time and energy the company put in was worth that.\u201d A generation ago, the buyer\u2019s agent had all the information \u2014 comparable neighborhood sales prices, tax histories, school district placement and particulars of the home \u2014 and was supposed to act as a comprehensive counselor. Strom said she was familiar with that model firsthand. \u201cMy mom was a Realtor growing up. She would get a phone call, the Realtor would do that work,\u201d she said. But she pointed out it\u2019s so much easier now for house hunters to scroll listings online and go through the buying process largely by themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a text message now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe technology has changed.\u201d Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News.

        "title": "Amazon used an algorithm to essentially raise prices on other sites, the FTC says",
        "content": "Amazon used a secret algorithm that essentially helped the company raise prices on other online sites and \u201cdestroyed\u201d some internal communications as the Federal Trade Commission was investigating the company, according to a newly unredacted portions of the agency\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against the e-commerce giant. The new excerpts, unveiled Thursday, alleged company executives intentionally deleted communication by using a feature on the popular app Signal that makes messages disappear. By doing this, the FTC said Amazon \u201cdestroyed more than two years\u201d worth of communications from June 2019 to \u201cat least early 2022\u201d despite instructions it gave Amazon not to do so. In a prepared statement Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle called the FTC\u2019s claim \u201cbaseless and irresponsible.\u201d \u201cAmazon voluntarily disclosed employee Signal use to the FTC, painstakingly collected Signal conversations from its employees\u2019 phones, and allowed agency staff to inspect those conversations even when they had nothing to do with the FTC\u2019s investigation,\u201d Doyle said. The FTC and 17 states sued Amazon in September alleging the company was abusing its position in the marketplace to inflate prices on and off its platform, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. Amazon is accused of violating federal and state antitrust laws, but the company has responded with a full-throated defense of its business practices. The antitrust case is the most aggressive move the government has taken to tame the market power of Amazon and comes as the FTC has been taking big swings against tech companies. The unredacted excerpts of the lawsuit disclosed on Thursday also provided more details on a talked-about algorithm, which was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal and former Vox reporter Jason Del Ray. The FTC\u2019s excerpts say the tool \u2014 codenamed \u201cProject Nessie\u201d \u2014 has been used by Amazon to pinpoint products that will allow it to rake in more cash. The company used it to predict where it can raise prices and have other shopping sites follow suit. Amazon activated the algorithm to raise prices on some products, and when other sites followed its lead, it kept the elevated prices in place, the agency said. The use of Nessie has generated more than $1 billion in excess profits for Amazon, according to the FTC. \u201cAware of the public fallout it risks, Amazon has turned Project Nessie off during periods of heightened outside scrutiny and then back on when it thinks that no one is watching,\u201d the complaint said. The agency said Amazon deployed Project Nessie in 2014 and has turned it on and off at least eight times between 2015 and 2019. In 2018 alone, Amazon used the algorithm to set prices for items that were viewed more than 400 million times by shoppers, according to the complaint. Regulators said though Amazon claims the algorithm is \u201ccurrently paused,\u201d the company has thought about running experiments in 2020 and 2021 to improve the effectiveness of Project Nessie. Doyle, the Amazon spokesperson, called Nessie an \u201cold\u201d pricing algorithm that\u2019s being \u201cgrossly\u201d mischaracterized by the agency. \u201cNessie was used to try to stop our price matching from resulting in unusual outcomes where prices became so low that they were unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe project ran for a few years on a subset of products, but didn\u2019t work as intended, so we scrapped it several years ago.\u201d The unredacted portions of the lawsuit also shed more light on Amazon\u2019s advertising business. The agency claimed then-CEO Jeff Bezos instructed executives to accept more junk ads \u2014 internally called \u201cdefects\u201d \u2014 because the company could earn more money through increased advertising despite their presence being a headache for consumers.

        "title": "HBO boss Casey Bloys apologizes for using fake Twitter accounts to troll TV critics",
        "content": "HBO and Max CEO and chairman Casey Bloys apologized to TV critics Thursday for using fake Twitter accounts to respond to negative reviews of HBO series, following a Wednesday report that revealed Bloys\u2019 past behavior. \u201cFor those of you who know me, you know that I am a programming executive very, very passionate about the shows that we decide to do. And the people who do them and the people who work on them,\u201d Bloys said Thursday morning at the start of a presentation at HBO\u2019s New York headquarters, an event to promote HBO and Max\u2019s upcoming slate of programming, which has been planned since Oct. 16. \u201cI want the shows to be great. I want people to love them. I want you all to love them. It\u2019s very important to me what you all think of the shows,\" Bloys said. \"When you think about that, and then think of 2020 and 2021, I\u2019m working from home and doing an unhealthy amount of scrolling through Twitter. And I come up with a very, very dumb idea to vent my frustration.\u201d Bloys continued, \u201cObviously, six tweets over a year and a half is not very effective. But I do apologize to the people who were mentioned in the leaked emails, texts.\" \"Obviously, nobody wants to be part of a story that they have nothing to do with. But also, as many of you know, I have progressed over the past couple of years to using DMs,\" he said. \"So now, when I take issue with something in a review, or take issue with something I see, many of you are gracious enough to engage with me in a back and forth and I think that is a probably a much healthier way to go about this. But we\u2019ll talk more about that, and you guys can ask me anything you want in the Q&A. I just wanted to put that out there.\u201d From there, the HBO chief moved on to start the presentation with footage from the upcoming season of \u201cTrue Detective: Night Country.\u201d Bloys\u2019 remarks come one day after Rolling Stone published a story detailing a lawsuit brought against the exec and HBO from former employee Sully Temori, who claims to have been wrongfully terminated. Though not included in the lawsuit itself, Rolling Stone referenced alleged 2020 and 2021 text messages between Bloys and SVP of drama programming Kathleen McCaffrey. In the alleged text exchanges, Bloys and McCaffrey repeatedly discussed replying to critics who spoke negatively about HBO series, including \u201cPerry Mason\u201d and \u201cMare of Easttown,\u201d by using fake Twitter accounts. Rolling Stone says these text messages, provided by Temori, were reviewed and verified via their metadata. Temori, who at that time was an executive assistant, claims he was instructed to make a Twitter account for these purposes, which he did and attributed it to the fake person Kelly Shepard, a self-described vegan Texan mom. Temori sent tweets from this account in response to critics\u2019 negative reviews. Additionally, Temori told Rolling Stone that he left anonymous comments on some Deadline articles in response to other users\u2019 negative remarks about HBO series and execs, at Bloys\u2019 request. Also mentioned in Temori\u2019s lawsuit are McCaffrey, HBO head of drama Francesca Orsi, Abel \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d Tesfaye and two producers on his now-canceled HBO drama \u201cThe Idol.\u201d Temori alleges that he was mistreated on the set of that series once he became a scripted coordinator on the project in 2021, a position he was moved to from his executive assistant role.

        "title": "Six Flags and Cedar Fair will merge, creating a theme park giant worth over $3.5B",
        "content": "Cedar Fair and Six Flags are merging to create an expansive amusement park operator with operations spread across 17 U.S. states and three countries. The combined company, worth more than $3.5 billion, will boast 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resort properties in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It will also have entertainment partnerships and a portfolio of intellectual property including Looney Tunes, DC Comics and Peanuts. Amusement parks have seen an uptick in revenue but have struggled to raise attendance since the pandemic, even as other entertainment sectors have bounced back. A tie-up between two huge players is expected to at least lower costs. Cedar Fair reported an attendance of 12.4 million guests in its third quarter, a 1% increase from a year earlier. Six Flags announced a 16% rise in its third-quarter attendance, which totaled 9.3 million guests. Six Flags and Cedar Fair, which have little geographical overlap, anticipate $120 million in cost savings within two years of closing the deal. Under the agreement announced Thursday, Cedar Fair unitholders will receive one share of common stock in the combined company for each unit owned, while Six Flags shareholders will receive 0.5800 shares of stock in the combined company for each share owned. Cedar Fair unitholders will own approximately 51.2% of the combined company, while Six Flags shareholders will own about 48.8%. \u201cOur merger with Six Flags will bring together two of North America\u2019s iconic amusement park companies to establish a highly diversified footprint and a more robust operating model to enhance park offerings and performance,\u201d Cedar Fair CEO Richard Zimmerman said in a prepared statement. Zimmerman will be president and CEO of the combined company. Selim Bassoul, president and CEO of Six Flags, will become executive chairman. The companies said that given their broader geographic footprint as a single company, seasonal volatility should moderate. The company\u2019s newly formed board will include six directors from Cedar Fair and six directors from Six Flags. The company will be headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and will keep significant finance and administrative operations in Sandusky, Ohio, where Cedar Fair is based. Six Flags is now based in Arlington, Texas. Once the deal closes, the combined company will operate under the name Six Flags and trade under the ticker symbol \u201cFUN\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. The transaction, which was approved by both companies\u2019 boards, is targeted to close in the first half of next year. It still needs approval from Six Flags shareholders. Shares of Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP were essentially flat before the opening bell Thursday, but both are up more than 9% this week after rumors of a deal began to spread. ",

        "content": "DETROIT \u2014 Toyota said Wednesday it is recalling nearly 1.9 million RAV4 small SUVs in the U.S. to fix a problem with batteries that can move during forceful turns and potentially cause a fire. The recall covers certain RAV4s from the 2013 through 2018 model years. Toyota said in a statement that some replacement 12-volt batteries used in the SUVs have smaller top dimensions than others. If the hold-down clamp is not tightened properly, the battery could move, allowing the positive terminal to contact the clamp and short circuit, the company said. Toyota said it is still preparing a fix. When the remedy is ready, dealers will replace the hold-down clamp, battery tray and positive terminal cover with improved ones. The company said it will notify owners by late December. Toyota declined to say if the problem had caused any fires, crashes or injuries. Owners can check to see if their RAV4s are involved by going to www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and entering their vehicle identification number. ",

        "title": "Uber, Lyft to pay $328 million to settle wage-theft allegations in New York state",
        "content": "Uber and Lyft agreed to pay a combined $328 million to settle allegations the ride-hailing companies unlawfully withheld wages from drivers and failed to provide mandatory paid sick leave in New York state, Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office said Thursday. Uber will pay $290 million and Lyft will pay $38 million. The state AG\u2019s office said it\u2019s the largest wage-theft settlement it\u2019s won. The money will go to drivers affected by the companies\u2019 alleged practices. More than 100,000 drivers in New York could be eligible to receive the funds and benefits secured under the agreements, James\u2019 office said. Drivers will be notified by mail, email or text about how to file a claim. \u201cFor years, Uber and Lyft systemically cheated their drivers out of hundreds of millions of dollars in pay and benefits while they worked long hours in challenging conditions,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cThis settlement will ensure they finally get what they have rightfully earned and are owed under the law. My office will continue to make sure that companies operating in the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 do not deprive workers of their rights or undermine the laws meant to protect them.\u201d  The settlements, which resolve multiyear investigations, reflect the companies\u2019 latest concessions in a standoff with regulators across the country about the level of oversight they should receive and what they owe their drivers. Uber and Lyft have previously fought efforts to reclassify their workers from contractors to employees, for example, a change they said most of their workers opposed. Uber\u2019s settlement represents more than 3% of the $9.23 billion in revenue it generated last quarter. And Lyft\u2019s settlement comes to nearly 4% of the $1.02 billion in revenue it reported. The companies also agreed to ongoing changes in how they pay drivers and offer benefits in the Empire State. The AG\u2019s office alleged the companies incorrectly deducted charges from drivers\u2019 wages that should have instead been charged to passengers. For example, the office said that from 2014 to 2017 Uber deducted sales taxes and Black Car Fund fees from drivers\u2019 paychecks and misrepresented that it would do so in its terms of service. And Lyft, the AG alleged, deducted an 11.4% administrative charge that equaled the amount of the sales tax and Black Car Fund fees between 2015 and 2017. Both companies also failed to provide paid sick leave as required under state and New York City law, James alleged. Under the agreements, Uber and Lyft will be required to give drivers outside of New York City a guaranteed earning minimum of $26 per hour, which will be adjusted each year for inflation. The minimum rate would apply from \u201cdispatch to completion of the ride,\u201d according to a press release from the AG\u2019s office. Drivers in New York City already receive guaranteed minimum earnings under local regulations. Drivers also will get guaranteed paid sick leave in New York state. For every 30 hours worked, they\u2019ll be able to earn one hour of sick pay up to 56 hours per year, the AG\u2019s office said. Both companies will make updates so drivers can request sick leave through the apps, according to the press release. Uber and Lyft also agreed to give drivers compensation breakdowns, the AG\u2019s office said. The companies will have to notify drivers how much a rider paid for each ride and give drivers an in-app chat tool to discuss earnings and work conditions. Uber and Lyft also must allow drivers to appeal deactivation from their platforms. ",

        "title": "What to know about eyedrops safety after recall and FDA warnings",
        "content": "The Food and Drug Administration recently cautioned consumers against using 27 different kinds of eyedrops \u2014 its third eyedrop-related warning this year \u2014 leading Americans to question whether any drops are safe to use. On Wednesday, the FDA said that pharmaceutical company Cardinal Health was recalling eyedrops sold under the Rugby brand after it received three reports of blurry vision, vision loss and burning eyes. Overall, however, experts say that artificial tears are not dangerous provided that consumers are aware of what they're putting in their eyes, and take certain precautions while doing it. \"Any lubricating drop that has not been recalled and is still available on pharmacy shelves should be perfectly safe,\" Dr. Christopher Starr, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, wrote in an email. Autumn, with its emergence of cold, dry air and proliferation of ragweed and other allergens, is peak eyedrop season, experts say. At least 117 million Americans used eyedrop products in 2020, according to Statista, a data research company. The group expects that number will rise to more than 123 million in 2024. In 2023, however, the FDA came out with several dire warnings about contamination of these commonly used products. Experts and health officials are concerned about the risks from using the drops. \"We urge consumers to stop using these products, as it could result in an eye infection,\" the FDA said in an emailed statement. It is unclear what prompted the agency to look closely at this particular facility, which has not been named. When bacteria enter our bodies through cuts in the skin or through food we eat, our immune systems are trained to kick in. White blood cells surge to form scabs. Stomach acids attack. But eyes are particularly vulnerable to foreign invaders. They \"don't have that level of protection,\" said Dr. Morgan Morelli, assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \"You're putting the product straight onto the eye.\" An outer layer of the eye, called the corneal dome, does not have blood vessels that are usually critical in the immune system process because the eye \"has to maintain a crystal clarity,\" said Dr. Ronald Benner, president of the American Optometric Association. When allergens prompt people to rub and itch their eyes, it can cause tiny scratches on the surface of the eye, opening the door wide for bacterial infections. \"When you have an infection in that tissue, the body can't fight it as quickly,\" Benner said. \"Putting a drop in that's contaminated makes things worse.\" Given the recalls, experts say the first thing consumers should do is check their medicine cabinets, purses, desk drawers, junk drawers and any other places eyedrops may be kept. This is a list of the latest drops the FDA says to stop using. Experts also recommend using only brand name eyedrops and other artificial tear products. \"There are some generics out there that are probably fine and safe, but you never know where they are manufactured,\" Benner said. \"You never know how long they've been on the shelf.\" Morelli agreed, even though brands tend to be more expensive than generics. She said she paused recently when faced with spending $30 on eyedrops for herself. \"When it comes to the eyes, you're probably safer spending more money and going with a brand name,\" Morelli said. Starr, also an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, reminds all patients to check the expiration dates on eyedrop bottles. \"If expired, please discard them, as there is a higher risk of contamination even with nonrecalled, well-manufactured eyedrops,\" he said.

        "title": "Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchanged for now",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday as it continues to track inflation and the health of the economy. The central bank voted unanimously to leave its primary interest rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%. U.S. interest rates are the highest they've been in 23 years. That means interest rates on loans such as mortgages have gone up sharply, and so have payments on Treasury bonds and interest-bearing accounts. In a statement, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee said the economy continues to grow at a strong pace and the jobs market remains strong as well, although it has weakened in recent months. It added that inflation remains high. The Fed meets eight times a year, and it has now left rates unchanged for two meetings in a row. That hadn\u2019t happened since March 2022, when it started raising rates at a rapid clip. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for the financial services company Bankrate, said the Fed didn't need to raise its benchmark rate because other interest rates have continued to rise. \"The rise in long-term interest rates in recent months has had the same desired effect of monetary tightening, effectively doing some of the Fed\u2019s dirty work for them,\" he said in a statement to NBC News. The Fed made a similar point in its statement, noting that tighter financial and credit conditions would likely crimp spending by households and businesses. Since the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting in September, new data has shown that inflation is continuing to gradually come down. It\u2019s still not clear if it\u2019s coming down fast enough, or if it will continue to decline and get to the 2% annual level the Fed says it wants to see. Projections by members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions about raising or lowering interest rates, show that policymakers think it will take until 2025 or 2026 to get inflation to that level. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply from March 2022 through this summer as it tried to get inflation under control. Inflation had hit 40-year highs in mid-2022, peaking at 9.1% annually. By contrast, that rate was 3.7% in September. Prices for most items haven't come down over that time, but the slower increases have been a relief to some consumers. Wages have been rising faster than inflation lately, which makes it easier for people to afford goods and services. In an ideal scenario, inflation would continue to come down even as the economy keeps growing indefinitely. Markets are concluding that this means interest rates will probably stay high for a long time. However, it remains to be seen if inflation will keep declining the way the Fed wants, or if the central bank will need to raise interest rates further to make sure that happens. So far, the U.S. economy has stayed generally strong even though interest rates have spiked. The job market has also cooled off somewhat, but remains strong as well. That's good news in most cases, but faster economic growth can contribute to greater inflation. Some experts are worried inflation could flare up again and want the Fed to raise rates further to prevent that from happening. The Fed itself is keeping its options open. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has long said that it will be \"data dependent\" and make its decisions based on how circumstances develop. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which tracks futures trading, investors think there's about a 1 in 4 chance that the Fed will raise rates in December during the Federal Open Market Committee's final meeting of the year.

        "title": "Major wind energy developer scraps two big offshore projects",
        "content": "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. \u2014 Wind energy developer Orsted is writing off $4 billion, due largely to the cancellation of two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey whose financial challenges mirror those facing the nascent industry. It added fresh uncertainty to an industry seen by supporters as a way to help end the burning of planet-warming fossil fuels, but derided by opponents as inherently unworkable without massive financial subsidies. The Danish company said Tuesday night it is scrapping its Ocean Wind I and II projects off the coast of southern New Jersey due to problems with supply chains, higher interest rates, and a failure to obtain the amount of tax credits the company wanted. \u201cThese are obviously some very tough decisions,\u201d Mads Nipper, Orsted\u2019s CEO, said on an earnings conference call Wednesday. He said the company, the world\u2019s largest offshore wind developer, decided \u201cto de-risk the most painful part of our portfolio, and that is the U.S.\u201d That statement went straight to the heart about concerns over the financial viability of the offshore wind industry in the northeastern U.S., which is in its infancy but has extensive plans from New England to the Carolinas. Some projects already have been canceled, and many offshore wind developers are seeking better terms from governments with whom they have already contracted. New York rejected such a request two weeks ago. New Jersey approved a tax break for Orsted in July, letting it keep federal tax credits that otherwise would have gone to ratepayers. \u201cWhile periodic local opposition in the U.S. made some headlines, these projects ultimately come down to economics, so higher costs and lower power prices are working against offshore wind,\u201d said Louis Knight, an analyst at Third Bridge, a research firm advising private equity and other businesses. \u201cHigher interest rates are adding to financing costs for these projects. There are other, cheaper ways to develop power in the U.S., most notably with solar and natural gas.\u201d But the main appeal of offshore wind for supporters, including environmentalists, many state governments and the Biden administration is precisely that it is not a fossil fuel business. The hottest Northern Hemisphere summer ever measured hit this year, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the European climate service Copernicus. \u201cThe urgency to transition to clean, renewable energy is an irreversible reality,\u201d read a statement signed Wednesday by nearly 40 environmental, labor and community groups from New Jersey who support offshore wind, including the state\u2019s chapter of the Sierra Club. \u201cIn a world of warming temperatures and extreme weather in likely the hottest year on record, maintaining the status quo of fossil fuel generation is not an option as the cost of climate inaction is undeniably high.\u201d Orsted\u2019s stock price was down over 26% at midday Wednesday. The company said it hopes to re-use some supplies it has already purchased, such as cable and steel, on other projects. Power generated from the Orsted projects was intended to come ashore and connect with the electrical grid at the site of a former coal-fired power plant that was blown up last week. The industry also faces stiff political headwinds, in New Jersey and nationally, most of it from Republicans, who have convinced the U.S. Government Accountability Office to look into the industry. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a Republican who represents the area in southern New Jersey where Orsted\u2019s wind farms would have been built, exulted in the decision to scrap the projects. \u201cDavid defeated Goliath!\u201d he said in a statement late Tuesday night, calling wind farms bad for the economy, the environment and electric customers. Numerous resident groups also opposed the projects, citing similar concerns, and said they do not want to see the ocean horizon dotted with wind turbines. \u201cWithout billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies, these projects never made sense and could not stand on their own,\u201d said Robin Shaffer, a spokesman for Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal opposition groups. Despite the challenges, some wind projects are moving forward. Orsted said it is proceeding with its Revolution Wind project in Connecticut and Rhode Island. In Virginia, a utility\u2019s plans for an enormous wind farm off that state\u2019s coast gained key federal approval Tuesday. Dominion Energy received a favorable \u201crecord of decision\u201d from federal regulators who reviewed the potential environmental impact of its plan to build 176 turbines in the Atlantic, more than 20 miles off Virginia Beach. And New Jersey still has several other offshore wind projects in various stages of development, with four new proposals submitted in August alone. They join the one remaining project of the three originally approved by the state, Atlantic Shores. That is a project by Shell New Energies US and EDF Renewables North America. Atlantic Shores said Wednesday it remains committed to its project, though it hinted in a statement that it, too, is seeking additional help. \u201cWe are actively engaging in conversations with the administration, regulators, and elected leaders across New Jersey to identify viable solutions that will not only preserve the progress made thus far, but also facilitate the successful execution of Atlantic Shores Project 1,\u201d the company said.

The verdict by a federal jury in Kansas City, Missouri, could upend decades-old practices that have allowed real estate agents to boost commissions as home prices and mortgage rates rise, hurting consumers by making housing transactions more expensive. Plaintiffs in the class action included sellers of more than 260,000 homes in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois between 2015 and 2022, who objected to the commissions they were obligated to pay buyers\u2019 brokers. The verdict followed a two-week trial, and the damages award can be tripled under U.S. antitrust law to more than $5.3 billion. \u201cToday was a day of accountability,\u201d said Michael Ketchmark, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. The defendants included Berkshire-owned HomeServices of America and two subsidiaries, as well as the realty Keller Williams. NAR spokesperson Mantill Williams said the trade group plans to appeal, and seek reduced damages. HomeServices said it was disappointed in the verdict and planned to appeal, while Keller Williams spokesperson Darryl Frost said the realty company would consider its options for an appeal. \u201cThis is not the end,\u201d Frost said. Broker compensation in the U.S. has typically been about 5% to 6% of a home\u2019s sales price, with about half paid to a buyer\u2019s broker. Home sellers complained that this model suppressed competition by keeping commissions for buyer brokers in the 2-1/2 to 3% range despite the brokers\u2019 diminishing role, with many buyers able to find homes independently online. Sellers said the arrangement had \u201csevere anticompetitive effects\u201d and made \u201cno economic sense, except for the buyer broker.\u201d The defendants denied wrongdoing, with the NAR saying there was no evidence agents were required to \u201cmake offers of compensation at all, let alone at amounts that stabilize, fix, or raise commissions.\u201d Re/Max and Anywhere Real Estate, whose brands include Century 21, Coldwell Banker and Corcoran, had been defendants but settled before trial, with Re/Max paying $55 million and Anywhere paying $83.5 million, without admitting liability. Shares of real estate brokerages not involved in the verdict closed lower. Re/Max fell 4.4% and Anywhere fell 2.7%, while online brokers Zillow Group and Redfin declined 6.9% and 5.7%, respectively. The U.S. Department of Justice is separately asking a federal appeals court in Washington to let it revive an antitrust probe into the NAR\u2019s practices. ",

        "title": "'Pharmageddon' could close pharmacies as protest spreads",
        "content": "People with prescriptions to fill could run into an unexpected snag over the next couple of days, as hundreds of pharmacists may call out of work to protest working conditions at CVS and Walgreens. Organizers of the \"Pharmageddon\" protest told NBC News that around 900 people in as many as 10 states could participate in the ongoing protest, which started Monday and will end Wednesday. There was no way to independently verify that number. Lannie Duong, a clinical pharmacist based in California, is one of the key organizers of the protests. She said that, along with sickouts and walkouts, members have discussed protesting at the corporate headquarters of Walgreens and CVS, which are in Deerfield, Illinois, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island, respectively. Those protests are scheduled for Wednesday. The protests are that much more notable because the pharmacists don't have a union and aren't asking for better pay. They primarily want their employers to hire more staff to alleviate the workload and to eliminate policies that push them to work faster. They say those conditions are making it more likely they will make a mistake that could harm a patient. Pharmacists and other health care workers have complained about those issues for years, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, which made them worse. But the current pharmacy protests started attracting notice after at least a dozen CVS stores in the Kansas City area refused to show up for work in mid-September. They've spread since then. An operations manager at a Nebraska Walgreens spoke to NBC News about those issues. They manage their store's pharmacy and asked that their name not be used because of worries that the company may retaliate against them. They said the store's sole pharmacist and its pharmacy technicians constantly have to stop what they're doing to cover other jobs within the pharmacy. It's the only way to prevent long lines of annoyed customers, but it's a distracting environment. \"My pharmacist at any point has three or four customers waiting for him to do something with their prescription, whether it be double-checking it or consulting,\" they said. \"Every single one of us is jumping from customer to customer to customer all day long.\" That causes more mistakes, like errors in counting out pills. The operations manager said their store's pharmacy fills about 450 prescriptions in a typical nine-hour day. For about half of those, the pills have to be counted out one by one. They also said the pharmacy technicians usually don't take breaks and, for many years, the operations manager didn't either. They said the increasingly tough working conditions are being combined with meager pay raises. According to the operations manager, their store fills far more prescriptions than it used to, and at the same time, vaccinations have become a bigger and bigger part of the company's business. The manager said they give about 45 vaccinations in a typical eight-hour shift, which translates into 1 every 10 minutes or so. \"It's definitely gone downhill, especially since the pandemic,\" they said. \"I'm tired of leaving the front and going and crying in the pharmacy, drying my tears and then giving people a shot.\" The manager added that their pharmacist supports the protest, but doesn't plan to go on strike. The pharmacy part of the store wouldn't be able to open at all without them. Walgreens said only two pharmacies were closed on Monday and one remained shuttered on Tuesday. The company also said it is listening to employees' concerns and frustrations. \"We recognize the incredible work our pharmacists and technicians do every day and have taken a number of steps in our pharmacies to ensure that our teams can concentrate on providing optimal patient care,\" the company said in a statement. CVS said it was not seeing any \"unusual activity\" connected to store closures or walkouts. It said it has made changes to address some of the past complaints. \"In response to recent feedback from our pharmacy teams, we're making targeted investments to address their key concerns, including enabling teams to schedule additional support as needed, enhancing pharmacist and technician recruitment and hiring, and strengthening pharmacy technician training,\" the company said in a statement. Al Carter, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and a former practicing pharmacist, said drugstores can't control how much they are paid for filling prescriptions. (The payments are made by prescription benefit managers. CVS owns Caremark, a large player in that industry.) But they can control their spending on employees' pay, so they run the tightest ships they can. Employees say it's far too tight, especially with their responsibilities growing, community pharmacies closing, and the three largest U.S. chains all in the process of closing stores. In a news statement Monday, American Pharmacists Association CEO Michael D. Hogue said the group stands with the pharmacists who went on strike. \"For far too long, employers have made the situation worse than it needed to be,\" he wrote, adding that quotas requiring pharmacists to fill a certain number of prescriptions or administer large numbers of vaccinations are destroying their relationships with patients. \"Supervisors who are not pharmacists do not understand the needs of care teams and make unreasonable demands on time-based productivity,\u201d Hogue said. CORRECTION (Nov. 1, 2023, 9:57 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated who owns Caremark, a pharmacy benefits management company.

        "title": "Grand Canyon University, largest for-profit college, fined $37.7 million",
        "content": "The U.S. Education Department is fining Grand Canyon University $37.7 million, saying the for-profit Christian school misrepresented the costs of its doctoral programs. The agency says Grand Canyon University told students that enrolling in the doctoral program would cost $40,000 to $49,000. That was supposed to cover tuition and 60 credit hours. However, the department says, 98% of doctoral students needed more than 60 credit hours to graduate. From 2017 to 2022, the Education Department said, 78% of Grand Canyon students who graduated with doctorates needed five or six three-credit courses. That cost another $10,000 to $12,000, and sometimes more. \"Almost no students are able to complete their doctoral program within the represented number of credits,\" the department said. In many cases, students could not get federal financial aid for those additional courses. The Education Department disclosed the fine in a letter to university President Brian Mueller dated Tuesday. It said the college has until November 20 to request a hearing and contest the fine. In a statement email to NBC News, Grand Canyon University said the government's statements were \"lies\" and called them \"deceptive.\" \"Grand Canyon University categorically denies every accusation in the Department of Education\u2019s statement and will take all measures necessary to defend itself from these false accusations,\" it said. The Phoenix-based college is the country\u2019s largest for-profit college by enrollment, with more than 100,000 students, most of them online, and it received more than $1.1 billion in federal funding under Title VI of the Higher Education Act, primarily for its bachelor\u2019s degree programs. That was more than any other participating school. The Education Department says 7,547 students enrolled in its doctoral programs from Nov. 1, 2018, to Oct. 19, 2023. The government is fining the school $5,000 for its misrepresentations to each of those students. The Department of Education considers Grand Canyon a for-profit college for purposes of federal student aid, which means it has to follow stricter rules than not-for-profit colleges. The university disputes the for-profit classification, and the IRS considers Grand Canyon to be a nonprofit for tax purposes. The letter to Mueller says that in the few instances that Grand Canyon University did disclose that students might have to take additional courses to complete their doctorates, the disclosures were often incomplete or they were buried in fine print or in long documents, and that those rare disclosures did not address its other misrepresentations or explain the cost of the extra courses.

        "title": "White House rolls out proposal to protect retirement security",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House announced Tuesday that the Labor Department will propose a rule to protect retirement security and combat junk fees. If it is finalized, the rule would \"require that financial advisers provide retirement advice in the best interest of the saver, rather than chasing the highest payday,\" according to a White House fact sheet. Because of a \"loophole\" in Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, some financial advisers are paid to recommend specific investment products, leading to conflicts of interest with the savers they are advising, the White House said. The rule is designed to close that loophole and help standardize rules across states that govern advice about buying insurance products. The rule would \u201crequire trusted investment advisers to adhere to high standards of care and loyalty when they make investment recommendations and avoid recommendations that favor their financial and other interests at the expense of retirement savers,\u201d the Labor Department said in a news release. The White House fact sheet said: \u201cAmerica\u2019s families spend a lifetime saving so they can retire with dignity. But junk fees are chipping away at their savings, going to financial advisers with conflicts of interests instead of to American families, and making retirements less secure.\u201d The Federal Trade Commission said junk fees are \"hidden and bogus fees that can harm consumers and undercut honest businesses.\" Tuesday's proposed rule is the latest in a series of moves by the Biden administration to eliminate junk fees. The administration this month proposed a rule that would \"ban businesses from charging hidden and misleading fees and require them to show the full price up front,\" according to a fact sheet. Biden addressed the proposed rule Tuesday afternoon from the White House. \"When a person pays for trusted advice and it comes with a hidden cost, that's what I call a junk fee,\" Biden said. \"And I think it's wrong.\" Biden warned financial advisers who steer clients toward investments that are in the advisers' best interest, rather than the clients': \"I just want you to know, we're watching.\" \"They're putting their self-interest ahead of their clients' best interest, and they're scamming Americans out of hard-earned money,\" he added. \"People should be able to trust that when they get advice from a so-called expert, they're getting real help, not getting ripped off.\" Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a news release: \u201cFor too many workers, the road to lifelong financial security is unnecessarily paved with uncertainty. This rule ensures that savers of all income levels can work confidently with investment professionals to grow their nest egg and prepare for the joyful retirement they deserve. America\u2019s workers and their families should not have excess fees and lost investment returns chipping away at their retirement savings due to the cost of conflicted investment advice.\u201d The proposed rule will be posted to the Labor Department's website Tuesday and include 60 days for public comments, according to the news release.

        "title": "Florida is booming and burning more trash. Residents say it's making them sick.",
        "content": "Like many booming metros, Tampa is finding that more people equals more garbage. In response, officials there are leaning into an approach popular in Florida: Set it on fire. \u201cAll areas that are experiencing growth are going to find issues of capacity\u201d for managing waste, said Jack Mariano, the commissioner of Pasco County, just north of Tampa\u2019s Hillsborough County. \u201cEverybody\u2019s facing: Where are we gonna put the trash?\u201d In September, Pasco authorities approved a $540 million plan to add a fourth boiler to the county\u2019s waste-to-energy facility, or WTE, boosting capacity at the incinerator complex by around 50% while feeding more power \u2014 from a turbine spun by steam heated through garbage burning \u2014 to the electric grid. Authorities plan to tap Inflation Reduction Act funds to offset about $60 million of the project, targeted for completion in summer 2026, Mariano said. The plant is one of three in the Tampa area that process solid waste, but it currently can handle less than two-thirds as much as a nearby Hillsborough WTE and a third the volume of Pinellas County\u2019s to the west, a facility official said. WTEs have been around for decades, but their technology is getting cleaner and safer, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and ongoing research. Regulators have required substantial upgrades over the years, including to the Pasco plant, built in 1989. Many of the facilities are eligible for tax credits expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act, an Energy Department spokesperson said. Justin Roessler, Pasco County\u2019s solid waste and resource recovery director, said the incinerator there already includes \u201crigorous air pollution controls\u201d such as activated-carbon injection to filter harmful gases. The site\u2019s emissions are monitored continuously for anomalies, which are reported to regulators if detected. The expansion plan includes outfitting the boilers with new technology to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, a local official said. When the project is finished, Pasco will boast \u201cthe first waste-to-energy facility in the country to have a CO2 limit in its permit,\u201d Roessler said. \u201cWe are very proud of that.\u201d Still, waste-to-energy plants handle highly hazardous materials, and even the cleanest operations emit federally allowable levels of noxious chemicals formed during combustion. Lately, residents\u2019 concerns over the potential health risks have drawn more scrutiny. Ana Vale relocated her family from Atlanta last year to a home in Doral, Florida, about 20 doors down from Miami-Dade County\u2019s incinerator. About two weeks after moving in, her now-14-year-old daughter began complaining about her skin itching and burning. Soon afterward, a dermatologist diagnosed her with eczema. Then, on Feb. 12, the plant caught fire and burned down, raising Vale\u2019s concerns even further. While recent research has linked environmental toxins, including air pollution, to rising rates of eczema, Vale said her daughter\u2019s doctor didn\u2019t draw any conclusions about the role of the incinerator. But she believes it\u2019s a factor. \u201cWe lived in Atlanta for 12 years, and she never got that diagnosis \u2014 ever,\u201d she said, but acknowledged she has limited ability to seek out specialists. \u201cWe have four kids. If we go to the doctor every time they get sick, it gets crazy.\u201d Vale doesn\u2019t plan to take legal action against any authorities or Covanta, the company that operated the Miami-Dade WTE and runs seven of Florida\u2019s 10 others including Pasco\u2019s, but others have. Everybody\u2019s facing: Where are we gonna put the trash? PASCO COUNTY COMMISSIONER JACK MARIANO A group of residents sued Covanta in March over the Miami-Dade fire, saying it exposed them to health threats or has already made them sick. In June, following a complaint filed last year by the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, the EPA launched a civil rights probe into whether state environmental regulators harmed the health of Black and Latino communities. The Earthjustice complaint alleged those groups are disproportionately likely to live near Florida\u2019s waste incinerators, and that officials made information about their operations difficult to access for people with disabilities or limited English. An EPA spokesperson said the agency, which isn\u2019t scrutinizing Covanta in the matter, couldn\u2019t comment on active investigations. Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection declined to comment. In New York, state environmental authorities are investigating accusations that Covanta\u2019s incinerator in Hempstead, on Long Island, for years dumped toxic ash into a landfill near a predominantly Black neighborhood, with some residents claiming health impacts, Newsday has reported. The area\u2019s school district also faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed this month by a family alleging the plant contributed to their son contracting lymphoma after starting middle school there. He died last year. Covanta isn\u2019t named in that suit, and the company has denied wrongdoing over its ash disposal practices, saying that they were conducted under regulators\u2019 oversight and that no evidence has emerged linking its operations with any health threats. The company\u2019s incinerators often have \u201cthe tallest stack on that skyline in a very heavily industrial area,\u201d making it easy to \u201cpoint the finger at us,\u201d said Covanta area asset manager Patrick Walsh, who oversees the WTEs in Florida\u2019s Pasco, Hillsborough and Lake counties, adding that more in-depth analysis is needed to assess the health accusations. \u201cYou have to compare waste-to-energy to the alternative,\u201d said Joe Kilsheimer, executive director of the Florida WTE Coalition, a group of several South Florida government bodies and Covanta. The state, which touts its capacity to burn more municipal solid waste than any other, saw the fastest population growth in the U.S. last year, driven largely by migrants to greater Tampa. Its densely populated coastal areas have made space for landfills \u2014 which emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 scarce and expensive. You have to compare waste-to-energy to the alternative. JOE KILSHEIMER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FLORIDA WTE COALITION While garbage volumes would typically be expected to fall as the U.S. economy slows and people buy and throw out less, Roessler said, \u201cwe have not seen that in Florida.\u201d Trash haulers picked up nearly 51 million tons of rubbish in 2022 statewide, up from 47 million in 2020 \u2014 an increase akin to almost 90,000 fully loaded semitrailers. Five months after the fire at the Miami-Dade WTE, the county\u2019s sanitation chief resigned after 15 years in leadership there, issuing a warning on his way out: Find somewhere to put all the trash, or halt construction projects in the area to slow waste pile-up. Pasco County is facing a crunch, too, with its residential growth outpacing both Hillsborough\u2019s and Pinellas\u2019. Its WTE is already expected to burn 440,000 tons of garbage this year, nearly 100,000 more than usual, Roessler said. And with the county population up 8% in just the last two years and solid waste volumes up 15% in the last four, households\u2019 annual garbage disposal fees have risen to $100, from $93 last year. Kilsheimer said at least six new WTE builds or expansions are under \u201cactive consideration\u201d across South Florida, including in Broward County, home to Ft. Lauderdale and the state\u2019s most ethnically diverse population \u2014 where municipal solid waste volumes jumped nearly 13% from 2021 to last year. A Covanta spokesperson wouldn\u2019t confirm whether it planned to build or operate more facilities in the state, saying only that \u201cthere\u2019s a significant amount of interest in WTE in other markets in Florida than we are currently in.\u201d But resistance is already percolating. In August, residents of Broward\u2019s Pembroke Pines crammed into a town hall meeting to oppose even the possibility of an incinerator going up in the area. Proponents of the plants point out the energy they generate helps power local communities. The Pasco facility said it produces about 30 megawatts of electricity daily, which it estimates can power 17,000 homes. The expansion is expected to raise that output by about 50%. States\u2019 policies can encourage different ways of handling trash. Earthjustice attorney Dominique Burkhardt said Florida municipalities \u201care very entrenched in burning waste,\u201d but noted alternatives that can cut down on how much garbage winds up in either WTEs or landfills. She pointed to a solar-powered composting plant under development in Baltimore, backed by $4 million in EPA grants, that is set to process 12,000 tons of organic material per year. It comes on the heels of a 2021 state law requiring large food waste producers located near composting facilities to separate their scraps. In Florida, though, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure last year that will issue grants to help cities and towns build more incinerators. Recent efforts to enshrine recycling statutes have died in the Legislature. Meanwhile, local authorities still speak proudly of Florida\u2019s Solid Waste Management Act of 1988, which instigated municipalities\u2019 embrace of WTEs, and of the decadeslong operating contracts that followed. Covanta\u2019s service agreement in Pasco County dates back to that year. Under the latest extensions, it is set to continue through 2034. CORRECTION (Oct. 31, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated some of Earthjustice\u2019s allegations about Florida regulators.

        "title": "'Deny, deny, deny': By rejecting claims, Medicare Advantage plans threaten rural hospitals and patients, CEOs say",
        "content": "For decades, Rose Stone counted on the Alliance HealthCare System in rural Holly Springs, Mississippi, for her medical needs. But after she retired and signed up for a Medicare Advantage plan, she was surprised to learn it didn\u2019t cover her visits to nonprofit Alliance, the only health-care provider within 25 miles. Stone had a choice: use her own money to keep seeing her regular doctor or drive out of town to see a physician she didn\u2019t know but whose costs were covered.  \u201cIt was a mess,\u201d Stone told NBC News. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the doctor because I was going to have to pay out-of-pocket money I didn\u2019t have.\u201d  Some 31 million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans, private-sector alternatives to Medicare introduced in 2003 by Congress to encourage greater efficiency in health care. Just over half of Americans on Medicare are enrolled in one of the plans offered by large insurance companies, including UnitedHealthcare and Humana. Problems are emerging with the plans, however. Last year, a federal audit from 2013 was released showing that 8 of the 10 largest plans had submitted inflated bills to Medicare. As for the quality of care, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a non-partisan agency of Congress, said in a March report that it could not conclude Medicare Advantage plans \u201csystematically provide better quality\u201d over regular Medicare. Even worse, because the plans routinely deny coverage for necessary care, they are threatening the existence of struggling rural hospitals nationwide, CEOs of facilities in six states told NBC News. While the number of older Americans who rely on Medicare Advantage in rural areas continues to rise, these denials force the hospitals to eat the increasing costs of care, causing some to close operations and leave residents without access to treatment. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to reimburse for anything \u2014 deny, deny, deny,\u201d Dr. Kenneth Williams, CEO of Alliance HealthCare, said of Medicare Advantage plans. \u201cThey are taking over Medicare and they are taking advantage of elderly patients.\u201d Williams is something of a local hero in Holly Springs. When the area hospital was in danger of closing in 1999, he marshaled resources and bought it to keep it open. Alliance serves a county with 38,000 people. Still, this spring he had to shut down a long-time geriatric psychiatry program that had served the community for over eight years. Coverage denials from Medicare Advantage plans killed the program, Williams said. Medicare Advantage plans are sold assiduously by celebrity pitchmen \u2014 one is Joe Namath \u2014 as a better way for Americans who qualify for Medicare to get insurance coverage. Many plans add services such as dental and hearing care and wellness programs not offered under traditional Medicare, for which beneficiaries pay extra. The U.S. government pays most of beneficiaries\u2019 premiums to the insurers offering the plans. If the government hoped Medicare Advantage plans would reduce the costs of care, that has not been the outcome. Medicare pays the plans 6 percent more than it would spend if plan enrollees were covered under regular, fee-for-service Medicare, the MedPAC report found. Medicare payments to the plans will total $27 billion more in 2023 than if patients were enrolled in traditional Medicare, the report projected. A new enrollment period for the plans began this month. State insurance commissioners told NBC News they, too, receive many complaints from customers saying they were sold Medicare Advantage plans without understanding their limitations. A major complaint, said Mike Chaney, the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner: \u201cConsumers are not aware their doctors are likely to change under the Medicare Advantage plans.\u201d Medicare Advantage plans have grown in popularity in recent years, with enrollment more than doubling nationwide since 2013. One explanation: The plans are often cheaper than paying for a Medicare supplement, sometimes referred to as Medigap. Another reason for the growth may be the significantly larger commissions the government pays to brokers selling Medicare Advantage plans. In 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid will pay brokers a commission of between $611 and $762 for the first year of a Medicare Advantage plan, depending on the state, and roughly half that on annual renewals. On Medicare supplements, by contrast, brokers receive around $300 on average in year one. Brokers selling the so-called advantage plans aren\u2019t the only ones making money on them. UnitedHealth Group, the largest Medicare Advantage provider with 7.6 million people in its plans, generated $257 billion in premium revenues in 2022, some 13% over the previous year. A significant driver of that growth was its Medicare Advantage plans, the company\u2019s financial filings said. Humana, the next largest provider, counts 5.3 million Medicare Advantage customers; during the six months that ended June 30, almost 80% of Humana\u2019s $51 billion in premium revenues came from individual Medicare Advantage plans, its filings show. Meanwhile, CEOs of rural nonprofit hospital systems in Arkansas, Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota and Texas told NBC News that Medicare Advantage plans repeatedly refuse to reimburse them for the care they provide. Some 170 rural hospitals are at risk of closing in those six states alone, according to a report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a nonprofit advocacy organization. While there are multiple reasons for rural hospitals\u2019 financial woes, coverage denials from Medicare Advantage plans play a big part, said Harold Miller, president of the Center that conducted the study. For years, Medicare Advantage plans had been rare in rural areas, now they are becoming ubiquitous. In 2022, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans grew 13 percent in rural areas versus 7 percent in urban zones, according to the MedPAC report. Mary Beth Donahue, president of the Better Medicare Alliance, an advocacy group that supports Medicare Advantage plans, said in a statement: \u201cWe acknowledge the challenges facing some health systems, but we need to ensure coverage is maintained for millions of seniors. As Medicare Advantage continues to grow, it is essential that hospitals provide access for seniors and people with disabilities who rely on this program.\u201d A UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cOver 6,000 hospitals participate in our UnitedHealthcare network, and we have built collaborative relationships with them to help ensure we are meeting our shared goal of providing quality care to the people we serve.\u201d By law, Medicare Advantage plans are supposed to base their reimbursements on Medicare rules. But there\u2019s room for interpretation, says the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, insurers can use their own clinical criteria to determine whether to authorize or pay for care. A report last year by the department\u2019s Inspector General found that in June 2019, the 15 top Medicare Advantage plans denied authorization for 13 percent of claims that had met Medicare rules. The plans also denied payment for 18 percent of claims that met Medicare coverage and billing rules, the report said. Even when the plans pay, they reimburse providers far less than traditional Medicare, rural hospital CEOs and doctors told NBC News. The plans are effectively rationing health care, these providers said. For example, the hospital officials cited specific cases in which plans take a week to approve care but agree to pay only for a three-night stay; deny coverage after approving it, clawing money back from hospitals; or contend a provider is \u201cout of network\u201d when it isn\u2019t. They also deny routine tests and refuse to pay for rehabilitation, saying patients should go home before their doctors think it\u2019s wise. \u201cAny study we order \u2014 X-ray, CT scan, MRI, stress tests \u2014 they\u2019re going to deny,\u201d said Craig Pendergrass, a doctor at Ozarks Community Hospital, a nonprofit critical access hospital in Gravette, Arkansas, in the northwest corner of the state. \u201cWith straight Medicare we just schedule it.\u201d He estimated that his staff spends one-quarter of each week trying to persuade the plans not to deny the tests or treatment. Large hospital systems with big staffs can dedicate time and energy to fighting claims denials, the American Hospital Association says. Small rural hospitals cannot. In response, some smaller systems are starting to reject Medicare Advantage plans. This summer, Jason Merkley, chief executive of Brookings Health System, a highly rated nonprofit hospital chain in South Dakota, stopped accepting the plans because of coverage denials and pre-authorization problems. Only a small percentage of the system\u2019s patients had Medicare Advantage plans, Merkley told NBC News, but the effort required to battle the denials was considerable. A Humana spokesman provided this statement: \u201cIn our Medicare Advantage hospital contracts, Humana pays rates, on average, that are above fee-for-service Medicare rates. Moreover, the fee-for-service Medicare reimbursement model is focused on patient volume and the quantity of services provided, whereas we are focused on delivering better outcomes for patients.\u201d In mid-September, Samaritan Health Services, a five-hospital system in Oregon, said it ended its contract with UnitedHealthcare, including its Medicare Advantage plans. \u201cUnited Healthcare\u2019s processing of requests and claims has made it difficult for Samaritan to provide timely access to the appropriate care to United\u2019s members,\u201d the system said. Refusing to accept Medicare Advantage plans is not an option for hospitals with many plan customers and whose facilities are the only ones in their rural areas, the CEOs say. If they stopped accepting the plans, their communities would have to forego local health care. \u201cWe\u2019re a system with a proud history of taking all patients, insured or not,\u201d said Paul Taylor, CEO of the 25-bed Ozarks Community Hospital. \u201cBut this makes it really difficult for us to continue to care for at-risk patients. We can\u2019t pay our bills.\u201d Medicare Advantage plans make up 40% of his reimbursements now, up from 20% a few years ago, he said. Taylor recently conducted a two-year study of what his hospital received treating traditional Medicare patients versus what it received from Medicare Advantage plans. He found that the plans paid $4.5 million less than he received under Medicare for the same treatments. That\u2019s roughly what his facility generates in revenues each month. Ozarks Community, which serves approximately 30,000 people, narrowly averted a bankruptcy filing this spring, Taylor said. He is selling assets to stay afloat. In late August, a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Covid arrived at San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center, a 49-bed, level 3 trauma center in Alamosa, Colorado. The nonprofit hospital serves a six-county region in south central Colorado that\u2019s home to about 50,000 people. Roughly the size of Delaware, the area is one of the poorer in the state, said Konnie Martin, San Luis Valley Health\u2019s chief executive. The doctor handling the patient recommended admitting her to the hospital, but her UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan balked. They agreed to pay only for \u201cobservation\u201d of the patient, a lower standard of care that generates much smaller reimbursements. The facility went ahead and treated her as an inpatient for two weeks, a stay that cost $29,458, all of which San Luis Valley Health absorbed, it said. Had the Medicare Advantage plan agreed to cover the claim, it would have paid one-third, the hospital estimated. \u201cThis is the norm \u2014 they push back on people to try to keep them out of the hospital or delay their hospital care,\u201d Martin said. The hospital\u2019s staff has to spend time resubmitting claims, she added, saying: \u201cIt costs us 2 or 3 times the amount of labor and investment to collect on one claim.\u201d Her staff provided documentation of four recent denials of coverage by United Healthcare in one week. The coverage denials the CEOs described to NBC News are similar to those found in last year\u2019s Health and Human Services report. They included erroneous rejections of MRIs and CT scans, paying only for \u201cobservation\u201d rather than inpatient care, denials of long-term acute care, rehab, lab tests and medical equipment. The Inspector General said that \u201chuman error\u201d and \u201csystem processing error\u201d caused most of the denials by Medicare Advantage plans. But the hospital executives NBC News spoke with say they believe the denials are a strategy by insurers to improve their profits by refusing to pay claims. \u201cThis world of medical billing is so automated if you\u2019re denying a claim, you\u2019re doing it intentionally,\u201d said Martin, of San Luis Valley Health. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.  The Cuero Regional Health System, a small hospital in Cuero, Texas, serves a population of 22,000. Its officials say Medicare Advantage plans often deny care based on the insurers\u2019 internal determinations about the type of care required, overruling the physicians handling the cases. When the hospital questions a determination \u2014 called a peer-to-peer review \u2014 officials often have to argue with a physician who doesn\u2019t specialize in the care the patient requires, said Lynn Falcone, its chief executive. A Medicare Advantage plan recently denied a referral to long-term acute care for a patient with sepsis, Falcone said. When the family practice doctor overseeing the case asked for a peer-to-peer review, the insurance company physician defending the denial was an ob-gyn specialist. \u201cA surgeon that delivers babies maybe isn\u2019t used to handling sepsis,\u201d Falcone said.  Sandra Tate of Cuero, Texas, said her family\u2019s Medicare Advantage plan created problems for her family in Feb. 2022. Her husband required physical and respiratory therapy after a 10-day stay in the ICU at Cuero Regional Health, she said; although a previous plan from Humana had paid for this treatment four years earlier, the second request for reimbursement was denied under her new plan from United Healthcare. After arguing with the insurer for 30 minutes, Tate, a former school nurse, said she was never told why. \u201cI pay my Medicare premiums and also my insurance premiums,\u201d Tate told NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Medicare Advantage is not wanting to pay the rural hospitals that are taking care of you.\u201d The UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman said the company could not comment on Tate\u2019s experience unless she signed a waiver; Tate declined to do so. In its financial filings, United Healthcare describes how rates paid by the government on Medicare Advantage plans can fall below what the insurer calls its \u201ccost trends.\u201d To combat these profit pressures, the insurer said, it \u201ccan seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management\u201d and \u201cadjust member benefits.\u201d For eight-and-a-half years, Alliance HealthCare System's inpatient geriatric psychiatry program helped older patients in Holly Springs, Mississippi, with depression and other mental health issues. The 15-bed facility offered group and family therapy as well as an inpatient program that could run from one to three weeks, said Ejerra J. Selma Dukes, its former director.  Medicare always paid for the services, Dukes said. But a few years ago, she started seeing more patients with Medicare Advantage plans declining to pay. The insurers would reject claims for patients with depression and dementia, she said, agreeing to reimburse only for those who were suicidal, paranoid or homicidal. \u201cIt had to be extreme for them to say we will allow you all to bring them in,\u201d Dukes told NBC News. On March 28, the program closed its doors, Dukes said, a result of the denials. \u201cIt was heartbreaking, especially with those who had been dealing with us a long time,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou know you can help, but you can\u2019t bring people in for free.\u201d Meanwhile, Rose Stone is once again receiving care at Alliance HealthCare System. She junked her Medicare Advantage Plan and returned to Medicare, with a supplement. \u201cEverything is fine now,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Autoworkers strike is over as union and GM reach potential deal",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers strike is set to end as the union and General Motors announced a tentative agreement on a new contract Monday. The breakthrough comes just days after similar deals with Ford and Stellantis. The union announced a framework agreement with Ford on Wednesday, followed Saturday by a deal with Stellantis, which makes Ram, Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. The pacts must be approved by local UAW leaders and then ratified by a simple majority of each automaker\u2019s union-represented workers. That process will take several days. About 13,000 UAW members went on strike Sept. 15, following the expiration of their previous contract with the Big Three. That gradually expanded to about 40,000 of the union's 146,000 members walking off the job. That slowed production for each company, with the effects ramping up over time. GM said Tuesday that the strike would reduce its annual pretax profit by $800 million and that it was costing it $200 million per week at the time. If members approve the contracts, they will last 4\u00bd years, through April 30, 2028. Union members will get an 11% initial wage increase and a pay bump of 25% over the course of the deal. The new contract also reinstates cost-of-living adjustments, lets workers reach top wages in three years instead of eight, and protects workers' right to strike over plant closures, among other significantly enhanced benefits. UAW members agreed to give up on cost-of-living adjustments in the wake of the 2007-08 Great Recession, which forced GM and Chrysler to accept government bailouts followed by corporate restructuring. That became a major point of contention in the current talks, with UAW President Shawn Fain saying the automakers were making record profits while their employees struggled with reduced benefits for retirees, lower pay for newer hires and the effects of the worst inflation in 40 years. The result of the talks was a far larger pay increase than the UAW's members had received in the past. The union said the agreement also includes five payments of $500 to union retirees and surviving spouses of union members. \"Record profits mean record contracts,\" Fain often said. In leading his first strike as president, Fain spoke about fighting back against \"corporate greed\" after workers sacrificed to help the car companies survive. That helped cast the strike in political terms. Seeking to bolster his credentials with workers, President Joe Biden accepted Fain's invitation and joined a picket line early in the strike. He was the first sitting president to do so. Other prominent politicians, especially Democrats, also voiced their support. It was the first time UAW members had gone on strike simultaneously at all three companies. In the past, the union had struck at one company to force it to the bargaining table and then pushed the two other leading automakers to accept similar terms. The tactic of starting with a limited strike and gradually expanding was unconventional, as well. Fain, who became president of the autoworkers' union in March, said it was inspired by the union's \"sit down strike\" against GM almost 90 years ago. Fain told specific groups of employees to go on strike with little notice, which made it hard for the auto makers to prepare for the union's actions and had an outsize impact relative to the size of the strike even as most UAW members kept going to work. Workers walked off the job at GM, Ford, and Stellantis' profitable truck and SUV plants not at the beginning of the strike, but closer to its end. The transition to electric vehicles and away from internal combustion engines was also a key area of dispute, as the union accused the Big Three of intending to move jobs out of unionized manufacturing plants and into lower-wage facilities where batteries are made. The union says GM agreed that the new contract will include people who work at those electric battery plants, as well as workers at GM Subsystems. The tentative agreement means GM employees will go back to work, as Ford and Stellantis staffers did after those agreements were announced. CORRECTION (Oct. 30, 2023, 10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how long the contracts would last if UAW members approve them. They would last until April 30, 2028, not April 30, 2024. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried is confronted with his own words as prosecutors question him in criminal fraud trial",
        "content": "Prosecutors cross-examined FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Monday after the former crypto billionaire testified in his own defense. Bankman-Fried is facing decades in prison on seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial is expected to conclude in the next few days. Several times during cross-examination Monday, prosecutors asked Bankman-Fried questions, then displayed exhibits that disputed his answers. In one instance, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he had assured people that Alameda Research played by the same rules as others on the FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried said he was not sure he had done so. The government then showed a tweet where he had directly addressed the topic, then an email where he wrote that the account of Alameda Research, FTX's \"sister\" hedge fund, was like everyone else's. FTX co-founder Gary Wang and senior executive Nishad Singh both testified that Alameda was allowed to have a negative balance and a $65 billion line of credit with FTX. Bankman-Fried completed his testimony for the defense earlier in the day. In that testimony, he tried to rebut charges that were levied against him by FTX insiders like Wang, Singh and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison. For example, Bankman-Fried was asked whether he had received a spreadsheet Ellison prepared that showed seven different versions of Alameda's finances. The prosecution argued that that showed he wanted to mislead investors. He said he did not recall reviewing the sheet even though Google metadata showed he had looked at it in June 2022. He also testified he did not go to the Middle East in October 2022 to raise funds to fill holes in FTX's balance sheet. He said he viewed Alameda and FTX as solvent and made the trip to speak at a conference and meet with investors, regulators and employees. At another point, he was asked about a now-infamous, and since deleted, tweet he sent last Nov. 7: \"FTX is fine. Assets are fine.\" Bankman-Fried said that at the time, he thought that Alameda had some $10 billion in assets and that FTX's balance sheet was fine. \"My view was the exchange was OK and there was no holes in the assets,\" he told the court. However, customers began withdrawing their money faster and faster after some of Alameda's financial liabilities and its close ties to FTX became public. Alameda's assets were cut in half as digital currencies plunged in value. FTX didn't have enough assets available to handle the $4 billion in daily withdrawals. Bankman-Fried testified that the hedge trades the firm had used to protect itself from market downturns did not work. He testified earlier that Ellison did not follow instructions to hedge some of its bets. He also testified that he realized on Nov. 8, 2022, that Alameda Research would have to be shut down. Both FTX and Alameda filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried answered many of prosecutors' questions with short answers like \"Yep\" and \"I don't recall,\" and Judge Lewis Kaplan at times stepped in to direct him to answer the question. He is scheduled to face additional charges at a separate trial in March and has also pleaded not guilty to those allegations. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Auto workers union announces tentative agreement to end strike with Stellantis",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers union and Stellantis say they've reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, leaving General Motors as the only one of the Big Three automakers without a contract with the union. The deal, which still has to be ratified by members, follows a six-week strike by more than 14,000 workers at Stellantis assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio, and at parts warehouses across the nation. \u201cOnce again, we have achieved what just weeks ago we were told was impossible,\u201d UAW President Shawn Fain said in a written statement. \u201cAt Stellantis in particular, we have not only secured a record contract, we have begun to turn the tide in the war on the American working class.\" The tentative agreement is patterned off a 4\u00bd-year agreement reached between the union and Ford on Wednesday, sources previously told CNBC. Employees will return to work while the agreement goes through the ratification process, UAW said in a statement Saturday. \"We look forward to welcoming our 43,000 employees back to work and resuming operations to serve our customers and execute our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to maintain Stellantis\u2019 position at the forefront of innovation,\" Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a written statement Saturday. In a statement Saturday night, GM said it was \"disappointed by the UAW's action in light of the progress we have made.\" \"We have continued to bargain in good faith with the UAW, and our goal remains to reach an agreement as quickly as possible,\" GM said. Around 40,000 UAW members have gone on strike since their last contract with GM, Ford and Stellantis expired on Sept. 15. They shut down dozens of factories along the way, including GM's full-size truck plant in Arlington, Texas, on Tuesday. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video statement Wednesday that the move was part of a step to get negotiations over the finish line. The deal, according to UAW, includes 25% in base wage increases through April 2028, and the starting wage will increase to over $30 an hour. Both the Ford and Stellantis deals include a right to strike over plant closures, according to the union. \"The agreement reinstates major benefits lost during the Great Recession, including Cost-of-Living Allowances and a three-year Wage Progression, as well as killing divisive wage tiers in the union,\" the UAW said in a statement. The agreement will need to be ratified by UAW members before it becomes binding, and that process will take time. On Wednesday night, Fain said a national committee will meet to review the Ford deal on Sunday. Local groups will review it after that, and then members will vote on the proposed contract. Still, the proposal means Ford workers left the picket lines and will soon go back to work. Talks between the union and Stellantis had appeared to be more contentious than those with GM and Ford. Fain repeatedly criticized Stellantis for what he called outsize profits and CEO pay, and on Friday he said on a livestream that the company was trying to \"lowball\" the union before throwing a ream of pages, which he said were Stellantis' proposal, in an office trash can. On Monday, Fain called for workers at Stellantis' Ram 1500 truck plant to go on strike. The company responded that it was \"outraged\" by the move. In a statement Saturday, President Joe Biden, who made history as the first sitting president to appear on a picket line, called the contract \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d \u201cThis contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe final word on this tentative agreement will ultimately come from UAW Stellantis members themselves in the days and weeks to come.\u201d Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Frustrated pharmacists could go on strike in rare protest",
        "content": "Pharmacies are boring. Pharmacies are supposed to be boring. But lately, they might be getting too interesting for comfort. The normally staid business has been shaken awake by a series of nonunion \"wildcat strikes\" over the last few weeks. In incidents scattered around the country, pharmacists have refused to go to work or walked off the job. There are signs that a larger strike is brewing, with more walkouts targeting large chains like Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid in late October and early November. The pharmacists don't have a union, so there is no way to tell how many people might participate or how many locations could be affected. The strikes are unusual in that the strikers aren\u2019t asking their employers for better pay. They\u2019re asking them to hire more staff so their workloads are less overwhelming. They are also seeking better working conditions in many cases. \"It's really about having support to do the job safely,\" Bled Tanoe, a pharmacist in Oklahoma City. She currently works for a hospital pharmacy and formerly worked for Walgreens. Tanoe isn't going on strike herself, but she has been a spokesperson for frustrated pharmacists. She created the hashtag PizzaIsNotWorking in 2021 to criticize the pharmacy chains' response to complaints from staff. More recently she's been calling the potential Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 walkout \"Pharmageddon.\" There are signs a lot of pharmacists are unhappy with the state of the business. In a nonrandomized survey in 2021, the American Pharmacists Association and National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations reported that 74% of 4,482 pharmacy workers said they did not have enough time to safely perform nonclinical work, and 75% said there were not enough other staff, like techs and nurses, to safely perform clinical work. The issue made headlines in late September, when numerous CVS pharmacies in the Kansas City area were shut down. The company soon met with the strikers and said it would address some of their concerns. The pharmacists who organize, strike or speak out are taking some notable risks. Employees in a union usually have a legally protected right to strike, but the pharmacists' employers can fire them for striking or organizing a walkout. A number of factors have combined to ratchet up the tension behind the counter. Pharmacies are offering more services to patients, especially immunizations, which means they are busier. That makes for more frustrated customers. \"This is a nationwide problem that pharmacists have been internally yelling about for years,\" said Amanda Applegate, a licensed pharmacist and director of practice development with the Kansas Pharmacists Association. Her group spoke with some of the people who went on strike in Kansas City. Pharmacist Jennifer Morrow says she worked for CVS from 2013 to 2021. She told NBC News she saw staffing problems from the very beginning, and wasn't able to spend enough time with patients as a result. Over time, Morrow said there was a \"gradual decline\" in which management would repeatedly cut back on the hours for pharmacy technicians, which made it harder to train new hires. That created more work for experienced technicians, who would get burned out and quit. \"What we end up doing is cutting care to our patients. At some point it has to stop,\" she said. Morrow says that when she warned managers that the company was at risk of violating New York state pharmacy staffing regulations, she was demoted. She later quit, and now works at a nonfranchised pharmacy. The potential strike is targeting big chains for a reason. According to Applegate, many pharmacists are also frustrated that those companies have been buying up the small stores where they used to work, or else using their superior size and their insurance and pharmacy benefits management units to put them out of business. She said pharmacists at those stores often feel that their working conditions are deteriorating and their jobs are getting busier. \"There's nothing special about what happened in Kansas City. You just had a group of individuals that reached the end of their rope because they've been asking for these changes from management for years, even pre-Covid,\" she said. And over the last two years, the three biggest drugstore chains have all started closing stores. CVS is in the middle of shuttering 900 locations in three years, while Walgreens said in June that it would close 150 U.S. locations. Rite Aid is closing at least 154 stores, and probably more, as it goes through Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. That means there are fewer locations serving customers, which makes the remaining stores busier. \"When you're moving that quickly you miss a lot of things, and we are the last line of defense until the patient gets the med,\" Morrow said. After leaving CVS, she said she now works at a community pharmacy. \"The difference is beyond night and day,\" Morrow said. \"It took about four months for me to be able to calm down enough to go to the bathroom once a day.\" Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried admits FTX 'sure should have' done more to protect customers' money",
        "content": "Facing decades in prison on fraud and money laundering charges, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried testified in his own defense on Friday. After his attorneys first asked him how FTX protected customers\u2019 assets, they then asked Bankman-Fried if FTX had a risk management department. \u201cWe sure should have,\u201d he answered. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after customers got nervous about its health and began withdrawing their money. It soon emerged that billions of dollars in customers' assets had been transferred to Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund that was FTX's \"sister\" firm. He also testified that he borrowed money from Alameda because he owned the company, and that he saw no reason he could not borrow from its substantial profits. FTX co-founder Gary Wang testified earlier that Bankman-Fried directed him to make the transfer because Bahamian regulators were friendly to him and seemed willing to let Bankman-Fried stay in charge of the company. Bankman-Fried's lawyers say he was acting in good faith and trying to do right by customers. The prosecution rested its case early Thursday morning and the defense began presenting its case shortly after noon Eastern Time. Two other defense witnesses testified before Bankman-Fried did. He then took the stand without the jury present as part of a hearing about what types of evidence would be admissible in court. Bankman-Fried also testified that he never directed former FTX CEO Ryan Salame or former engineering director Nishad Singh to make political donations. He also said he didn't recall an incident where, according to Singh, he asked employees to find a way to make it look like FTX had more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Court filings from Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers show that he also plans to testify that he approved of the transfer of FTX assets to regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, because he believed they would act in customers\u2019 best interests. It's often risky for defendants to testify in their defense in high-profile cases, but Bankman-Fried may not have much to lose. Earlier in the trial, Wang, Singh, and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who also dated Bankman-Fried, all testified for the prosecution. They said that they committed crimes alongside Bankman-Fried, including misleading investors about the financial state of FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research, and stealing $10 billion from FTX customers and giving it to Alameda. Wang, Ellison and Singh have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges and are cooperating with the federal government in the hope they will get lighter sentences. Bankman-Fried is charged with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering that defrauded FTX's customers and Alameda's lenders. His lawyers argue that Bankman-Fried did not defraud anyone, that startups like FTX are complex and often fail, and that the government is looking for someone to blame for customers' losses. Bankman-Fried is expected to finish testifying Monday, and prosecutors are expected to cross-examine him afterward. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "A year after Elon Musk bought Twitter, LGBTQ people say it has become toxic",
        "content": "A year after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finalized his $44 billion purchase of Twitter, some LGBTQ people say the once-hospitable home for community building has turned toxic. Monica Rose, who lives in Toronto, joined Twitter in 2008, just two years after the social media website debuted, and she said that at that time, it was like a \u201ccute little group of friends.\u201d  Rose, a transgender woman, said that most of her Twitter community was also trans and that she interacted with prominent trans activists and followed news about the surge in state legislation targeting transgender people.  But Rose\u2019s feelings about the platform quickly soured, she said, after Musk took it over in October 2022; he later renamed it X. The changes and statements affecting LGBTQ people have come in waves. In November, days after he became Twitter\u2019s owner, Musk boosted a false, anti-gay rumor about Paul Pelosi, the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after an attack at the couple\u2019s home. The same month, he reinstated numerous accounts that the previous Twitter management had suspended, often for anti-LGBTQ harassment, and he began to lay off employees who worked on reducing abuse, such as misinformation and harassment.  In December, he mocked pronoun usage and then smeared a gay former Twitter employee with a false claim that he supported child abuse. He also dissolved Twitter\u2019s Trust and Safety Council, a group of outside advisers for fighting online abuse.  In April, he quietly removed the site\u2019s previous ban on intentionally using the incorrect pronouns or names for transgender people, practices known as misgendering and deadnaming that are offensive and are often used as tools of harassment online.  Then, on June 2, the second day of Pride Month, Musk shared an anti-trans video, propelling it to more than 190 million views. Despite Musk\u2019s repeated jabs at trans people online and his statement in June, which has since been deleted, that he \u201cwill be actively lobbying to criminalize\u201d aspects of trans health care for minors, Musk has at times said he does support trans people. In 2020, he said, \u201cI absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.\u201d  Musk has a trans daughter who has said she does not want to be associated with him \u201cin any way, shape or form.\u201d  Anika Collier Navaroli, a former senior Twitter policy official who helped write the rules that Musk has changed, said Musk seemed not to comprehend that online bullying can lead to harm in the real world.  \u201cHe\u2019s taking us backwards in time,\u201d she said. She left Twitter in 2021 and is now a senior fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \u201cThe work was: We keep people safe. When that gets rolled back, we know the implications of that, which is sometimes life and death.\u201d  Rose said that before Musk\u2019s acquisition, she had faced some anti-trans hate on the platform but that Twitter\u2019s policies at the time allowed her to report it and then Twitter would often remove it and she could block people who harassed her.  After Musk bought the platform, Rose said, she would report accounts she believes would have previously violated its policy against hate speech, but she would receive responses that said there was no violation, and the accounts would remain active. \u201cAnd some of the reports were taking four or five months to get processed,\u201d Rose said.  Eventually, Rose could not keep up with the amount of hate she was facing, and she ultimately left the platform in July, saying it has become a \u201ccesspool.\u201d X\u2019s press office responded to an emailed request for comment with an automated response: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d  In the past year, LGBTQ people running some of the most-followed accounts have abandoned the platform. Elton John, who has over a million followers, announced in December that he would quit because of policy changes allowing misinformation.  \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve tried to use music to bring people together. Yet it saddens me to see how misinformation is now being used to divide our world,\u201d John wrote Dec. 9. He has not posted since, despite a personal appeal from Musk.  A representative for John said he was not available for comment. Ellen DeGeneres, who for years had the crown for the most-retweeted post ever, has not posted to her 75 million followers in six months, even as she remains active on Instagram. A representative for DeGeneres did not respond to a request for comment on X\u2019s current state. George Hahn, an actor, writer and humorist who is gay, is also among those who have given up on X. He has 292,000 followers on the platform but has gradually backed away.  \u201cI hated to leave 300,000 followers. I worked very hard to get to that number, and it\u2019s a community that\u2019s been very good to me,\u201d he said.  But Musk\u2019s boosting of misinformation about Paul Pelosi was the last straw, Hahn said, and he has moved his social media efforts to Threads, the X competitor created by Instagram. He has little hope that Musk will change.  \u201cHe\u2019s not going to wake up and say: \u2018You know, I\u2019ve been a jerk here. I should make some changes.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create any free content that contributes to the business success of that person.\u201d  LGBTQ advocacy groups say anti-LGBTQ hate on the platform is the worst it has ever been, though they are not exactly surprised. In April 2022, just after Twitter\u2019s board of directors agreed to sell the website to Musk, some LGBTQ users and advocates feared that the harassment they already faced on the site would get worse, citing Musk\u2019s views on free speech and his past statements about LGBTQ people. Those fears have largely come true, at least according to anecdotal accounts like Rose\u2019s and research from nonprofit groups.  A report in March found that posts linking the LGBTQ community to \u201cgrooming\u201d \u2014 a false trope based on a decades-old moral panic \u2014 had jumped 119% since Musk took over the platform, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British nonprofit group that combats online hate and disinformation. The report found that five of the accounts with the largest followings that perpetuate the \u201cgroomer\u201d narrative were set to generate $6.4 million a year in ad revenue for the platform.  X Corp., the parent company of X, sued the group in July, arguing that it had orchestrated a \u201cscare campaign to drive away advertisers from the X platform.\u201d The Center for Countering Digital Hate said the move was \u201cstraight out of the authoritarian playbook,\u201d and it said Musk will not \u201cbully us into silence.\u201d The suit is pending.  GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy group, releases an annual Social Media Safety Index and Platform Scorecard that evaluates social media platforms\u2019 policies that ensure safety for LGBTQ users. In its most recent scorecard, published in June, X ranked in last place among the major social media platforms. \u201cThe user safety experience on X/Twitter has steadily declined over the past year \u2014 for LGBTQ people, for all historically marginalized groups, and for everyone, including brands and advertisers who understandably don\u2019t want their ads appearing next to extremist hate content,\u201d a GLAAD spokesperson said in an email.  The spokesperson added that X\u2019s current business model prioritizes \u201cmonetizing user-generated bullying of other users, high profile public figures, and members of the general public.\u201d GLAAD described Musk\u2019s policy changes, including the removal of the ban on targeted misgendering and deadnaming, as \u201cincreasingly reckless\u201d and said Musk has continually elevated anti-trans hate speech, harassment and disinformation by liking, replying to and sharing content from \u201canti-LGBTQ hate accounts.\u201d  The GLAAD spokesperson said the organization has kept sharing content on X to \u201ccontinue reaching and celebrating LGBTQ people,\u201d adding, \u201cOur community is consistently creative and resilient, and we refuse to be silent or erased.\u201d Studying what is happening on Twitter has become much more difficult for outside researchers in the past year after Musk ended free access to the interface researchers used to get data in May.  \u201cElon has shut down essentially all good faith efforts to measure pretty much anything about Twitter,\u201d said Jeremy Blackburn, an associate professor of computer science at Binghamton University in New York.  \u201cThere is no realistic mechanism to acquire Twitter data at the scale sufficient to measure things like hate and extremism,\u201d he said. Though many LGBTQ people have left X because of Musk\u2019s changes, many others have chosen to stay. Alejandra Caraballo, a transgender advocate and clinical instructor at Harvard Law\u2019s Cyberlaw Clinic, said she remains because of the real-life impact of the increase in hateful content.  She mentioned the account Libs of TikTok, which has 2.6 million followers and led an online campaign against children\u2019s hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors. Hospitals in Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and Boston have received bomb threats after the account accused them in posts of \u201cgrooming\u201d or harming children, according to The Washington Post. \u201cThese kinds of hate campaigns are causing real world effects where people are getting death threats, they\u2019re getting bomb threats, they\u2019re getting harassed, doxxed,\u201d Caraballo said. \u201cI myself was getting CC\u2019d on bomb threats that were targeting schools primarily, but anything related to the LGBTQ community. It\u2019s hard to leave in some ways, because I kind of want to know what\u2019s inciting this right now.\u201d Though she believes X has become more unsafe for LGBTQ people, Caraballo said Musk\u2019s allowing hateful content to proliferate has weakened the platform\u2019s power.  \u201cElon Musk doing this to Twitter destroyed the cultural capital that it had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so even though he\u2019s putting the thumb on the scale so heavily towards this far-right, extreme content, because so many people have left, especially prominent people, it no longer carries the weight that it did or influence that it did.\u201d Caraballo has not found another platform that fills the gap left by X, but Rose has turned to Bluesky, an invitation-only website similar to X.  Laurel Powell, the director of communications at the Human Rights Campaign, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, said the organization worked with Twitter before Musk bought it to help develop policies that protected LGBTQ people from misgendering, discrimination and hate speech. Now, Musk has done away with the policy against misgendering and largely disbanded the moderation teams that had helped enforce the anti-discrimination and anti-hate speech policies. \u201cIt was a very useful platform that had an outsize influence on the discourse that\u2019s happening in our society, and now, all that\u2019s out the window, and they\u2019re just failing to do their basic duty to protect LGBTQ+ people, organizations that advocate for LGBTQ+ people and any number of other marginalized groups,\u201d Powell said.

        "title": "U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annual pace in the third quarter, better than expected",
        "content": "The U.S. economy grew even faster than expected in the third quarter, buoyed by a strong consumer in spite of higher interest rates, ongoing inflation pressures, and a variety of other domestic and global headwinds. Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a 4.9% annualized pace in the July-through-September period, up from an unrevised 2.1% pace in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 4.7% acceleration. The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending. Consumer spending, as measured by personal consumption expenditures, increased 4% for the quarter after rising just 0.8% in Q2. Gross private domestic investment surged 8.4% and government spending and investment jumped 4.6%. Spending at the consumer level split fairly evenly between goods and services, with the two measures up 4.8% and 3.6%, respectively. The GDP increase marked the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2021. Markets reacted little to the news, with stock market futures negative heading into the open and Treasury yields mostly lower. While the report could give the Federal Reserve some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week, according to CME Group data. Futures pricing pointed to just a 27% chance of an increase at the December meeting following the GDP release. \u201cInvestors should not be surprised that the consumer was spending in the final months of the summer,\u201d said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \u201cThe real question is if the trend can continue in the coming quarters, and we think not.\u201d In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims totaled 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, up 10,000 from the previous period and slightly ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 207,000. Also, durable goods orders increased 4.7% in September, well ahead of the 0.1% gain in August and the 2% forecast, according to the Commerce Department. At a time when many economists had thought the U.S. would be in the midst of at least a shallow recession, growth has kept pace due to consumer spending that has exceeded all expectations. The consumer was responsible for about 68% of GDP in Q3. Even with Covid-era government transfer payments running out, spending has been strong as households draw down savings and ramp up credit card balances. The gains also come despite the Federal Reserve not only raising rates at the fastest clip since the early 1980s but also vowing to keep rates high until inflation comes back to acceptable levels. Price increases have been running well ahead of the central bank\u2019s 2% annual target, though the rate of inflation at least has ebbed in recent months. The chain-weighted price index, which takes into accounts changes in consumer shopping patterns to gauge inflation, rose 3.5% for the quarter, up from 1.7% in Q2 and higher than the Dow Jones estimate for 2.5%. Along with rates and inflation, consumers have been dealing with a variety of other issues. The resumption of student loan payments is expected to take a bite out of household budgets, while elevated gas prices and a wobbly stock market are hitting confidence levels. Geopolitical tensions also pose potential headaches, with fighting between Israel and Hamas and the war in Ukraine posing substantial uncertainties about the future. While the U.S. has proven resilient to the various challenges, most economists expect growth to slow considerably in the coming months. However, they generally think the U.S. can skirt a recession absent any other unforeseen shocks.

        "title": "Bud Light to return as the UFC's official beer as it recovers from a conservative backlash",
        "content": "Bud Light is set to return as the official beer of the UFC in the U.S. next year as the brand tries to recover from a conservative backlash to a promotion with a transgender influencer. Under a new multiyear marketing deal between the promoter of mixed martial arts fights and Bud Light maker Anheuser-Busch, the brewer will become the UFC\u2019s \u201cOfficial Beer Partner\u201d in the U.S. starting Jan. 1, the two companies announced. Outside the U.S., AB InBev, the parent of Anheuser-Busch, will be UFC\u2019s official global partner. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed \u2014 but, citing a person familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the global agreement marks the UFC\u2019s largest sponsorship ever, surpassing a $175 million fight-kit deal signed with Crypto.com back in 2021. A UFC spokesperson declined to comment on the financial terms of the partnership. Anheuser-Busch did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. This isn\u2019t the first time the UFC and the beer brand have paired up. Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light were UFC\u2019s original beer sponsors more than 15 years ago, UFC CEO Dana White said in a Tuesday statement \u2014 adding that he feels UFC, Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light \u201care very aligned when it comes to our core values.\u201d News of the partnership comes during a rocky year for Anheuser-Busch. The brewer has seen a monthslong sales decline for Bud Light after conservative critics vowed to boycott the brand for sending a commemorative can to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney earlier this year. Bud Light has also faced backlash from Mulvaney\u2019s supporters and LGBTQ rights groups, who say the company didn\u2019t do enough to support her. In June, Bud Light lost its place as America\u2019s best-selling beer after more than two decades, slipping into second place behind Mexican lager Modelo Especial. InBev also owns Modelo, but in the U.S. the brand is imported and sold by Constellation Brands. As Bud Light sales plunged, Anheuser-Busch InBev reported a 10.5% fall in U.S. revenue for this year\u2019s second quarter. Meanwhile, overall its revenue rose 7.2%, to $15.1 billion, from the same period a year ago \u2014 as global brands such as Stella Artois and Corona made up for the loss in Bud Light sales. ",

        "title": "UAW and Ford reach tentative agreement, potentially ending strike at the Big Three automaker",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers union and Ford have agreed in principle to the terms of a tentative agreement that could signal the end to the nearly six-week strike with the Big Three automaker, sources with knowledge of the discussions confirmed Wednesday to CNBC. A tentative agreement could be announced as early as Wednesday night, pending approval of UAW leaders, according to two sources, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. The agreement will need to be ratified by UAW members, thousands of whom have walked off the job at Ford factories throughout the U.S., including its Kentucky Truck Plant, the company's largest factory worldwide. The automaker and the union participated in intense bargaining Tuesday and Wednesday in an attempt to finalize a record deal, the sources said. Spokespeople for Ford declined to comment to CNBC on the negotiations earlier Wednesday other than to say talks were continuing. A UAW spokesman did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. The talks this week involved a proposal for wage increases of at least 25% over the term of the deal, as well as other improved benefits previously outlined by the union and company, two sources confirmed to CNBC. Around 13,000 UAW members went on strike Sept. 15 in an action that hit Ford, General Motors and Stellantis at the same time. The union had never engaged in a simultaneous strike against all three companies. The UAW gradually ramped up those strikes in subsequent weeks, and as of Wednesday, about 40,000 people had walked off the job. That slowly cut into vehicle production and supply lines. In mid-October, the union told workers to strike at plants where highly profitable vehicles like full-size SUVs and trucks were made. They were Kentucky Truck, a Stellantis facility in Sterling Heights, Michigan; and a GM plant in Arlington, Texas. The UAW said those three were the largest manufacturing plant owned by each company. GM said days ago that the strikes were costing it about $200 million a week. In another historic first, President Joe Biden became the first sitting president to walk a picket line when he visited UAW workers in Belleville, Michigan.

        "title": "Live Nation spars with senator over its vow to ditch hidden ticket fees",
        "content": "Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster, pushed back against a senator\u2019s call to expand its rollout of more transparent ticket costs. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sent a letter Wednesday to Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino calling on the entertainment giant to make its new \u201call-in\u201d pricing view a default setting across both Live Nation and Ticketmaster sales platforms. Live Nation pledged in mid-June to show customers \u201cthe total cost from the start\u201d of their online ticket searches beginning in September for events at Live Nation-operated venues \u2014 joining a broader Biden administration effort to reduce so-called junk fees that raise the advertised prices of many consumer products and services. Live Nation criticized Klobuchar\u2019s request as impractical and inaccurate, saying it has already fulfilled its promise to start disclosing \u201call-in\u201d prices at the hundreds of venues it operates, adding that the initial pledge never included all of the thousands of other venues for which Ticketmaster sell tickets. \u201cIf we had the power to do that it would have been part of our commitment to the White House and our June 15 announcement,\u201d a Live Nation spokesperson said. \u201cThis just underscores the importance of all-in pricing legislation,\u201d which the company has supported at the federal level despite failed attempts in Congress to advance it. Speaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Klobuchar called on Live Nation to \u201ckeep your promises and be transparent about how much each ticket costs.\u201d But Live Nation disputed Klobuchar\u2019s characterization of its pledge. A spokesperson said the change applied only to venues it owns and operates. The spokesperson also pointed to a new tool launched this year. Using the feature, Ticketmaster consumers can navigate to the \u201cfilters\u201d menu on the search screen and toggle on an option to \u201cshow prices including fees.\u201d Key to the dispute is the extent of Live Nation\u2019s ability \u2014 or, as Klobuchar sees it, willingness \u2014 to set rules about how prices are displayed for tickets at venues it doesn\u2019t own. \u201cThe existence of this [all-in] filter shows that Live Nation-Ticketmaster has the technical ability to display all-in prices, but chooses not to display that price to consumers as the default setting,\u201d she wrote in her letter, asking Rapino to provide an update on price transparency efforts by Nov. 15. Live Nation responded with its own letter Wednesday, viewed by NBC News, writing, \u201cTicketmaster does not have the unilateral right to do that, as it is an agent for the venues that issue tickets and along with the content owners (artists, sports teams, etc.) determine ticket pricing and how fees are displayed.\u201d But Klobuchar insisted the company could do more for transparency: \u201cThey can show how much the ticket costs, and that\u2019s what they need to do.\u201d Live Nation already displays all-in prices at all venues \u2014 including those it doesn\u2019t operate \u2014 in New York, Connecticut and Tennessee, which have laws requiring such transparency. \u201cIf they are claiming that somehow no one will let them say how much the ticket costs,\u201d Klobuchar said, \u201cno, I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d The Live Nation spokesperson said all-in pricing had already been instituted for all new events listed for sale at venues Live Nation owns and operates as of Sept. 25. But the company confirmed that coming events at those venues that were put on sale before that date don\u2019t display all-in pricing upfront. The Biden administration has pointed to research suggesting that so-called drip pricing, in which extra charges pile up the further a shopper moves through the purchasing process, generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue to sellers in industries from transportation and hospitality to banking and internet services. Administration officials argue the practice makes it harder to comparison-shop and artificially drives up the prices consumers pay, contributing to inflation. Discrepancies between the base price of a ticket and the total after taxes and fees can be considerable on Ticketmaster or Live Nation. For instance, shoppers who don\u2019t find and click the \u201cincluding fees\u201d button would see a box-seat ticket on LiveNation.com for Thursday\u2019s Jessie Murph concert at Boston\u2019s House of Blues, a Live Nation venue, listed at $103 apiece. The event went on sale in June. Only by adding the ticket to their cart, signing in to a Live Nation account and then proceeding with the purchase would they see the total climb to $124.50, because of a \u201cservice fee\u201d and a \u201cprocessing fee\u201d \u2014 a price jump of nearly 21%. CLARIFICATION (Oct. 25, 6:30 p.m.): This article has been updated to clarify that Live Nation, not its Ticketmaster subsidiary, pledged in June to adopt all-in prices and that it was limited to Live Nation operated venues. The article has also been updated to remove references to NBC News\u2019 review of the prevalence of all-in pricing in listings on Live Nation\u2019s website, which did not distinguish between venues operated by Live Nation and those operated by others. It also adds additional statements by Sen. Klobuchar and excerpts from Live Nation\u2019s letter in response.

        "content": "A bear prowling for pre-hibernation snacks raided the kitchen of a luxury Colorado resort and injured a responding security guard, authorities said Tuesday. The late-night food run unfolded around 11 p.m. Monday at the St. Regis Aspen Resort in Aspen when the guard surprised the four-legged intruder in the kitchen, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. The bear attacked and knocked the guard down before the guard got away and called 911, officials said. The guard was taken to the hospital and treated for scratches on his back, and he was released Tuesday. Parks officers got to the resort early Tuesday and learned that \"the bear had entered the hotel through a series of doors near the courtyard,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Wildlife officers were also able to get a description of the bear, including specific identification markers to assist in locating and properly identifying the bear,\" the statement said.  Wildlife officers believe they spotted the animal later Tuesday but said they couldn't \"tranquilize and capture the bear\" because of \"public safety\" concerns. \"This incident serves as an unfortunate reminder that bears are still active as they prepare for hibernation,\" Parks and Wildlife said. \"While it is common for people to see bears and other wildlife inside Aspen town limits, it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to give wildlife space and remember the importance of being 'bear aware' at all times.\" Representatives for Parks and Wildlife and Marriott, the owner of the luxury mountain resort, could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.

        "content": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will take the stand to testify in his own defense, his attorney said in a conference call Wednesday. The decision by his legal team sets him up for a cross-examination by federal prosecutors, who will be able to press him on the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried\u2019s decision to testify came after federal prosecutors and his defense team were able to secure the alleged fraudster an adequate supply of his ADHD medication. His defense had previously argued before the court that inadequate access to the medication impugned his ability to participate in his defense. It is widely considered to be a risky maneuver. While his defense team will be able to question him, and the former billionaire would be able to provide his own narrative as to the collapse, it also opens up Bankman-Fried to a cross-examination by federal prosecutors. So far, the prosecution has called up several of Bankman-Fried\u2019s top executives to testify, including Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, his one-time romantic partner and former CEO of Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried stands accused of fraud and money laundering of his role in the collapse of the multi-billion dollar crypto exchange FTX. Since the company filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has been accused of systematically pilfering billions in customer assets from the exchanges reserves, in order to fund political contributions, real estate acquisitions and high profile sponsorship deals. The government has also presented extensive evidence to support its claims, including Signal chats and internal documents, which prosecutors allege show how Bankman-Fried orchestrated the spending of customer funds.

        "title": "Why Exxon and Chevron are doubling down on fossil fuel energy with big acquisitions",
        "content": "On Monday, Chevron announced plans to acquire oil and gas company Hess for $53 billion in stock. Less than two weeks prior, Exxon Mobil announced it is acquiring oil company Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion in stock. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency released its annual world energy outlook report that projects global demand for coal, oil and natural gas will hit an all-time high by 2030, a prediction the IEA\u2019s executive director Fatih Birol had telegraphed in September. \u201cThe transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it\u2019s unstoppable. It\u2019s not a question of \u2018if,\u2019 it\u2019s just a matter of \u2018how soon\u2019 \u2014 and the sooner the better for all of us,\u201d Birol said in a written statement published alongside his agency\u2019s world outlook. \u201cTaking into account the ongoing strains and volatility in traditional energy markets today, claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world\u2019s energy and climate future look weaker than ever.\u201d But based on their acquisitions, Chevron and Exxon are seemingly preparing for a different world than the IEA is portending. \u201cThe large companies \u2014 nongovernment companies \u2014 do not see an end to oil demand any time in the near future. That\u2019s one of the messages you have to take from this. They are committed to the industry, to production, to reserves and to spending,\u201d Larry J. Goldstein, a former president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation and a trustee with the not-for-profit Energy Policy Research Foundation, told CNBC in a phone conversation Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re in this in the long haul. They don\u2019t see oil demand declining anytime in the near term. And they see oil demand in fairly large volumes existing for at least the next 20, 25 years,\u201d Goldstein told CNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s a major difference between what the big oil companies believe the future of oil is and the governments around the world.\u201d So, too, says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in the energy security and climate change program at the bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization, Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThere are endless debates about when \u2018peak demand\u2019 will occur, but at the moment, global oil consumption is near an all-time high. The largest oil and gas producers in the United States see a long pathway for oil demand,\u201d Cahill told CNBC. Globally, momentum behind and investment in clean energy is increasing. In 2023, there will be $2.8 trillion invested in the global energy markets, according to a prediction from the IEA in May, and $1.7 trillion of that is expected to be in clean technologies, the IEA said. The remainder, a bit more than $1 trillion, will go into fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, the IEA said. Continued demand for oil and gas despite growing momentum in clean energy is due to population growth around the globe and in particular growth of populations \u201cascending the socioeconomic ladder\u201d in Africa, Asia and to some extent Latin America, according to Shon Hiatt at the USC Marshall School of Business. Oil and gas are relatively cheap and easy to move around, particularly in comparison with building new clean energy infrastructure. \u201cThese companies believe in the long-term viability of the oil and gas industry because hydrocarbons remain the most cost-effective and easily transportable and storable energy source,\u201d Hiatt told CNBC. \u201cTheir strategy suggests that in emerging economies marked by population and economic expansion, the adoption of low-carbon energy sources may be prohibitively expensive, while hydrocarbon demand in European and North American markets, although potentially reduced, will remain a significant factor.\u201d Also, while electric vehicles are growing in popularity, they are just one section of the transportation pie, and many of the other sections of the transportation sector will continue to use fossil fuels, said Marianne Kah, senior research scholar and board member at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. Kah was previously the chief economist of ConocoPhillips for 25 years. \u201cWhile there is a lot of media attention given to the increasing penetration of electric passenger vehicles, global oil demand is still expected to grow in the petrochemical, aviation and heavy-duty trucking sectors,\u201d Kah told CNBC. Geopolitical pressures also play a role. Exxon and Chevron are expanding their holdings as European oil and gas majors are more likely to be subject to strict emissions regulations. The U.S. is unlikely to have the political will to force the same kind of stringent regulations on oil and gas companies here. \u201cOne might speculate that Exxon and Chevron are anticipating the European oil majors divesting their global reserves over the next decade due to European policy changes,\u201d Hiatt told CNBC. \u201cThey are also betting domestic politics will not allow the U.S. to take significant new climate policies directed specifically to restrain or limit or ban the level of U.S. oil and gas domestic production,\u201d Amy Myers Jaffe, a research professor at New York University and director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at NYU\u2019s School of Professional Studies, told CNBC.  Goldstein expects the ever-expanding U.S. national debt will eventually put all kinds of government subsidies on the chopping block, which he says will also benefit companies such as Exxon and Chevron. \u201cAll subsidies will be under enormous pressure,\u201d Goldstein said, the intensity of that pressure dependent on which party is in the White House at any given time. \u201cBy the way, that means the large financial oil companies will be able to weather that environment better than the smaller companies.\u201d Also, sanctions of state-controlled oil and gas companies in countries like those in Russia, Venezuela and Iran are providing Exxon and Chevron a geopolitical opening, Jaffe said. \u201cThey likely hope that any geopolitically driven market shortfalls to come can be filled by their own production, even if demand for oil overall is reduced through decarbonization policies around the world,\u201d Jaffe told CNBC. \u201cIf you imagine oil like the game of musical chairs, Exxon Mobil and Chevron are betting that other countries will fall out of the game regardless of the number of chairs and that there will be enough chairs left for the American firms to sit down, each time the music stops.\u201d Known oil reserves are increasingly valuable as European and American governments look to limit the exploration for new oil and gas reserves, according to Hiatt. \u201cNotably, both Pioneer and Hess possess attractive, well-established oil and gas reserves that offer the potential for significant expansion and diversification for Exxon and Chevron,\u201d Hiatt told CNBC. Oil and gas reserves that can be brought to market relatively quickly \u201care the ideal candidates for production when there is uncertainty about the pace of the energy transition,\u201d Kah told CNBC, which explains Exxon\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer, which gave Exxon more access to \u201ctight oil,\u201d or oil found in shale rock, in the Permian basin. Shale is a kind of porous rock that can hold natural gas and oil. It\u2019s accessed with hydraulic fracking, which involves shooting water mixed with sand into the ground to release the fossil fuel reserves held therein. Hydrocarbon reserves found in shale can be brought to market between six months and a year, where exploring for new reserves in offshore deep water can take five to seven years to tap, Jaffe told CNBC. \u201cChevron and Exxon Mobil are looking to reduce their costs and lower execution risk through increasing the share of short cycle U.S. shale reserves in their portfolio,\u201d Jaffe said. Having reserves that are easier to bring to market gives oil and gas companies increased ability to be responsive to swings in the price of oil and gas. \u201cThat flexibility is attractive in today\u2019s volatile price climate,\u201d Jaffe told CNBC. Chevron\u2019s purchase of Hess also gives Chevron access in Guyana, a country in South America, which Jaffe also says is desirable because it is \u201ca low cost, close to home prolific production region.\u201d Catherine Clifford covers climate innovation and technology for CNBC.

        "title": "What to know about travel safety as the Israel-Hamas war continues",
        "content": "Last Thursday the State Department advised travelers from the U.S. to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d worldwide because of the Israel-Hamas war, citing \u201cthe potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests.\u201d The warning \u201cmeans what it says,\u201d said Jeffrey Price, an aviation security expert and professor of aviation and aerospace science at Metropolitan State University of Denver. \u201cDon\u2019t go to areas where they are actively capturing or killing U.S. citizens, and be careful when going to countries where you could be put in harm\u2019s way simply by being there.\u201d  But what about trips to Barcelona or Singapore or even just Baton Rouge? Here\u2019s what to consider if you\u2019ve got travel plans on the books or are making them now, given the conflict in the Middle East. In addition to telling U.S. travelers to reconsider travel to Israel and the West Bank and to avoid any travel to Gaza, federal officials also recommend staying especially alert in popular locations anywhere tourists gather globally. They suggest following State Department accounts on social media for updates and joining the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to make it easier for the agency get in touch with American travelers abroad in case of emergencies. The State Department has alerts of various levels in effect for many countries because of conflict and other risk factors, but \u201cworldwide caution\u201d advisories are less common. The last one was issued in August 2022 after a U.S. drone strike killed a high-level Al Qaeda leader. Some national security experts regard last week\u2019s global alert \u201cas one of the most urgent issued in light of the extremely high tensions throughout the Middle East,\u201d said Howard Stoffer, a professor of international affairs at the University of New Haven and a former senior official in the State Department\u2019s Foreign Service. \u201cThis type of alert usually lasts a relatively short time,\u201d he said, but the current one \u201cmay last for some period of time.\u201d If you\u2019re planning upcoming travel, you can monitor the State Department\u2019s travel advisories for any destinations on your itinerary both before and during your trip. The Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank, also maintains an interactive Global Conflict Tracker that provides additional information for specific areas around the world. Stay alert and listen to the news carefully when out there. HOWARD STOFFER, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN Experts warn against slipping so deeply into vacation mode that you risk losing sight of potential shifts in the political or security situation on the ground. \u201cBe aware of your surroundings and be sure to cooperate with any increased security measures,\u201d Price said. Stoffer said, \u201cStay alert and listen to the news carefully when out there.\u201d Otherwise, exercise the same good judgment you would under any other circumstances, like steering clear of major protests and making sure friends and family back home know where you are. Israeli flag carrier El Al Airlines is the only airline that continues to fly between the U.S. and Israel, although its website notes that \u201cthere may be a change in the departure times of some flights.\u201d Major U.S.-based airlines that previously offered regular service to Tel Aviv, including American, Delta and United, have issued travel alerts for the Middle East and suspended all flights to Israel. United has also issued a travel alert for its flights to Amman, Jordan, but service there is continuing. The suspensions include direct flights out of major hubs such as Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., as well as connecting flights on partner airlines, said Scott Keyes of the flight deal website Going. In general, travelers who booked to Israel on U.S. carriers on or before Oct. 6, the day before Hamas attacked Israel, are typically being offered the option to either cancel their trips and request refunds or to rebook in the same cabin and between the same cities on different dates with no change fees or fare differences. (United is also offering to waive change fees on flights to Amman.) \u201cThese waivers apply regardless of what fare class you\u2019ve booked,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cEven otherwise restrictive basic economy tickets may be rescheduled or canceled for a full cash refund.\u201d Right now, the rebooking options are available through Dec. 31 on United, from Dec. 5 through Jan. 31 on American and through Sept. 6, 2024, on Delta. Travelers can expect to see a larger law enforcement and canine presence. TSA SPOKESPERSON ROBERT LANGSTON With Delta having already extended the dates of its rebooking provisions, Keyes said, \u201cit\u2019s all but certain other U.S. airlines will extend their travel waivers for at least as long as the escalated hostilities continue.\u201d At airports and other transportation hubs, \u201ctravelers can expect to see a larger law enforcement and canine presence,\u201d said Robert Langston, a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA is operating at a \u201cheightened level of security as a result of world events and the current threat environment,\u201d he said. Officials there and at its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, will continue to monitor the situation and adjust their security measures as needed. Security checkpoints lines at airports could get longer because of the increased measures, Price said, but \u201cif things are getting out of hand, TSA can also speed up lines by reducing random checks.\u201d A handful of cruise lines have made changes to scheduled sailings in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, said Aaron Saunders, a senior editor at Cruise Critic. \u201cThe changes range from the cancellation of full sailing seasons to adjustments to itineraries that remove select ports,\u201d he said.  Windstar Cruises, Royal Caribbean and MSC are among the cruise lines that have pulled all their ships out of the region because of the conflict, Cruise Critic has reported, while Norwegian Cruise Line has informed passengers on a coming Rome-to-Athens cruise that stops in Israel will be skipped. \u201cCruise lines have teams dedicated to monitoring the latest news and updates and reserve the right to adjust their plans as they see most fit,\u201d Saunders said. He encourages anyone with a cruise reservation to watch for emails from the operator for updates on specific sailings, as well as any compensation being offered for significantly affected ones. For those considering a cruise to the region, \u201cwe strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance,\u201d Saunders added. Many travel insurance policies already provide cancellation and interruption benefits in the event a terrorist attack affects a trip, according to published guidelines from the travel insurance comparison platform SquareMouth. But in most cases, those benefits kick in only for policies purchased before the date of the attack, meaning such coverage would apply for the current conflict only on insurance taken out on or before Oct. 6. Travelers with coming trips to Israel who have cancellation and interruption benefits may be reimbursed for 100% of their trip expenses if they need to cancel, SquareMouth noted. Travelers planning to visit Israel as part of trips may also be covered if they need to cut their itineraries short. Harriet Baskas is an NBC News contributor who writes about travel and the arts. ",

        "title": "Autoworkers strike expands again with walkout at GM SUV plant",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers union expanded its strike against Detroit's Big Three for the second consecutive day as members at a major General Motors manufacturing plant walked off the job. The union said 5,000 employees from the Arlington Assembly plant in Texas are now on strike. All of GM's full-size internal combustion SUVs are worked on at that facility, including the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, GMC Yukon and Yukon XL, and Cadillac Escalade and Escalade-V. The move comes the same day General Motors reported its third-quarter results. The company said the strike has cost it around $800 million in pretax profits and it withdrew its 2023 profit forecast, but its quarterly adjusted earnings and revenue were better than Wall Street analysts had expected. The expansion of the strike comes one day after 6,800 Stellantis employees walked off the job, shutting down manufacturing at a facility where Ram 1500 trucks are made. In a statement, GM said it was \"disappointed\" by the step. \u201cLast week, we provided a comprehensive offer to the UAW that increased the already substantial and historic offers we have made by approximately 25% in total value,\u201d the company said. It's another escalation in the union's strike against GM, Stellantis and Ford. The union previously ordered a walkout on Oct. 11, when it struck against Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant. Full-size SUVs and pickup trucks are some of the highest-priced and most profitable products that the Big Three make. They are also some of the most popular vehicles among U.S. consumers. In the early weeks of the labor stoppage, the UAW had been calling on additional workers to go on strike once per week and was giving the automakers more notice about potential strikes. It also did not strike those truck and SUV plants initially. The strike is now more than five weeks old, and the union appears to be moving at a faster pace to push the companies to complete a new contract. Around 45,000 UAW members are now on strike out of a total of 146,000. They\u2019re seeking annual pay raises of more than 40% over a four-year contract, a shorter workweek, improved pensions for retirees, better health care, cost-of-living adjustments and an end to wage and benefit tiers. The automakers have offered record contracts with pay increases of around 20%, as well as bonuses and other improved benefits. The strike began on Sept. 15, after the contract between the union and the Big Three expired. It's the first time the UAW has gone on strike against all three leading U.S. automakers at the same time. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Family sues Panera Bread after college student who drank Charged Lemonade dies",
        "content": "An Ivy League student with a heart condition died after she drank Panera Bread\u2019s Charged Lemonade, a large cup of which contains more caffeine than cans of Red Bull and Monster energy drinks combined, according to a lawsuit. The legal complaint, which was filed Monday morning in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and was first obtained by NBC News, calls the beverage a \u201cdangerous energy drink\u201d and argues that Panera failed to appropriately warn consumers about its ingredients.  The suit was filed on behalf of the parents of Sarah Katz, 21, a University of Pennsylvania student who had taught CPR in underserved communities and had been a research assistant at a children\u2019s hospital. Katz had a heart condition called long QT syndrome type 1 and avoided energy drinks at the recommendation of her doctors, according to the filing.  In a statement Monday afternoon, a Panera spokesperson said: \u201cWe were very saddened to learn this morning about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz, and our hearts go out to her family. At Panera, we strongly believe in transparency around our ingredients. We will work quickly to thoroughly investigate this matter.\u201d Katz bought a Charged Lemonade from a Panera Bread restaurant in Philadelphia on Sept. 10, 2022, according to the suit. She went into cardiac arrest hours later, said her roommate and close friend, Victoria Rose Conroy. \u201cShe was very, very vigilant about what she needed to do to keep herself safe,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cI guarantee if Sarah had known how much caffeine this was, she never would have touched it with a 10-foot pole.\u201d The Charged Lemonade was \u201coffered side-by-side with all of Panera\u2019s non-caffeinated and/or less caffeinated drinks\u201d and was advertised as a \u201cplant-based and clean\u201d beverage that contained as much caffeine as the restaurant\u2019s dark roast coffee, according to photos of both the menu and beverage dispensers in the store, which were included in the wrongful death lawsuit.  But at 390 milligrams, the large Charged Lemonade has more caffeine than any size of Panera\u2019s dark roast coffee, the complaint says \u2014 numbers that the nutrition facts on Panera\u2019s website confirm. It also has guarana extract, another stimulant, as well as the equivalent of nearly 30 teaspoons of sugar, the complaint continues, adding that 390 milligrams of caffeine is higher than the caffeine content of standard cans of Red Bull and Monster energy drinks combined. Katz had gotten the large cup, which is 30 fluid ounces, according to the attorney representing her family.   \u201cI think everyone thinks lemonade is safe. And really, this isn\u2019t lemonade at all. It\u2019s an energy drink that has lemon flavor,\u201d said Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC. \u201cIt should have an adequate warning.\u201d The lawsuit alleges the Charged Lemonade is \u201cdefective in design because it is a dangerous energy drink.\u201d \u201cThese unregulated beverages include no warning of any potentially dangerous effects, even the life-threatening effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and/or brain function,\u201d it says. Conroy described Katz as an excellent student and \u201cthe most involved and passionate person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d someone who would smile and wave to everyone on campus. She was careful to tell people that she could not consume energy drinks and made other modifications for her health condition, but she \u201cnever let it stop her from achieving the things that she wanted to do,\u201d Conroy said. Katz was diagnosed with long QT syndrome at age 5, Crawford said. The American Heart Association describes long QT as a disorder of the heart\u2019s electrical system that can cause abnormal heart rhythms as a result of exercise or stress; it can be well-managed with medication. In addition to medication, Katz\u2019s condition was controlled by regular doctor visits, where \u201ceverything was always normal,\u201d Crawford said.  About 1 in 2,000 people have congenital long QT syndrome, with some showing no symptoms and others fainting or experiencing heart palpitations in response to triggers such as exercise or being startled, said Dr. Charles Berul, an electrophysiologist at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington.  Berul, who did not treat Katz and is not involved in the lawsuit, said caffeine is allowable in moderation for long QT patients.  \u201cWe tell people not to worry, it\u2019s fine to have a Coke or a small coffee each day,\u201d said Berul, who is on the board of trustees of the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes Foundation, an advocacy organization for those with heart rhythm abnormalities.  \u201cBut some of the smaller studies have shown that energy drinks, drinks that have caffeine plus other ingredients like taurine, other things, might be a little riskier,\u201d Berul said. The lawsuit says Katz bought an Unlimited Sip Club membership from Panera, which allows customers to pay a monthly fee for unlimited drinks, about a week and a half before she died. Conroy said Katz had bought at least one other Charged Lemonade in the days before her cardiac arrest. On the day of her death, Katz bought a Charged Lemonade and collapsed several hours later at a birthday gathering for a friend at a restaurant, Conroy said. Emergency personnel took her to the hospital, where she went into cardiac arrest again, this time fatally, the lawsuit says.  \u201cShe was taken from us so soon, and she shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cShe had so much more to give.\u201d  A medical examiner\u2019s report that Crawford shared with NBC News showed that Katz\u2019s cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia due to long QT syndrome. The report does not mention the beverage as a contributing factor but notes that she had no drugs in her system other than what the hospital used to try to resuscitate her.  Caffeine can have health consequences for people beyond those with long QT syndrome and other heart disorders. Large amounts can also pose risks to people with other underlying conditions, as well as to pregnant or breastfeeding people and to children, the Food and Drug Administration says. According to Panera\u2019s website, the caffeine content of its Charged Lemonade ranges from 260 milligrams in the regular size to 390 milligrams in the large, 30-ounce size, while the caffeine content of its dark roast coffee ranges from 161 milligrams in a small cup to 268 milligrams in a large cup, which is 20 fluid ounces. Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade has attracted attention on social media. In December, a customer who said she did not know how caffeinated the drink was shared a viral TikTok video of herself after she had consumed free refills of the mango yuzu Charged Lemonade and captioned the video, \u201cthis drink should come with a warning because it\u2019s delicious and will lead to my cardiac arrest.\u201d  On its website, Panera refers to its Charged Lemonades as \u201cthe ultimate energy drink,\u201d although the lawsuit alleges that it was not advertised as such in-store at the time of Katz\u2019s death. It is not clear how long that description has been used on the site. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to market it that way and know it\u2019s energy drink, how can you not market it that way in the actual store?\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThe reasonable consumer is not going to go onto the website to compare it to see whether or not there\u2019s any additional information.\u201d Katz\u2019s parents, who declined to speak about the lawsuit, are desperate for people to understand exactly what is in Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade before they buy it, Crawford said. \u201cThat has become their most important thing, is making the public aware of these dangers to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to someone else,\u201d she said.

        "title": "UAW strike expands again as union says it shut down Ram truck plant",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers union says it expanded its strike again Monday, as 6,800 people stopped working at a plant that makes Ram 1500 trucks. That means this expansion of the strike targets one of Stellantis' most important and profitable vehicles. The union took a similar step with its last walkout, when it shut down a Ford plant in Kentucky where several F-Series Super Duty pickups are made. The move comes days after UAW President Shawn Fain repeatedly criticized Stellantis, the company that makes Ram, Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. In a Facebook Live broadcast Friday, he said Stellantis \"is trying to lowball and undercut us\" with contract proposals that were significantly weaker than those offered by Ford and General Motors. He also said that the company proposed cuts to employees' medical coverage and to 401(k) contributions and that it wanted the right to demand new concessions from workers before the next contract expires. In a statement Friday, Stellantis said negotiations with the union have been productive without discussing specifics. After Monday's strike, however, the company said it was \"outraged\" by the union's latest step. \"Last Thursday morning, Stellantis presented a new, improved offer to the UAW, including 23% wage increases over the life of the contract, nearly a 50% increase in our contributions to the retirement savings plan, and additional job security protections for our employees,\" it said, saying the union had not given it a counteroffer since those latest talks. The strike at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant on Monday is the latest step in a labor dispute that has been different from most others in Detroit history. It's the first contract negotiation since Fain, who was sworn into office in March, was elected union president in an upset over incumbent Ray Curry. Fain is the first UAW president elected directly by members. He'd run on an anti-corruption platform and used more strident anti-corporate rhetoric than his predecessors. About 40,000 UAW workers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis are now on strike. They're seeking annual pay raises of more than 40% over a four-year contract, a shorter workweek, improved pensions for retirees, better health care, cost-of-living adjustments and an end to wage tiers. The automakers have offered record contracts with pay increases of around 20% as well as bonuses and other improved benefits. The strike began Sept. 15, when, for the first time, UAW members simultaneously walked off the job at all three companies. Since then, the union has employed a phased strategy that it calls a \"stand up strike,\" where workers at specific manufacturing plants are told to go on strike with about two hours' notice, making it harder for the automakers to prepare for interruptions in their production and supply lines. The union has used that approach to play the companies against one another, exempting companies from further strikes when they make more concessions or, as it did Monday, punishing them with new strikes when it says their offers are insufficient. It also makes it easier for the union to stay on strike for longer. Like many unions, the UAW provides \"strike pay\" to people who won't earn a paycheck because they've walked off the job. Members get $100 a day in assistance for each day they're on strike. That doesn't make up for all their lost pay. The union started with more than $800 million in its strike fund, which was enough to provide about 11 weeks of strike pay for all 146,000 members. But more than a month into the strike, it hasn't had to pay out much of that total. With 40,000 workers on strike, it is expected that the union will be paying about $20 million a week from that fund. While the automakers' bottom lines have taken a hit, the impact on them has also been smaller than it would have been if more workers walked out. Last week, Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford said the strike is a threat to both his company and the U.S. auto industry. In remarks that illustrated their differing points of view and rhetorical styles, Ford said in a news conference that \"this should not be Ford versus the UAW. It should be Ford and the UAW versus Toyota and Honda, Tesla and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home market.\" Later that day, Fain countered that \"it's not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It\u2019s autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed.\" Close to 5,000 employees at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles, have also been laid off. The automakers have said that's necessary because there is no work for those people to do, while the union has described it as a pressure tactic. Auto parts suppliers have reported laying off workers as well. The current strike is now stretching a bit longer than the 2019 strike that hit General Motors, which lasted 31 days before the two sides reached a tentative contract agreement. Some of the UAW's past strikes have lasted several months. CORRECTION (Oct. 23, 2023, 11:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of a former UAW president.

        "title": "White House announces 31 tech hubs to focus on AI, clean energy and more",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House announced Monday it is designating 31 technology hubs to improve American competitiveness in the technology sector. The hubs will be able to compete for $40 million to $75 million apiece in grants, the White House said. A tech hub designation is \"a strong endorsement of a region\u2019s plan to supercharge a critical technology ecosystem and become a global leader over the next decade,\" the U.S. Economic Development Administration said on its website. President Joe Biden said in his scheduled remarks Monday afternoon: \"These tech hubs will be transformational, and they're part of a long line of transformational investments we've made since I took office. And as a result, I truly believe this country is about to take off, because for the first time in a long time, we're investing in America.\" The move was authorized under the CHIPS and Science Act, the White House said, which Biden frequently touts as a highlight of his economic agenda. The act, which he signed in August 2022, aimed to improve semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains in the U.S. It also authorized $10 billion to invest in technology hubs nationwide, according to the administration. \"These Tech Hubs will catalyze investment in technologies critical to economic growth, national security, and job creation, and will help communities across the country become centers of innovation critical to American competitiveness,\" the White House said in a news release. The hubs focus on a wide variety of technological areas, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, clean energy, medicine and biotechnology. The hubs are in 32 states and Puerto Rico, and they include areas with tribal governments, coal communities and states with smaller populations, the Economic Development Administration said. The designations \"will be a widely recognized indicator of each region\u2019s potential for rapid economic growth on the basis of their technological strength, and we believe will make it even more attractive to private investment and job creation,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Sunday on a call with reporters. \"The designations reflect the diversity of our country. Many of our hubs include small cities, rural areas, historically underserved communities.\" The White House release said that \"for too long, economic growth and opportunity has clustered in a few cities on the coasts,\" adding that the hubs announced Monday were chosen to \"represent the full diversity of America.\" About six minutes into his remarks on Bidenomics, Biden said he had to go to the Situation Room \u201cwith another issue.\u201d The remarks took place as Hamas reportedly released two more hostages after its attack on Israel on Oct. 7. After his remarks, Biden responded to a reporter\u2019s shouted question about a cease-fire, saying, \u201cWe should have a cease-fire.\u201d \u201cNot a cease-fire,\u201d he corrected himself. \u201cWe should have those hostages released, and then we can talk.\u201d Megan Lebowitz is based in the Washington bureau.

        "title": "Chevron is buying Hess for $53 billion amid uncertainty in oil markets",
        "content": "Chevron is buying Hess Corp. for $53 billion and it\u2019s not even the biggest acquisition in the energy sector this month as major producers seize the initiative while oil prices surge. Crude prices rose sharply in early 2022 with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and are hovering around $90 per barrel after ticking another 9% higher this year, meaning big drillers are flush with cash and looking for places to invest piles of cash. The Chevron-Hess deal comes less than two weeks after Exxon Mobil said that it would acquire Pioneer Natural Resources for about $60 billion. Upward pressure on oil prices are being applied from a number of fronts including the war in Ukraine. Oil markets are being stretched by cutbacks in oil production from Saudi Arabia and Russia, and now, a war between Israel and Hamas runs the risk of igniting a broader conflict in the Middle East. While attacks on Israel do not disrupt global oil supply, according to an analysis by the U.S Energy Information Administration, \u201cthey raise the potential for oil supply disruptions and higher oil prices.\u201d Chevron said Monday that the acquisition of Hess adds a major oil field in Guyana as well as shale properties in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota. Guyana is a South American country of 791,000 people that is poised to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest offshore oil producer, placing it ahead of Qatar, the United States, Mexico and Norway. It has become a major producer in recent years with oil giants, including Exxon Mobil, China\u2019s CNOOC, and also Hess, squared off in a heated competition for highly lucrative oil fields in northern South America. \u201cThis combination is aligned with our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon,\u201d Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said in prepared remarks. \u201cIn addition, Hess increases Chevron\u2019s estimated production and free cash flow growth rates over the next five years, and is expected to extend our growth profile into the next decade supporting our plans to increase our peer-leading dividend growth and share repurchases.\u201d Chevron is paying for Hess with stock. Hess shareholders will receive 1.0250 shares of Chevron for each Hess share. Including debt, Chevron valued the deal at $60 billion. And even with alarms being raised over climate change after a summer of record-smashing temperatures, elevated energy prices have driven more exploration and more drilling, and big payouts for investors. Last month, Britain gave the go-ahead for a major oil and gas project in the North Sea, ignoring warnings from scientists and the United Nations that countries must stop developing new fossil fuel resources if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change. Chevron said the deal will help to increase the amount of cash given back to shareholders. The company anticipates that in January it will be able to recommend boosting its first-quarter dividend by 8% to $1.63. This would still need board approval. The company also expects to increase stock buybacks by $2.5 billion to the top end of its guidance range of $20 billion per year once the transaction closes. The boards of both Chevron and Hess have approved the deal announced Monday after six months of negotiations and is targeted to close in the first half of next year. It still needs approval by Hess shareholders. John Hess, the company\u2019s CEO, is expected to join Chevron\u2019s board. His family owns a large chunk of Hess. Shares of Chevron Corp., based in San, Ramon, California, declined more than 2% before the opening bell Monday. Share of Hess Corp., based in New York City, rose slightly. ",

        "title": "Abortion bans and anti-LGBTQ laws are complicating business travel",
        "content": "Business travel is clawing its way back to 2019 levels as Covid-19 concerns largely recede. But as tighter abortion restrictions and anti-LGBTQ laws proliferate, some employers and event organizers are weighing a new set of threats to employees\u2019 safety outside the office. Dozens of states have slashed abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and more than 180 bills restricting LGBTQ rights are advancing in statehouses nationwide. Many such moves have drawn criticism on political and civil rights grounds, with companies and event organizers threatening state boycotts akin to the one that led North Carolina to scrap its 2016 anti-transgender bathroom law. But lately, conservative \u201canti-woke\u201d messaging has made many companies more hesitant to publicly ally themselves with progressive causes. Some are now taking a quieter approach to mitigating risks, business travel planners and human resources experts say. \u201cWe think critically about who we are sending where and ask employees if they\u2019re comfortable going to a state that has demonstrated they are not inclusive towards people with certain identities,\u201d said Cierra Gross, CEO of Caged Bird HR, a consultancy firm. \u201cWe could be putting someone\u2019s physical and psychological safety on the line in some of these states.\u201d We think critically about who we are sending where and ask employees if they\u2019re comfortable going. CIERRA GROSS, CEO OF CAGED BIRD HR While civil rights groups (and the Canadian government) have issued advisories warning of risks from the legislation, some travel industry groups and local advocates have pushed back against boycotts, arguing they hurt hospitality workers and minority businesses owners and rarely change policies. Last month, California lawmakers voted to repeal a ban on state workers using public funds to travel to 26 states with anti-LGBTQ policies, replacing it with a public awareness campaign. In an April survey, the expense platform SAP Concur found 82% of LGBTQ+ business travelers had changed accommodations at least once in the past 12 months because they felt unsafe, compared with 70% of U.S. business travelers overall and 53% of those globally. For many workers, these concerns are nothing new \u2014 many have long had to be extra mindful of their safety with little to no employer support. For companies and travel managers, though, there\u2019s now a growing \u201csense of importance and urgency\u201d to revisit their policies, said Charlie Sultan, president of Concur Travel. The last time that happened on a broad scale was when Covid-19 hit, pushing business to review the policies supporting what\u2019s known as their \u201cduty of care\u201d to keep employees safe on the job. While most businesses now have protocols to handle Covid exposures, some are just starting to wrestle with other scenarios: What if a pregnant employee has a medical emergency while traveling in an anti-abortion state? Or a trans employee faces a confrontation someplace without public accommodation protections for gender identity? Lauren Winans, CEO of Next Level Benefits, an HR consultancy firm, said some of her corporate clients have started maintaining lists of potentially problematic destinations for workers to visit. Others are adopting no-retaliation policies \u201cthat allow employees to express concerns, establish boundaries or refuse travel\u201d to certain areas, she said. The construction bidding platform PlanHub is \u201cthoroughly assessing potential risks tied to the legal and political landscape in various regions,\u201d said Kimberly Rogan, the company\u2019s chief of staff and head of people operations. \u201cWe\u2019ve refined our guidelines to inform employees about these factors better and to provide clear instructions on how to navigate them.\u201d These efforts coincide with a broader post-pandemic focus on mental and physical health and safety, said Daniel Beauchamp, head of global business consulting for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at American Express Global Business Travel. As those concerns become the \u201cfront and center of corporate consciousness,\u201d some U.S. and international employers are taking \u201ca more nuanced\u201d approach to their duty of care, he said. But HR professionals say few of the businesses taking these steps are broadcasting them publicly, and the shift is far from universal. Many companies don\u2019t operate extensively across state borders or rely much on business travel. And it\u2019s often impossible to untangle an employer\u2019s duty of care concerns from its political values \u2014 which can cut both ways anyhow. Some conservative groups and companies have long asked meeting planners to book gatherings in like-minded states, and vice versa for liberal ones. Certain areas say they\u2019re seeing pullback due to the new laws even as business travel rebounds. Between May \u2014 the month Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded what critics termed a \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law \u2014 and mid-September, more than 17 groups cited \u201ccurrent Florida politics\u201d and safety as reasons for not booking conventions in Greater Fort Lauderdale and Broward County, despite a local reputation for inclusiveness, according to the Visit Lauderdale tourism group. That list includes the National Sales Network, the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association, the University of Southern Mississippi and others, said Visit Lauderdale CEO Stacy Ritter. She estimated the community has lost out on more than $98 million in revenue. \u201cThis is not an economic issue where you can offer a group more money to help underwrite their conference,\u201d said Ritter. If people feel unwelcome in the state, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s very little you can do.\u201d A spokesperson for DeSantis dismissed concerns about lost business travel as \u201cnonsense,\u201d saying \u201cFlorida\u2019s economy is booming,\u201d with the state hosting a quarterly record of nearly 38 million visitors at the start of this year.

        "title": "Saving money to buy a house? Your dollar goes half as far as it did at the end of 2020",
        "content": "A tough market for homebuyers keeps getting tougher as the combination of rising prices and climbing mortgage rates makes it even harder to afford a home, new data shows. In spite of these challenges, people are still buying homes. About 4 million are on track to sell this year. But to a shocking extent, rising mortgage rates and the shortage of homes for sale \u2014 which feeds rising prices and bidding wars \u2014 has weakened their financial position. People today are borrowing significantly more money for homes at much higher interest rates than just a few years ago. Overall, a homebuyer\u2019s dollar goes about half as far as it did at the end of 2020. In December 2020, mortgage rates hit some of their lowest levels ever, with a 30-year fixed available for 2.68%. That was a steep drop from 3.78% a year earlier. Today, government-backed lender Fannie Mae says the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.63%. Prices have shot up as well. The median sale price of a single-family home is above $416,000 as of the second quarter of this year, up from just under $360,000 in late 2020. By some measures, U.S. home price indexes are at all-time highs. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said that in late 2020, the monthly mortgage payment on a typical, newly sold home was around $1,100 in principal and interest. It\u2019s now about twice that. The NAR calculates that a buyer today needs to make $107,232 a year to afford that median home. That calculation is based on recent rates for a buyer who makes a 20% down payment and spends 25% of their gross monthly income on housing expenses. That's somewhat conservative, as many people devote more than 25% of their budget to those costs. And home prices vary widely across the U.S. But it still shows how much harder it's getting to afford a house and feel financially secure. Real median household income was $74,580 in 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make six figures, it's going to be really tough\u201d to afford a home in many markets, Yun told NBC News. Another way to measure the change: The NAR also puts out a monthly housing affordability index. A typical reading, Yun said, is 120 \u2014 meaning that a person making a median income has enough money to buy a home that's about 20% above the median price. That figure has fallen from almost 170 pre-Covid to a preliminary total of 91.7 in August. That's the lowest reading since October 1985. According to Yun, part of the problem stems from the housing bust of 2006-08, which kicked off the Great Recession and the global financial crisis. A lot of smaller homebuilders failed, the surviving builders got more conservative, and combined with rising regulatory costs, that has depressed building for a full decade. That's one reason there are fewer homes for sale than usual. Another is that, in many cases, people who already own their homes and are paying mortgage rates in the 3% to 4% range don't want to sell and buy a new home at nearly 8%. The difference between a monthly mortgage payment at 3% and one at 8% can be staggering. For a median-priced home that costs $416,000 with a 20% down payment, your monthly mortgage with 3% interest is $1,403. At 8% interest it's $2,441. Many people are priced out of the housing market, which has also made it more expensive to rent. But there is at least some good news there, according to Yun. \"Thankfully, on the rental side at least, they are building apartments in many cities,\" Yun said. He added that there are some positive signs for homebuilders as well. Stock prices for companies like Toll Brothers and NVR \u2014 the parent company of Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes \u2014 have skyrocketed in the last year, meaning that investors want to give these companies cash that they can use to build more houses. That won't solve the affordability problem on its own, but it would likely help. CORRECTION (Oct. 22, 2023, 9:47 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the rate at which homes are expected to sell in the U.S. Four million homes are expected to sell this year, not every month.

        "title": "Federal agents found more than two dozen minors working in Ohio poultry plant",
        "content": "Federal agents found more than two dozen minors illegally working inside a poultry plant in Kidron, Ohio, earlier this month, according to local immigration advocates who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. The children, mainly from Guatemala, according to the advocates, were working in meat processing and sanitation in a plant run by Gerber\u2019s Poultry, which produces Amish Farm Chicken, advertised with the slogan \u201cBetter feed, better taste.\u201d Marisa Darden, a lawyer representing Gerber's Poultry, had no comment when asked about minors working at the plant on Friday. She told NBC News, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any comment at this time. We are cooperating, we just can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d On Monday, the company said in a statement, \"[W]e were surprised to learn that our Kidron, Ohio plant is the subject of inquiry from federal law enforcement regarding the composition of our employees and some third-party contract employees. We are fully cooperating with that investigation. While we have confidence in our process to ensure we comply with all federal regulations to verify eligibility for employment, we are actively reviewing our policies to ensure compliance at every level and will continue to review our relationships with third party vendors and their policies in similar fashion.\" Local immigration advocates say agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI surrounded the plant in the early evening of Oct. 4 and shut down traffic into and out of the plant.  NBC News spoke to a current employee \u2014 who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media \u2014 who was at the plant the night of the raid and spoke with the FBI agents who were there. The worker said agents arrived around 9:00 p.m. and asked employees for identification, asked about plant sanitation and stayed in the plant most of the night. The agents began organizing large groups of workers into lines, according to apparent video of the operation posted on TikTok. From the videos, it appears many of the workers feared they were being rounded up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of a raid. The agents took photos of the workers and asked them where they got their documents to show they were of age and legally allowed to work in the United States, according to the immigration advocates. They also asked them to fill out a questionnaire that was made available in Spanish, English and in languages indigenous to Guatemala. Local resident Dany Ceto, who has relatives who work at the plant, told NBC News he saw the FBI agents surround the plant and at first assumed it was an immigration raid. He said children work at the plant\u2019s second shift because it works with their school schedule. No arrests were made at the time of the operation, according to multiple eyewitnesses.  It was not immediately clear what company handles sanitation of the plant. Sanitation at meat and poultry plants is often handled by outside firms. In its statement on Monday, Gerber\u2019s Poultry said, \u201c[W]e take the legal employment and safety of all individuals who work for and with our company very seriously. We have formal identity verification procedures in place and dedicate significant resources to ensure that Gerber\u2019s Poultry employees and contractors are legally authorized to work. We also have strict policies against hiring minors in accordance with industry guidelines, rules and laws.\u201d The FBI did not respond to a request for comment and HSI declined to comment. Under U.S. labor law, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to work in meatpacking facilities because of the increased risk of injury from dangerous machines and chemicals. A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy was recently killed working in a poultry plant in Mississippi.  NBC News has previously reported on the 69% rise in child labor in the United States since 2018, particularly among Guatemalan youth who have recently migrated and find themselves working in the meatpacking and sanitation of meatpacking plants.  The immigration advocates working with the Guatemalan community around Kidron, which is near Canton, say they believe some of the children have been forced to work by nonrelated adults who have housed them and are taking some or all of their wages. Others have voluntarily gone to work in meat processing and slaughterhouse sanitation because they want to earn money for themselves, the advocates said.

        "title": "Prosecutors in Sam Bankman-Fried trial compare defense argument to 'Dumb and Dumber'",
        "content": "Prosecutors in the criminal trial against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried compared one of the defense\u2019s arguments to a scene in the 1994 film \u201cDumb and Dumber,\u201d in which actor Jim Carrey says IOUs are \u201cas good as money.\u201d In a written brief on Thursday to Judge Lewis Kaplan, who\u2019s presiding over the Manhattan trial, assistant U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York took issue with several of the jury instructions provided by the defense team. One specific directive reminded prosecutors of the 29-year-old comedy about two less-than-intelligent friends, played by Carrey and Jeff Daniels, who take a cross-country trip to Colorado to return a briefcase full of money to its owner, though the cash had actually been left as ransom. \u201cIf you find that FTX customers, after depositing funds with FTX, received a credit to transact on the FTX exchange and therefore received the right to withdraw an equivalent amount of funds at a later time upon request, that is insufficient to establish that they were deprived of property,\u201d the jury instruction from the defense says. Much of the government\u2019s case hinges on billions of dollars that FTX, Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto exchange, siphoned out of customer accounts and used largely to try and cover up losses at sister hedge fund Alameda Research after cryptocurrency prices plunged. Funds also allegedly went to pay for things such as a $35 million property in the Bahamas and political donations. Customers were ultimately unable to retrieve much of their money as FTX and Alameda were simultaneously imploding. The defense, according to prosecutors, is trying to make the claim to the jury that clients still had a credit to the funds they deposited even if the money wasn\u2019t there because it was being used for other things. Prosecutors say the argument is \u201cuntethered to the facts of the case\u201d and that a \u201ccredit to obtain funds at a later date, if such funds are ultimately available, is clearly not the same, or as valuable, as the money or property itself.\u201d In a footnote, the prosecution writes, \u201cA popular movie from the 1990s illustrates the point: a briefcase, once filled with money, is not the same as a briefcase later filled with IOUs.\u201d In \u201cDumb and Dumber,\u201d when the briefcase reaches its owner, it\u2019s filled with paper. \u201cThat\u2019s as good as money, sir,\u201d says Carrey, playing the character Lloyd Christmas. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lead defense attorney, didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment. Bankman-Fried, 31, faces seven criminal fraud charges tied to the collapse of his crypto empire late last year. Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty, could face life in prison if convicted. The first three weeks of the trial have been highlighted by testimony from Bankman-Fried\u2019s former close friends, who were also top executives at FTX and Alameda and have since turned on him, some through plea deals with the government. The trial is scheduled to resume late next week and extend into November. On numerous occasions, Judge Kaplan has called sidebar meetings with the lead government attorneys and Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers, to discuss their demeanor in the courtroom. Most recently, on Thursday, Kaplan ripped into lawyers from both sides, in particular telling the prosecution that their latest expert witnesses knew nothing specific about important details and yet called Bankman-Fried\u2019s behavior criminal. Both sides were warned to do better and to communicate more with each other. ",

        "title": "America's only Formula One driver is fighting to secure his seat after difficult rookie season",
        "content": "AUSTIN \u2014 Logan Sargeant is the only American driver in Formula One. He\u2019s also the only one of the 20 drivers who hasn\u2019t inked a contract extension beyond the current season. As a rookie season of highs and lows enters its final stretch, the 22-year-old Williams Racing driver said he knows \u201cexactly\u201d what he needs to do to secure his seat with the team beyond 2023. And it could begin at his home race \u2014 a packed weekend with a \u201csprint\u201d race on Saturday and the United States Grand Prix on Sunday. \u201cI know what it takes. And I just need to give them a reason to be happy,\u201d Sargeant told NBC News in an interview Thursday at the team\u2019s suite in the paddock. \u201cI don\u2019t need to do anything special. Just be clean, consistent and keep the pace up.\u201d Asked recently if he\u2019s considering replacing Sargeant, Williams team boss James Vowles said he \u201chas very clear targets of what he has to hit before the end of the season, and we are working with him continuously.\u201d In a video posted to the team\u2019s website, he said, \u201cWe want him to succeed, and we want him in the car next year.\u201d Sargeant said he knows what those targets are, and laid out his goals for the last five races in the calendar. First, \u201cto continue the pace I\u2019ve had,\u201d which he feels confident of, as \u201cI\u2019ve found a good spot with the car and it\u2019s all moved in the right direction.\u201d Second, he said, he wants to cut out what he called \u201csplit-second silly errors.\u201d Among those errors are two costly incidents last month \u2014 in Singapore, when he hit the barrier and damaged his front wing at a street race, and in Japan, when he overcooked the throttle on the last corner of a hot qualifying lap and slid into the barrier. \u201cObviously, you learn from those but I feel like I\u2019ve made, you know, a couple of too many. But yeah, live and learn,\u201d Sargeant said. He also cited \u201ca lot of amazing moments,\u201d including July\u2019s British Grand Prix, when he earned his best finish of 11th place \u2014 just five seconds away from becoming the first American to score points in Formula One since Michael Andretti in 1993. It\u2019s a goal that has eluded him in a slower \u2014 yet improving \u2014 Williams car that is outmatched by most of the grid. Sargeant downplayed points this weekend, saying it\u2019s \u201cbecoming more and more difficult by the round.\u201d As other teams bring upgrades, Williams has instead switched focus to building next year\u2019s car. But he said it is possible to bring in points, noting that his more experienced teammate, Alex Albon, has seized opportunities when they arise and secured multiple points finishes. \u201cIf we just keep ourselves in a good position, keep it clean, doors will open and we just need to be ready to walk through that door when it comes,\u201d Sargeant said. \u201cSo there\u2019s always opportunity, and obviously, I\u2019m really motivated to do well here.\u201d As the sport\u2019s only American, Sargeant is the only driver with three home races. Along with Austin, Formula One added a race in Miami, and next month it\u2019ll hold its first Las Vegas Grand Prix with a long straight down the glamorous \u201cStrip.\u201d It\u2019s a huge bet on the future of the sport in this rapidly growing market. Nothing would cement it quite like an American driver competing for points, podiums and even race wins. And losing the sport\u2019s only U.S. driver could be a step backward.  Austin has a special significance for Sargeant. Last year, he made his Formula One debut at an official practice session here. Two years ago, he was announced as a Williams Racing Academy Driver here. \u201cAnd now, to be doing the full circle back here to do a race with the team is just awesome. So it\u2019s always good experiences when I come here, and hopefully, we can build on that through the weekend,\u201d Sargeant said. He refrained from laying out a target finish when asked how he defines success for him this weekend: \u201cThe result doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s just about getting the most out of the car that I have. And if I know I\u2019ve done that, then I\u2019m a happy man.\u201d Earlier this season, Sargeant drew attention for a quirk of his: Not drinking water during a race. Formula One drivers lose multiple pounds during a single race, and drivers regularly drink water from the cockpit to stave off dehydration. Sargeant said he recently started drinking water, but that it's not the most enjoyable thing. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a little bit in the car since Singapore. But I mean the water is boiling hot after five to 10 laps, it almost becomes irrelevant,\u201d he quipped. \u201cYou just try and get a little bit down, but at the same time, when you\u2019re driving it\u2019s boiling-hot water \u2014 you\u2019re trying not to cough drinking it. It\u2019s a bit of a pain.\u201d Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Bipartisan Senate bill would increase penalties for child labor violations and create new criminal penalties",
        "content": "A bipartisan bill introduced late Wednesday would increase penalties for child labor violations, create new criminal penalties and allow victims who are harmed by child labor violations to file civil lawsuits.  The new legislative effort from Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., comes amid a 69% increase in child labor violations, according to figures from the Labor Department. \u201cRecent data shows that child labor exploitation is not a thing of the past or a problem limited to the developing world. This bipartisan bill would strengthen our nation\u2019s labor laws to better protect our children,\u201d Young said. \u201cSome industry representatives would prefer these fines stay low forever,\u201d Schatz said. He said he was motivated to act when he learned the fines were \u201cminiscule.\u201d \u201cYou know, a 16-year-old is killed in a sawmill and multiple other kids are injured and the penalty is so small as to constitute the cost of doing business,\u201d he said. The bill, if passed, would introduce a new criminal penalty for those who repeatedly hire children that would include a fine of up to $50,000 and a year in jail. Earlier this year NBC News reported that a company that hired children to clean Midwestern slaughterhouses hired the same known minor two times in a six-month period. The new bill would also increase child labor fines from a $15,000 maximum to a new $132,270 maximum. For serious injury or death, a company could be fined up to $601,150 for each violation. The current maximum fine is $25,000. The bill would also let children who have been harmed seek compensation. The Labor Department has uncovered child labor violations at a wide range of businesses, from fast-food restaurants to slaughterhouses to factories and construction. Under federal law, children under 18 are not allowed to work in most manufacturing facilities because of the dangers in the workplace.  Employers who hire children often say they find it difficult to determine if a worker is of age because they use fake identification that says the worker is over 18. \u201cI think it\u2019s not as hard as they say,\u201d Schatz said, adding that his office has been in conversation with industry on the new child labor legislation. \u201cThe good actors want to make sure that not only are they complying, but that the law is crafted in such a way that they are not accidentally violating it.\u201d Fatalities in the past year and a half have exposed the dangers that children who are hired illegally can face on the job. A 16-year-old died in July from injuries received at a Wisconsin sawmill. Labor Department investigators found the company, Florence Hardwoods, illegally employed nine children, ages 14 to 17, who operated such machinery as a chop saw and a rip saw. Another 16-year-old died cleaning a chicken processing plant in Mississippi in July. A 17-year-old named John Gomez Garcia died in Colorado in 2022 when a trench he was digging collapsed on top of him. The autopsy showed that Garcia died when his head was crushed. The incident report from the fire department noted that when firefighters arrived on the scene, they found \u201cfrantic bystanders attempting to dig victim out.\u201d Laura Strickler is a senior investigative producer and reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Billionaires are driving South Florida home prices to new records",
        "content": "From Palm Beach to Miami Beach, luxury home prices in Florida\u2019s richest enclaves are reaching new records as billionaires and millionaires continue to buy up property. The average sale price of a home in Palm Beach topped $20 million in the third quarter, making it far and away the most expensive market in the country, according to data from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. The average price per square foot of homes sold in Palm Beach reached $4,554, \u2014 more than 2.5 times more expensive than Manhattan. \u201cThe prices are mind-blowing,\u201d said Chris Leavitt, a top Palm Beach broker with Douglas Elliman. \u201cThere is a very limited supply, especially at the ultra-high-net-worth end, where the clientele is all clambering for that amazing lakefront or oceanfront property.\u201d South Florida\u2019s mansion boom is being driven by the continued flight of millionaires and billionaires from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California, as well as the growth of the Florida economy. Since ultra-wealthy buyers usually pay cash for their real estate, they\u2019re less affected by soaring mortgage rates. The lack of inventory, especially for coveted waterfront locations, has powered a new surge in prices. Palm Beach only has 53 homes on the market as of the third quarter \u2014 down 61% from the pre-pandemic levels, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel. The shortage of listed homes has reduced the number of sales, which were down 31% over the past year, he said. Yet brokers say the low inventory will continue to put upward pressure on prices, making trophy properties expensive even for multi-millionaires. \u201cYou can still find a nice house here for under $10 million,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cI know that sounds like an alternative universe. Because yes, this is an alternative universe.\u201d In late July, a waterfront home that had last sold for $7.4 million went for about $50 million. The seller was the estate of the late liquor distributor James Tigani, Jr., and the buyer was reported to be venture investor Harvey Jones. Fashion tycoon Tommy Hilfiger this summer sold a Palm Beach mansion for $41.4 million, less than six months after he bought it for $36.9 million. The record for the most expensive home sold in Palm Beach was set in April when luxury car dealer Michael Cantanucci paid $170 million for a 1.6-acre oceanfront mansion. Leavitt said that while the summer was slow, buyers came rushing back starting in mid-September. \u201cUsually September isn\u2019t that busy, but the market is heating up earlier this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThese buyers move very fast. They will call and say, \u2018I\u2019m flying down tomorrow.\u2019 They\u2019ll fly down on their private jet, they will look, buy it and close within seven days. And they\u2019re back in a month to move in. They want what they want, when they want it.\u201d Miami Beach has also seen a spike in prices from wealthy buyers \u2014 especially billionaires. While the number of sales of single-family homes in the Miami Beach area fell 3% in the third quarter, the dollar value of sales jumped 62% due to more closings over $10 million, according to Corcoran. The average price of luxury real estate in Miami Beach \u2014 defined as the top 10% of the market \u2014 surged to a record $25 million, according to Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. \u201cThe luxury and high-end housing markets seem untethered to mortgage rates and the economy right now,\u201d Jonathan Miller said. \u201cBoth Palm Beach and Miami Beach are disconnected from the interest rate trend.\u201d Tech billionaire Eric Schmidt and his wife are the latest billionaires to start amassing real estate collections in Miami. Brokers say the couple has purchased over a half-dozen homes on the Sunset Islands, spending over $140 million in all. It\u2019s unclear if the Schmidts plan to live in Miami or what they plan to do with the properties. Hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin continues to expand his footprint on Star Island, recently buying back a piece of property for $45.5 million. He had sold the property to retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez in 2020 as part of a land swap. Griffin also paid $107 million last year for a historic waterfront estate in Miami. Jeff Bezos has also joined the billionaires beach club, spending $150 million for two adjoining properties in Indian Creek Village. The two properties give him a combined 4.6 acres in an exclusive enclave and make him a neighbor to NFL legend Tom Brady. ",

        "title": "Delta makes more tweaks to frequent flyer program after backlash",
        "content": "Delta Air Lines is trying to appease flyers who were angry about changes to its loyalty programs. But the company isn't undoing the changes it announced last month. Starting next year, rewards will depend on how much money flyers spend on Delta flights instead of how many flights they take or the number of miles they fly. That means customers will have to spend much more money to earn the rewards that come with Medallion status. However, Delta made it easier to reach those levels than it would have been under the first version of the plan. Whereas Delta had originally proposed requiring people to spend 6,000 \"qualifying dollars\" to reach the lowest status, Silver, it will now take 5,000. The current rules have flyers reaching Silver status if they take 30 flights or reach a combination of 3,000 qualifying dollars and points. Delta says that because it has reduced the mileage thresholds, spending on car rentals and hotels will no longer count toward the spending totals. And spending on basic economy trips will still not count toward Medallion status. Delta also says it will limit the number of times American Express Platinum Card and Delta Reserve American Express Card users can visit airport lounges, although it eased those limits compared to last month, as well. The previous changes angered some Delta customers and prompted other brands to announce offers to win away their business. American Airlines also announced changes to its frequent flyer program this year. More people have achieved frequent flyer statues in recent years as consumers have spent more money on air travel and through co-branded credit cards. That has been costly for airlines, and they've started making it harder to earn frequent flyer rewards in response. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Jerome Powell says inflation is still too high and lower economic growth is likely needed to bring it down",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged recent signs of cooling inflation, but said Thursday that the slowing in price increases was not enough yet to determine a trend and that the central bank would be \u201cresolute\u201d in its commitment to its 2% mandate. \u201cInflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,\u201d Powell said in prepared remarks for his speech at the Economic Club of New York. \u201cWe cannot yet know how long these lower readings will persist, or where inflation will settle over coming quarters.\u201d \u201cWhile the path is likely to be bumpy and take some time, my colleagues and I are united in our commitment to bringing inflation down sustainably to 2 percent,\u201d Powell added. However, he also noted that progress made toward the Fed\u2019s twin goals. In recent days, data has shown that while inflation remains well above the target rate, the pace of monthly increases has decelerated and the annual rate has slowed to 3.7% from more than 9% in June 2022. \u201cIncoming data over recent months show ongoing progress toward both of our dual mandate goals \u2014maximum employment and stable prices,\u201d he said. The speech was delayed at the onset by protesters from the group Climate Defiance who charged the dais at the club\u2019s dinner and held up a sign saying \u201cFed is burning\u201d surrounded by the words \u201cmoney, futures and planet.\u201d Powell hinted the labor market and economic growth may need to slow to ultimately achieve the Fed\u2019s goal. \u201cStill, the record suggests that a sustainable return to our 2 percent inflation goal is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some further softening in labor market conditions,\u201d Powell said. The comments come the same day initial jobless claims hit their lowest weekly level since early in 2023, indicating that the labor market is still tight and could exert upward pressure on inflation. Fed officials have been using interest rate hikes in part to try to level out a supply-demand imbalance in the jobs market. However, robust job creation in September and a slow pace of layoffs could put progress on inflation at risk. \u201cAdditional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,\u201d he said. In recent days, other Fed officials have said they think the Fed can be patient from here. Even some members who favor tighter monetary policy have said they think the Fed can halt rate hikes at least for now while they watch the lagged impact the rate hikes are expected to have on the economy. Markets widely expect the Fed to hold off on additional rate hikes, though there remain questions over when officials might begin cutting rates. Powell was noncommittal on the future of policy. Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\u201d he said.

        "title": "New York sues crypto firms for alleged $1 billion fraud, cites SBF hedge fund bet",
        "content": "Crypto firms Digital Currency Group and Gemini defrauded more than 230,000 investors out of a collective $1.1 billion, New York state prosecutors said in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Thursday. They cited a series of missteps, including failure to adequately manage the risk associated with exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s bankrupt and allegedly fraudulent crypto trading firm. To perpetrate the alleged fraud, Digital Currency Group and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Genesis Global Capital and Genesis, lied to investors, created false financial documents and withheld information from creditors, prosecutors alleged. Genesis was once the flagship of crypto mogul Barry Silbert\u2019s empire. An over-the-counter trading desk, prime brokerage and lender, it collected crypto from its customers and lent it out to other parties, reaping profits from the interest it charged its clients. For a time, it was very lucrative, until crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on its loans and sent much of the crypto world into tumult. Genesis and DCG have since acknowledged their significant exposure to Three Arrows, or 3AC. But New York prosecutors alleged that Genesis both failed to audit 3AC properly for more than two years, and that when 3AC collapsed, Genesis and its parent company DCG conspired to conceal details of the crisis from investors and the public. Those investors included Gemini, which was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and its customers. Gemini operated a high-yield program called Gemini Earn, which allowed retail customers to hand over their crypto to Gemini in what was described as a \u201clow-risk\u201d model, prosecutors said. Gemini would then give Genesis that customer crypto for further lending, collecting a slice of Genesis\u2019 interest. The program launched in February 2021, while interest rates were still depressed and many investors were hunting for yield. One of Genesis\u2019s biggest counterparties was Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading firm Alameda Research. By extension, prosecutors say, that meant that Gemini also had exposure to Alameda \u2014 and allegedly knew they did. New York prosecutors in the same suit accused Gemini of failing to address the \u201crisky\u201d exposure it had to Bankman-Fried\u2019s Alameda Research, through its relationship with Genesis. Gemini conducted risk analyses on Genesis\u2019 loan book that allegedly showed a major exposure to Alameda, as high as 60% at one unspecified point, and revised Genesis\u2019 internal creditworthiness to junk status, according to prosecutors. But in spite of those internal analyses, prosecutors say that Gemini didn\u2019t end its significant exposure to Genesis and Bankman-Fried, despite one Gemini board member comparing \u201cGenesis\u2019 financial condition to that of Lehman Brothers before its collapse.\u201d New York prosecutors are seeking to permanently bar Gemini, Genesis, DCG, Silbert and various executives from securities and commodities work within New York, as well as restitution and disgorgement. \u201cHardworking New Yorkers and investors around the country lost more than a billion dollars because they were fed blatant lies that their money would be safe and grow if they invested it in Gemini Earn,\u201d New York attorney general Letitia James said in a statement. \u201cInstead, Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis and Genesis lied to the public about its losses.\u201d It isn\u2019t the first time that James has targeted crypto firms. Earlier this year, her office sued Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange Celsius, alleging he defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors. Mashinsky was charged by federal prosecutors with fraud in July and faces prison if convicted. DCG did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment. \u201cWe wholly disagree with the NY AG\u2019s decision to also sue Gemini,\u201d Gemini said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cBlaming a victim for being defrauded and lied to makes no sense and we look forward to defending ourselves against this inconsistent position.\u201d The suit \u201cconfirms what we\u2019ve been saying all along \u2014 that Gemini, Earn users, and other creditors were the victims of a massive fraud,\u201d the company added.

        "title": "Who's most affected by rental evictions? Kids, for starters",
        "content": "Those most at risk of facing eviction proceedings and having to move out of their rental homes are infants and young children, according to a new analysis by The Eviction Lab and the U.S. Census Bureau that, for the first time, tallies the number of people threatened. \u201cWhat we realized is that children are the population most impacted by evictions. If you have children in your home, the odds of you being a victim of eviction are much higher,\" said Juan Pablo Garnham, head of communications and policy at The Eviction Lab, in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \"We found that 2.9 million children under the age of 18 are threatened by eviction processes every year, which is a huge number,\u201d he said. Of those children who are threatened by eviction, about 1.5 million, or 2 in 5 who face this threat receive an eviction judgment.  The recent study offers the most complete demographic picture of those living in rental housing and facing eviction proceedings, after researchers linked hundreds of thousands of eviction requests with detailed records from the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cWe were able to access official census data and the results are chilling numbers: We now know that, on average, 7.6 million people are threatened with eviction each year,\" Garnham said. \"This is data taken from 2007 to 2016 but, with the exception of when the pandemic eviction moratorium was implemented, the numbers remain fairly constant.\" According to the report, \u201cadult renters living with at least one child in their home were threatened with eviction at an annual rate of 10.4%, compared to 5.0% for those without children.\" The gap was \"particularly pronounced for Black women,\" the data found, where filing rates were 28% with children present and 16% for those without children. \u201cDespite the fact that fewer than 1 in 5 renters in the United States are Black, about half of all evictions are against Black people, and that obviously includes Afro Latinos,\u201d Garnham said. Black\u2013white disparities persisted across levels of income, though it varied by state.   Although eviction rates among Hispanics tend to be below 5%, which is sometimes even lower than non-Latino whites, Garnham warned that this number is far from accurate. \u201cBecause this data comes from the courts, from the formal eviction processes,\" he said, \"it doesn\u2019t contemplate the informal evictions that are often applied to the undocumented Hispanic population \u2014 and we believe that this figure must be enormous.\" It's estimated there are around 11 million undocumented people in the country. \u201cIn our study, because of the way we are linking people to census records, we can only focus on people who have a Social Security number,\" Nick Graetz, one of the study's authors, said. \"So we don\u2019t take into account undocumented immigrants, for example, as well as other people who have less contact with the different government systems. It\u2019s very difficult to see what those communities are going through.\" According to Eviction Lab researchers, many Hispanics, especially those with family members who lack legal status, don't go through formal judicial or legal processes when they get an eviction notice, so they end up being evicted informally without any legal or judicial record. \u201cWe were only given a month to get out of the apartment. We had lived there for about a year-and-a-half, but from one day to the next the owner said that the city had asked him to make arrangements and that it was urgent,\u201d said Maria, who lives in Irvine, California, and whose last name is being withheld as she is still processing her legal work permit. \u201cI have a 5-month-old baby girl, but I still don\u2019t have papers so I had to go into debt so I could get another house and get out on time. Now I owe $6,500,\u201d says Maria, 26, originally from Puebla, Mexico.  \u201cAn eviction is not only a judicial process and a piece of paper, but it is something that has an impact on your life on many levels: health, economic, school performance and mental health. There are many people who tell us that a child doesn\u2019t forget this and that it impacts them for a long time,\u201d Garnham said. In recent years, researchers have shown that adverse childhood experiences can have lifelong consequences for health, education and employment. Housing instability before age 5 can lead to delays in kindergarten readiness and is associated with attention and behavioral problems and delays in cognitive abilities in school. Teens are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety and to have difficulty processing information. \u201cSince a month ago, my life became hell because the owner of the apartment sent us a letter asking us to vacate,\u201d explains Patricia Montes, 36, who works as a teacher\u2019s aide for children with special needs. Montes lives with her mother, Josefina Sandoval, who is 68 and works cleaning houses in Costa Mesa, California. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in this apartment for 35 years and all of a sudden we see that all over the neighborhood they\u2019re buying up properties, evicting tenants and then just painting and raising rents so much, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Sandoval said despondently. Montes said that since she is a citizen and her mother has a work permit, they have not been afraid to ask for legal help and advice to get the time they need to get a new place or reach an agreement with the landlord. \u201cWe know this is an injustice, in reality, what worries me most are my children. I am a single mother of a 17-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy and all this affects them a lot. It makes them anxious, and they don\u2019t want to leave their friends at school or in the neighborhood. This is very sad,\u201d Montes said. Housing instability can affect children\u2019s well-being by causing them to experience other stressors, such as food insecurity and issues with health care coverage. According to The Eviction Lab, in the 10 states and 34 cities for which the research has real-time data, landlords have filed more than 86,000 eviction petitions in the past month, and that number rose just over 1 million in the past 12 months. While high housing prices mean that homeownership is no longer a possibility for many Americans, experts say rising rents are making it harder for renters to pay, which is leading to more eviction filings by landlords. \u201cIn my neighborhood there are companies that are buying apartment buildings and using the pretext that they are going to make repairs to the housing and that\u2019s why people have to leave. But when you ask at city hall, those companies didn\u2019t apply for any permits to fix anything, and what they do is paint the units and then rent them out much more expensively,\u201d said Mario Fonseca, 30, an IT specialist in Costa Mesa California. According to a September report from Zillow, the average rent in the U.S. is now $2,050, up 3.3% from last year. Costa Mesa community leader Juana Casas said some renters are duped by landlords. \u201cOne health promoter was evicted after she had been living in the same apartment for 25 years. She was told that the city had declared the apartments uninhabitable, but that was a lie,\u201d she said. According to Casas, many move out without claiming their rights as tenants. The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) points out in a recent report that a full-time worker would need to earn $28.58 per hour to rent a two-bedroom apartment, which is well above the national minimum wage of $7.25. More low-income workers are paying high rents as they struggle with wages that are not keeping pace with inflation and amid the end of pandemic programs that helped them stay afloat. The U.S. also faces a shortfall of 7.3 million affordable rental housing units for extremely low-income renters (incomes at or below the federal poverty line or 30% of area median income), NLIHC reports. \"I learned a long time ago that no one is going to come to help us if we don\u2019t claim our rights,\" Casas said. \"That\u2019s why we have to fight.\" An earlier version of this story was first published on Noticias Telemundo.

        "content": "United Airlines will change its boarding order next week by letting economy-class passengers who have selected window seats to board before those with middle and aisle seats. The company said the change could shave two minutes off the boarding process. The new procedure will begin Oct. 26, according to a company memo shared with CNBC. United said boarding times have increased up to two minutes since 2019.

        "title": "Rite Aid is closing more than 150 stores as part of its bankruptcy process",
        "content": "Rite Aid has announced it will close at least 154 stores as part of its bankruptcy process. The chain had 2,253 stores as of Sept. 3, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey also approved additional closings at a later date. The company has not disclosed how many more stores it may shut down. Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after struggling for years with debt and sluggish sales. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Rite Aid was negotiating with its creditors over a plan to close 400 to 500 stores. The states hardest hit by the closures include Pennsylvania, California and New York. Rite Aid is currently the third-largest U.S. drugstore chain behind CVS and Walgreens, which have around 9,000 locations each. But all three are closing stores as they deal with greater competition from pharmacies in big box stores and grocery chains, as well as newer retailers in the beauty industry and online pharmacies. The loss of pharmacies is a serious problem, especially for people in poorer urban and rural areas, according to Nick Fabrizio, senior lecturer in health policy at Cornell University and also a consultant for hospitals and medical groups. \"If that's your one Rite Aid that's closing, the thought of having to go 20 minutes to find another Walmart or another pharmacy is daunting,\" he said, referring to people in smaller towns. Fabrizio added that the closures aren't just inconvenient for people who have to drive farther to fill a prescription. It means people will have a harder time getting everything from bandages to over-the-counter medications. And over the last few years, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, pharmacies have started to replace physicians' offices as a destination for all sorts of vaccinations. \"Pharmacies since Covid are doing so much more, including immunizations, and if we take them out of the picture that\u2019s significant,\" Fabrizio said. \"Right now there is no one to backfill in these pharmacy deserts.\" \"The greatest risk are those communities both in rural America and inner cities where there might be fewer choices,\" he said.

        "title": "'He is the killer': Joran van der Sloot admitted to bludgeoning Natalee Holloway",
        "content": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Joran van der Sloot bludgeoned Natalee Holloway to death on an Aruban beach and pushed her body into the water, in a stunning admission that solved this nearly two-decade mystery, court records showed Wednesday. Holloway\u2019s 2005 disappearance had long been linked to van der Sloot, who appeared in federal court to plead guilty to extortion and wire fraud in connection with the Alabama teen's case. Van der Sloot had previously pleaded not guilty to all charges before Wednesday's legal about-face. \u201cI have considered the factual statements about extortion and wire fraud but also considered your confession to the brutal murder of Natalee Holloway,\u201d U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco said before sentencing him to 20 years in prison. In his plea agreement, van der Sloot said he was on a beach in Aruba when Holloway rebuffed his sexual advances. Holloway kneed him in the crotch before he kicked her \"extremely hard\" in the face, he told prosecutors. She was unconscious when he found a cinderblock nearby and used it to \"smash her head in with it completely,\" van der Sloot admitted. He then took her body to water, got in knee-deep, and pushed the teen's body out into the ocean. \"After that, I, I get out,\" he said. \"I walk home.\" The teen's mother, Beth Holloway, said she's satisfied with that confession. \"A far as I'm concerned it's over, it's over,\" Holloway told reporters outside court. \"Joran van der Sloot is no longer the suspect in my daughter's murder. He is the killer.\" Van der Sloot's confession was backed up by his polygraph test, according to the mother. \"Even with this confession, though, he can't be tried here for Natalee's murder,\" Holloway said. \"But I am satisfied knowing that he did it, he did it alone and he disposed of her alone.\" Van der Sloot's term is to run concurrently with his time in Peru, where he's serving time for the murder 21-year-old college student Stephany Flores. If van der Sloot's 28-year prison sentence in Peru ends early, he'd be returned to the U.S. to complete the extortion and wire fraud convictions here, the judge said. \u201cI have what I need,\" Holloway said. \"Her case is solved.\u201d After Manasco declared his guilt, van der Sloot told the court he's embraced Christianity and said he's a different person than he was nearly two decades ago. \u201cI would like to apologize to the Holloway family,\" said van der Sloot, wearing an orange jail jumpsuit over a white T-shirt. \"I am no longer that person back then than I am today. I gave my heart to Jesus Christ, he helped me through all of this.\" The apology didn't move Beth Holloway. \"You are a killer and I want you to remember that every time that jail cell door slams,\" Holloway said from the courtroom lectern. Holloway rhetorically asked van der Sloot how he\u2019d feel if the victim were his daughter, bludgeoned to death by a killer who then had simply gone \u201chome and gotten off on a porn site.\u201d Court documents describing van der Sloot\u2019s actions that night did not include what he did after the crime. In an interview later Wednesday, Holloway said she was allowed to witness the prosecution's interview with van der Sloot, in which he admitted to watching pornography and checking soccer scores shortly after having killed Natalee Holloway. \"OK, how could he have murdered her and then he goes home and checks the soccer scores, gets on a porn site and gets up and takes a shower and goes to school?\" she asked. Toward the end of her courtroom remarks, Beth Holloway turned to face van der Sloot, who appears to have gained weight since he arrived in the U.S. in June, and addressed him directly. \"You look like hell, Joran,\" she said. \"I don't see how you're going to make it.\" The charges he's admitted to are only indirectly tied to Holloway\u2019s disappearance and slaying. A federal grand jury indicted van der Sloot in 2010 on single counts of wire fraud and extortion. He was extradited to the U.S. in June to face allegations that he demanded $250,000 from Holloway\u2019s family in exchange for information about what happened to the 18-year-old from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was set to attend the University of Alabama on scholarship. Van der Sloot made an initial deal for Beth Holloway to pay $25,000 to learn the body\u2019s location before the remaining $225,000 would be settled once remains were found. Van der Sloot told the mother and her lawyer that Natalee Holloway\u2019s \u201cbody was placed under the foundation of a building near the Aruba Racquet Club\u201d that had been under construction at the time of her disappearance, according to the plea agreement.  But building records and satellite images of that neighborhood showed there was no construction happening at that time, the court document said. Van der Sloot later confirmed that the information he provided was \u201cworthless.\u201d \"Natalee's family suffered a loss no family should ever have to endure,\" said NBC News legal analyst and former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, who initiated this case against Van der Sloot back in 2010. \"Nothing can change that, but I hope these proceedings help them feel like they've received a measure of justice for her murder.\" U.S. Attorney Prim Escalona praised Beth Holloway and her family for pressing the case for all these years since her disappearance. \"I cannot imagine the heartache, the sleepless nights and the tears that Beth and her family must have shed, wondering what happened to Natalee?\" she said. \"Despite their grief, the Holloway family kept fighting for justice for Natalee. Their love for their daughter and sister is what brought us to this day.\" The missing teen had dreams of being a doctor, Beth Holloway said. \"Natalee would be 36 years old. I think of the doctor she would be,\" her mother told the court. \"You terminated her potential, her dream, you terminated that when you bludgeoned her to death.\" Beth Holloway choked back tears and said: \"She would have made all her dreams come true.\u201d Van der Sloot\u2019s lawyers left the courthouse Wednesday without speaking to reporters. His lead attorney did not immediately respond to messages seeking his comment. Natalee Holloway disappeared in Aruba during a vacation with classmates, celebrating their high school graduation. She was last seen on May 30, 2005, at about 1:30 a.m. as she left Carlos 'N Charlie's Nightclub in Oranjestad with three young men, van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe, the FBI has said. A probate judge declared Holloway dead in 2012 and no one was ever tried for her presumed slaying. The statute of limitations for homicide is 12 years in Aruba, so any admission of guilt in Holloway's death could not lead to local prosecution. Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe were not with Holloway and van der Sloot when she was attacked and had no involvement in the slaying, the defendant said in his plea bargain agreement. Before van der Sloot arrived in Alabama this past summer, he had been locked up in Peru for the Flores murder. Flores was killed in his hotel room in Lima on May 30, 2010, after she allegedly looked at his laptop computer and found out he was connected to Holloway\u2019s disappearance. A Peruvian court sentenced him to 28 years behind bars for Flores\u2019 slaying. With time served, that sentence could, in theory, keep him locked up until 2038. But he's eligible for parole after having done half his sentenced time, in addition to other good behavior credits. Beth Holloway said she wants to celebrate her daughter's life through time spent with Natalee's brother and his children. \"I think now it becomes easier for me to appreciate her life through my son's life and through children's lives, and I really hadn't been\" able to do that, she said. \"I've been a little distracted.\" Choking back tears, Beth Holloway added: \"Now I can focus on that.\" Sam Brock and Juliette Arcodia reported from Birmingham and David K. Li from New York City. CORRECTION: (OCT. 18, 2023, 1:09 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled van der Sloot\u2019s first name. He is Joran, not Jordan.

        "title": "Mortgage demand falls to the lowest level since 1995 as interest rates near 8%",
        "content": "Mortgage rates last week rose for the sixth straight week, causing demand for home loans to drop to the lowest level since 1995. Total application volume fell 6.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.70% from 7.67% and points decreased to 0.71 from 0.75 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the highest rate since November 2000. The rate was 6.94% during the same week one year ago. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 6% week to week and were 21% lower than the same week one year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan fell 10% for the week and were 12% lower than a year ago. \u201cBoth purchase and refinance applications declined, driven by larger drops for conventional applications,\u201d said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. He added that the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share was 9.3%, the highest share in 11 months. ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years before the rate resets. More borrowers are turning to these loan products to gain purchasing power, as both interest rates and home prices are rising. Mortgage rates moved even higher to start this week, with the 30-year fixed hitting 7.92% on Tuesday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is a cyclical high. The increase was due to a much stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales report. Diana Olick is an Emmy Award-winning journalist, currently serving as CNBC's real estate correspondent. ",

        "title": "This Midwestern city wants more residents and this is what they're paying",
        "content": "The city of Topeka, Kansas, wants people to move there \u2014 and it has been offering economic incentives to attract new residents and workers, including Latino and immigrant families. Under the incentives program, known as Choose Topeka, people like Erick Bovell can receive up to $15,000 if they rent or buy homes in the city and are employed by local businesses that partner with the program, with a minimum salary requirement of $50,000 a year. Qualifying applicants must have permission to work in the U.S., meaning the incentives are not available for undocumented immigrants. Bovell, a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to Topeka two years ago, said he got a $10,000 incentive after the city received proof that he had bought a home. The program is funded equally by the city and the participating businesses, many of which are recruiting Hispanic workers, said Sean Dixon, the president of Visit Topeka. \"I love the city. It is a quiet city, without traffic,\" Bovell told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. The Choose Topeka program was launched in 2019 to support employers and promote economic development. \u201cWe are a city that depends on immigrant labor, Hispanic or Latino labor,\u201d Topeka\u2019s chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer, Ernesto de la Rosa, told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. The program has helped bring almost 100 individuals and families to Topeka, NBC affiliate KSNT reported in February. It was recently expanded to support veterans, recent graduates of Washburn University and \u201cboomerang\u201d residents seeking to return to the city. The city also has an incentive program for people looking to start and grow their small businesses, offering grants to owners and startups to improve their financial performances and business sustainability or to enter new markets. In some cases, grants can cover up to 50% of the expenses to start a new business, said Israel Sanchez, director of equity and business development for GO Topeka. The population of Shawnee County, where Topeka is located, increased by 2,265 residents from 2021 to 2022, the largest and fastest population growth Topeka has had in a decade. The county\u2019s population has also become younger and more diverse, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The county's nonwhite population grew by almost 7%, led by increases in new Hispanic and biracial residents, and its median age decreased by nearly two years, to about 38. Hispanics are the second-largest ethnic group in Topeka, at about 20,000 Latino residents. Topeka's total population is nearly 127,000, according to the city.

        "title": "Law firm rescinds job offers to Harvard students over Israel letters",
        "content": "Top U.S. law firm Davis Polk announced in an internal email that it had rescinded letters of employment for three law students at Harvard and Columbia universities who it believed were tied to organizational statements about Israel, one of the latest responses to open letters from university groups about the Israel-Hamas conflict that have roiled university donors, employers, alumni and students.  \u201cThese statements are simply contrary to our firm\u2019s values and we thus concluded that rescinding these offers was appropriate in upholding our responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive work environment for all Davis Polk employees,\u201d said the email, signed by Neil Barr.  Small-business lawyer Joseph Gerstel posted a screenshot of the email Tuesday on LinkedIn. A Davis Polk representative confirmed it as authentic.  Barr went on to write, \u201cAt this time, we remain in dialogue with two of these students to ensure that any further color being offered to us by these students is considered.\u201d A representative of Davis Polk pointed to a statement that was included in the email: \u201cThe views expressed in certain of the statements signed by law school student organizations in recent days are in direct contravention of our firm\u2019s value system. For this reason and to ensure we continue to maintain a supportive and inclusive work environment, the student leaders responsible for signing on to these statements are no longer welcome in our firm; and their offers of employment have thus been rescinded.\u201d  The representative did not immediately respond to a question about how the firm identified the students as having signed the statements. The identities of the students were not revealed in the email, which did not specify which statements the students allegedly signed. A series of public statements supporting Palestinians and blaming Israel for the recent Israel-Hamas conflict has created a firestorm on college campuses and in corporate America since last week. On Oct. 10, The Harvard Crimson, one of the university\u2019s student-run news publications, reported that more than 30 Harvard student groups signed on to a letter that said they held Israel \u201centirely responsible\u201d for \u201call unfolding violence\u201d in the conflict, which came after a surprise Hamas attack on Israel killed over 1,300 people. Since the letter was published, numerous CEOs, business leaders and a federal judge have responded by cutting ties with the university, calling for the identifications of students involved with the letter or saying they would not hire the students involved.  Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman posted on X that he would \u201clike to know\u201d which students signed the Harvard statement \u201cso I know never to hire these people.\u201d  \u201cSame,\u201d EasyHealth CEO David Duel wrote on X, replying to Neman.  FabFitFun CEO Michael Broukhim echoed them, and in a post on X he wrote, \u201cDiscriminating against terrorist supporters is the most comically easy decision I\u2019ll ever have to make as a CEO.\u201d Judge Matthew Solomson of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims also reportedly made a statement on LinkedIn that he would not let any of the students who signed on to the statements clerk for him.  Prominent donors have also cut ties with Harvard over the statement, including the Wexner Foundation \u2014 co-founded by Leslie Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria\u2019s Secret.  The Harvard Crimson reported last week that at least four online websites have revealed the identities and personal information of students in groups that signed the statement. The Harvard student group that issued the statement has removed the list of organizations that signed on to it. Harvard President Claudine Gay pushed back against the students\u2019 statement, writing in her own statement to the Crimson on Oct. 10 that \u201cno student group \u2014 not even 30 student groups \u2014 speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.\u201d Student groups at other Ivy League universities, including Columbia University, issued similar joint statements in support of Palestinians.  A week previously, another prominent New York City law firm, Winston & Strawn, announced it had rescinded a former summer associate\u2019s letter of employment over \u201cinflammatory comments\u201d that were distributed to the NYU Student Bar Association.

        "title": "Black entrepreneurs and DEI efforts face complaints and lawsuits \u2014 for racial discrimination",
        "content": "Just months after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in higher education, conservatives have set their sights on a new target: initiatives meant to close racial disparities in business.  Companies, governments and venture capitalists have been hit with complaints and in some cases federal lawsuits over the constitutionality of supporting minority- or Black-owned businesses. Ed Blum, a conservative activist who has led efforts to eradicate affirmative action in college admissions, has become part of this new fight. His group, American Alliance for Equal Rights, sued the Fearless Fund, a Black woman-run venture capitalist fund, to block the group from giving $20,000 to businesses primarily owned by Black women. Blum has argued that the group\u2019s Fearless Strivers Grant Contest violates civil rights law.  The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The court ruled in a 2-1 decision on Sept. 30 to halt the program, reversing an earlier federal ruling that allowed it to continue. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision and remain resolute in our mission and commitment to address the unacceptable disparities that exist for Black women and other women of color in the venture capital space,\u201d the Atlanta-based Fearless Fund said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. The Fearless Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News. Blum\u2019s efforts, though, are part of a broadening backlash against initiatives meant to boost minority-owned businesses, which are likely to be overlooked and underfunded when seeking capital and other resources. Black people represent less than 3% of business owners while making up 14.2% of the U.S. population, according to the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group. Black business owners typically receive less than 2% of all funding from venture capitalists each year, CNBC reported earlier this year. Last year, Black startup founders raised an estimated $2.254 billion out of the $215.9 billion in U.S. venture capital funds, showing a slight drop from funding in 2021, according to data by Crunchbase. Black business owners are also more likely to be offered inferior loans, even when they are stronger applicants than white peers, according to a study published this year in the Journal of Marketing Research.  In the face of such statistics, efforts to purposefully support Black-owned businesses have emerged, ranging from venture capitalists like the Fearless Fund to policies stipulating that local, state and federal governments consider or hire a certain number of minority-owned businesses for contract work.  But a growing call to thwart these efforts has been taking hold. Conservative groups and state attorneys generals have increasingly turned their attention to considerations of race in the workplace after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions in June. Meanwhile, a white couple sued the city of Houston last month over a decades-old program that set aside money for minority-owned businesses. In July, a judge dismantled part of a Small Business Administration program that deemed race a social disadvantage for entrepreneurs seeking government contracts.  Fears of such litigation are spreading, and other businesses have begun downplaying their diversity efforts to insulate themselves from lawsuits.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is surprised that these suits are going forward, and given the makeup of the current Supreme Court, it\u2019s hard to be optimistic in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace,\u201d said Erica Foldy, a professor at New York University\u2019s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Black venture capital firms and other groups that provide funding for small businesses have been swept up in this backlash. As a result, groups are fighting to keep programs that specifically benefit Black entrepreneurs, and other organizations are weighing whether to downplay their own diversity initiatives for fear of being targeted with lawsuits. The Fearless Fund has given $3.7 million to businesses through its grant programs and invested nearly $27 million in about 40 businesses owned by women of color since its founding, according to The Associated Press.  Arian Simone and actor Keshia Knight Pulliam launched the $5 million fund in 2019 specifically to support businesses created by women of color. Ayana Parsons joined later as chief operating officer. One business that has been helped by the Fearless Fund is LS Cream Liqueur, a beverage brand run by Myriam Jean-Baptiste and Stevens Charles, who are of Haitian descent.  \u201cBefore getting in with Fearless Fund I was really wondering, \u2018How are we going to get this done?\u2019\u201d Jean-Baptiste said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get funding. It\u2019s very difficult to get funding from a bank. We got an investment from Fearless Fund this year and for us it has been completely life-changing.\u201d Jean-Baptiste said they were able to hire more employees and expand the business with the Fearless Fund\u2019s investment.  While the Fearless Fund and others like it were built to close gaps between white business owners and owners of color, Blum\u2019s lawsuit said that the Fearless Fund\u2019s Strivers Grant Contest violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibits racial discrimination in contracts. He told NBC News in an email that racial disparities in funding don\u2019t justify the exclusion of \u201ccertain men and women from public programs by race or ethnicity.\u201d  He held that if a venture capital fund that exclusively benefited white men is deemed \u201cunfair and illegal,\u201d then so would a program prioritizing Black women.  \u201cThe American Alliance for Equal Rights believes it is legally permissible to provide benefits to businesses and individuals who are under-resourced, but those benefits must be made available to all races and ethnicities,\u201d Blum added. Attorneys for the Fearless Fund, including noted civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, have said the grants are protected by the First Amendment because they\u2019re donations and not contracts, according to The Associated Press. But the panel of judges rejected that argument, declaring that the First Amendment does not give the Fearless Fund the right to \u201cexclude persons from a contractual regime based on their race.\u201d  Meanwhile, America First Legal, the right-wing group run by former Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller, is leading a lawsuit against Hello Alice, a small-business-resource company, and insurer Progressive Preferred Insurance Company, as well as other Progressive entities, on behalf of a white trucker who filed a complaint because he was not eligible for a $25,000 grant program designated for Black entrepreneurs. The Driving Small Business Forward fund program, a partnership between Hello Alice and Progressive, is intended to intervene in the racial disparities that make it difficult for Black business owners to access capital.  \u201cMultiple studies have shown how inequities have made it harder for Black entrepreneurs to access capital. This program aims to alleviate this challenge,\u201d according to Hello Alice\u2019s website. According to the complaint, Nathan Roberts, an Ohio man who runs a small trucking company, began filling out an application for the grant until he realized it is intended to help Black business owners. The complaint states that Roberts brought the suit to combat \u201cthese racially discriminatory practices and recover classwide damages on behalf of everyone who has suffered unlawful racial discrimination\u201d as a result of the program. Neither Roberts nor his attorneys immediately responded to a request for comment from NBC News.  Hello Alice has been vocal about the lawsuit, sharing messages with its members and social media posts about the litigation.  \u201cIn AFL\u2019s own words, it claims \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u2019 are \u2018gentle-sounding euphemisms [that] are designed to mask a brute force agenda of social engineering, Marxist dehumanization, and overt racism and sexism,\u2019\u201d the group said in a statement on its social media platforms.  The group added in the statement: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: our values are not \u2018gentle-sounding euphemisms.\u2019 These are the pillars upon which we built Hello Alice and guide our mission to drive capital, connections, and opportunities into the hands of small businesses of all types and backgrounds.\u201d Groups like the Black Innovation Alliance, a coalition of organizations devoted to supporting Black entrepreneurs, have taken notice. The BIA last month announced its \u201cClap Back\u201d campaign, a 90-day effort to share resources and tools to bring attention to the recent attacks on DEI in business and advocate for Black communities. Kelly Burton, CEO of the BIA, said she wasn\u2019t surprised when she learned of the lawsuit against the Fearless Fund. \u201cWhen Fearless Fund was sued, we knew that it was not it. We knew we were about to experience an onslaught\u201d of these lawsuits, Burton said. \u201cWithin BIA, we have support organizations wondering if they need to scrub the word \u2018Black\u2019 from their websites. It\u2019s saying that if you see racial injustice, you can\u2019t do anything about it. And that\u2019s deeply dangerous.\u201d Another lawsuit from Blum\u2019s American Alliance for Equal Rights prompted the Morrison & Foerster law firm to change the eligibility requirements for its DEI fellowship by removing the term \u201cunderrepresented groups\u201d from its criteria, according to Bloomberg Law. The group dropped the case as a result. Eric T. McCrath, chair of the law firm, told Bloomberg that the firm is \u201cpleased by the AAER\u2019s decision not to pursue a meritless case.\u201d  Tina Opie, a DEI consultant and management professor at Babson College, said she\u2019s noticing businesses changing externally facing language \u201cbecause they think that will prevent them from being sued, and that may work in the short term, but in the long term, I don\u2019t think that just changing your language is going to cause them to sic the dogs off. If you stop talking about race \u2026 the people who are experiencing the worst disparities don\u2019t have a chance for relief. And I think that\u2019s the goal.\u201d  Foldy, of NYU, agreed that companies will have to do much more than tweak a few terms to stave off the litigation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to try to find a new rationale for serving the people they were initially founded to serve,\u201d Foldy said.

        "content": "DEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Ford Motor Executive Chair Bill Ford on Monday warned that an ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers threatens the future livelihood of the company as well as the American automotive industry. Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to \u201cend to this acrimonious round of talks.\u201d Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW. \u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d Ford said during a news conference at the company\u2019s massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. \u201cChoosing the right path is not just about Ford\u2019s future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry.\u201d Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to \u201celevate\u201d the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he didn\u2019t want to get personal in his remarks because \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d at this point. \u201cThe UAW\u2019s leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home.\u201d UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford\u2019s plea by ratcheting up the pressure. \u201cBill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up [Ford CEO] Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we\u2019ll close the Rouge for him,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It\u2019s autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy \u2014 they\u2019re the UAW members of the future.\u201d Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and \u201cfactories like the one we are in today\u201d will be lost. Ford\u2019s remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company\u2019s highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant. More than 19,000 of Ford\u2019s 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage. Ford last week said it was \u201cat the limit\u201d of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions. The company\u2019s most recent proposal included 23% to 26% wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits. Overall, only about 34,000 U.S. autoworkers with the companies \u2014 or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers \u2014 are currently on strike. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. Fain last week said the union has entered a \u201cnew phase\u201d of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been. Fain has said it\u2019s ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership. Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford\u2019s nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month. \u201cI trust Shawn Fain,\u201d said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. \u201cAll the steps he\u2019s taken, it\u2019s for the cause.\u201d Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she\u2019d like it to come to a resolution, but \u201cit\u2019s worth it.\u201d She later added, \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides \u201cwould come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later.\u201d He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company\u2019s proposals. Nichol, who\u2019s been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it\u2019s an \u201cunpopular opinion,\u201d but he\u2019d support Ford\u2019s current proposal, including a 23% wage increase. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we\u2019re off, that also plays into how long it\u2019s going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week.\u201d Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about $4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike.

        "title": "Rite Aid bankruptcy means pharmacies will keep dwindling",
        "content": "Rite Aid, the third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday, and it's likely the company will close a big chunk of its 2,000 stores. One result is that people will have fewer options for where they fill their prescriptions. That has been the trend in drugstores lately, and it looks like they'll dwindle further. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Rite Aid might close 400 to 500 stores as part of bankruptcy proceedings. (The company hasn't confirmed the report.) CVS is closing 300 stores per year, a process that began last year and is expected to continue into next year, and Walgreens announced in June that it would close about 150 U.S. stores by next summer. At the same time, big box chains and grocery stores like Walmart and Target are opening pharmacies in their stores, and more people are getting their medications delivered through apps. So a consumer reading this news might think, \"So what? Nobody likes going to drugstores.\" And that's partly the point. Drugstores have done the wrong thing over and over again, said Neil Saunders, the managing director at the consulting company GlobalData. The result is that people don't want to shop at them, and that has made lots of openings for competitors. \u201cYou go into the store, usually they're badly lit, they are fairly depressing, there isn't lot of great customer service, the products are locked very often, there aren't enough staff to help, the prices are very expensive relative to other retailers,\u201d Saunders told NBC News. \"They've shot themselves in the foot, and now they're reaping the consequences of all those years of poor decisions and underinvestment.\u201d Rite Aid's bankruptcy filing wasn't a surprise, because the 60-year-old chain has been in dire financial shape for a long time. It has lost money in each of its last six fiscal years, it had already been closing stores to cut spending, and it was looking at a $1 billion charge related to its role in the opioid crisis. CVS and Walgreens have paid similar settlements, but it was much harder for Rite Aid to do so. In recent years, the stock market has valued Rite Aid in the tens of millions of dollars even though it had $24 billion in sales last year. Rite Aid's downfall arguably dates to its purchase of the Brooks and Eckerd chains in 2007. The company borrowed money to pay for the deal and also assumed some of the debt of Brooks and Eckerd's former parent company, the Canadian drugstore company Jean Coutu Group. At one point, Rite Aid agreed to be bought by Walgreens, but the deal fell through. Walgreens ultimately sold almost 2,000 stores, and Rite Aid unsuccessfully pursued other deals to stabilize its business. The company had $3.3 billion in long-term debt as of June 3. All that debt made it harder for Rite Aid to invest in its stores or to expand and branch out into new businesses the way its rivals did. CVS now has more than 1,000 clinics in its stores, and it bought a pharmacy benefits manager and a health insurer over the years. Walgreens and CVS both expanded into some types of primary care, as well. But Saunders said all three have neglected their stores as they have prioritized the health care parts of their businesses over the retail parts. \"They are not good retailers. None of them,\" he said. \"They just haven't really evolved and changed with the times at all.\" As Rite Aid shrinks even further, it will create opportunities for all of its rivals to boost their sales. Saunders said there will always be a place for physical pharmacies. \"We're still going to have a physical pharmacy retail space, but it's going to be somewhat smaller than it has been traditionally,\" he said.

        "title": "Flood of Israel-Hamas war misinformation is 'close to impossible' to track",
        "content": "Researchers sifting through social media content about the Israel-Hamas conflict say it\u2019s getting harder to verify information and track the spread of misleading material, adding to the digital fog of war. As misinformation and violent content surrounding the war proliferate online, social media companies\u2019 pullbacks in moderation and other policy shifts have made it \u201cclose to impossible\u201d to do the work researchers were able to do less than a year ago, said Rebekah Tromble, the director of George Washington University\u2019s Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics. \u201cIt has become much more difficult for researchers to collect and analyze meaningful data to understand what\u2019s actually happening on any of these platforms,\u201d she said. Much attention has focused on X, formerly known as Twitter, which has made significant changes since Elon Musk bought it for $44 billion late last year. In the days after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, researchers flagged dozens of accounts pushing a coordinated disinformation campaign related to the war, and a separate report from the Technology Transparency Project found Hamas has used premium accounts on X to spread propaganda videos. The latter issue comes after X began offering blue check marks to premium users for subscriptions starting at $8 a month, rather than applying the badge to those whose identities it had verified. That has made it harder to distinguish the accounts of journalists, public figures and institutions from those of potential impostors, experts say. \u201cOne of the things that is touted for that [premium] service is that you get prioritized algorithmic ranking and searches,\u201d Technology Transparency Project Director Katie Paul said. Hamas propaganda is getting the same treatment, she said, \u201cwhich is making it even easier to find these videos that are also being monetized by the platform.\u201d X is far from the only major social media company coming under scrutiny during the conflict. Paul said that X used to be an industry leader in combating online misinformation but that in the past year it has spearheaded a movement toward a more hands-off approach. \u201cThat leadership role has remained, but in the reverse direction,\u201d she said, adding that the Hamas videos highlight what she described as platforms\u2019 business incentives to embrace looser content moderation. \u201cCompanies have cut costs by laying off thousands of moderators, all while continuing to monetize harmful content that perpetuates on their platforms.\u201d Paul pointed to ads that ran alongside Facebook search results related to the 2022 Buffalo, New York, mass shooting video while it circulated online, as well as findings by the Technology Transparency Project and the Anti-Defamation League that YouTube previously auto-generated \u201cart tracks,\u201d or music with static images, for white power content that it monetized with ads. A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment on the Buffalo incident. The company said at the time that it was committed to protecting users from encountering violent content. YouTube said in a statement it doesn\u2019t want to profit from hate and has since \u201cterminated several YouTube channels noted in ADL\u2019s report.\u201d X responded with an automated message: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d The deep cuts to \u201ctrust and safety\u201d teams at many major platforms, which came in a broader wave of tech industry layoffs beginning late last year, drew warnings at the time about backsliding on efforts to police abusive content \u2014 especially during global crises. We\u2019re left being completely unclear what\u2019s really happening on the ground. CLAIRE WARDLE, CO-DIRECTOR OF BROWN UNIVERSITY'S INFORMATION FUTURES LAB Some social media companies have changed their moderation policies since then, researchers say, and existing rules are sometimes being enforced differently or unevenly. \u201cToday in conflict situations, information is one of the most important weapons,\u201d said Claire Wardle, a co-director of the Information Futures Lab at Brown University. Many are now successfully pushing \u201cfalse narratives to support their cause,\u201d she said, but \u201cwe\u2019re left being completely unclear what\u2019s really happening on the ground.\u201d Experts are encountering more roadblocks to accessing social media platforms\u2019 application programming interfaces, or APIs, which allow third parties to gather more detailed information from an app than what\u2019s available from user-facing features. Some major platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, have long limited access to their APIs. Over the past year, Reddit joined X in reducing free use of its API, though it waives its charges for noncommercial research. The most basic access to X\u2019s API now starts at $100 a month and can run up to $42,000 a month for enterprise use. TikTok has taken steps in the other direction. It launched a research API this year in the U.S. as part of a transparency push after having fielded national security concerns from Western authorities over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. YouTube said it has already removed thousands of harmful videos and is \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to \u201ctake action quickly\u201d against abusive activity. Reddit said its safety teams are monitoring for policy violations during the war, including content posted by legally designated terrorist groups. TikTok said it has added \u201cresources to help prevent violent, hateful or misleading content on our platform\u201d and is working with fact-checkers \u201cto help assess the accuracy of content in this rapidly changing environment.\u201d \u201cMy biggest worry is the offline consequence,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, the senior counsel and director of digital justice at the media watchdog Free Press. \u201cReal people will suffer more because they are desperate for credible information quickly. They soak in what they see from platforms, and the platforms have largely abandoned and are in the process of abandoning their promises to keep their environments healthy.\u201d Real people will suffer more because they are desperate for credible information quickly. They soak in what they see. NORA BENAVIDEZ, FREE PRESS SENIOR COUNSEL AND DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL JUSTICE Another obstacle during the current conflict, Tromble said, is that Meta has allowed key tools such as CrowdTangle to degrade. \u201cJournalists and researchers, both in academia and civil society, used [CrowdTangle] extensively to study and understand the spread of mis- and disinformation and other sorts of problematic content,\u201d Tromble said. \u201cThe team behind that tool is no longer at Meta, and its features aren\u2019t being maintained, and it\u2019s just becoming worse and worse to use.\u201d That change and others across social media mean \u201cwe simply don\u2019t have nearly as much high-quality verifiable information to inform decision-making,\u201d Tromble said. Where once researchers could sift through data in real time and \u201cshare that with law enforcement and executive agencies\u201d relatively quickly, \u201cthat is effectively impossible now.\u201d The Meta spokesperson declined to comment on CrowdTangle but pointed to the company\u2019s statement Friday that it is working to intercept and moderate misinformation and graphic content involving the Israel-Hamas war. The company, which has rolled out additional research tools this year, said it has \u201cremoved seven times as many pieces of content\u201d for violating its policies compared with the two months preceding the Hamas attack. Resources remain tight for examining how social media content affects the public, said Zeve Sanderson, the founding executive director at New York University\u2019s Center for Social Media and Politics. \u201cResearchers really don\u2019t have either a wide or deep perspective onto the platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to understand how those pieces of misinformation are fitting into an overall information ecosystem at a particular moment in time, that\u2019s where the current data-access landscape is especially limiting.\u201d Sara Ruberg is an associate producer with NBC News.

        "title": "Rite Aid files for bankruptcy protection amid slowing sales, opioid litigation",
        "content": "Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey on Sunday and said it would begin restructuring to significantly reduce its debt. The company appointed Jeffrey Stein as its new chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer as well as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company\u2019s board. Rite Aid Chairman Bruce Bodaken said in a statement, \u201cJeff is a proven leader with a strong track record of guiding companies through financial restructurings. We look forward to benefitting from his contributions and leveraging his expertise as we strengthen Rite Aid\u2019s foundation and position the business for long-term success.\u201d Stein said he has \u201ctremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.\u201d The beleaguered drugstore chain has been grappling with slowing sales, mounting debt and a slew of lawsuits that allege the company helped fuel the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic by oversupplying painkillers.  During its most recent quarter ended June 3, revenue fell to $5.6 billion, down from $6.01 billion in the year-ago period. Net losses widened to $306.7 million, or $5.56 per share, compared to a net loss of $110.2 million, or $2.03 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  As a result of the rough quarter, Rite Aid lowered its fiscal 2024 outlook and warned investors it expects to lose between $650 million and $680 million for the full year, which is slated to end in late February. Rite Aid\u2019s retail pharmacy segment has long been a key growth driver for the company, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset its mounting losses. Plummeting demand for Covid vaccines and testing, a membership reduction in the company\u2019s prescription drug plan and a loss of customers from its Elixir pharmacy benefits business have contributed to a slowdown in revenue at the struggling drug chain. Drugstores like Rite Aid have faced an existential crisis as shoppers increasingly turn to retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart and others for toothpaste, shampoo and other staples \u2014 often at a cheaper price and with the convenience of delivery to customers\u2019 doors. Rite Aid has also struggled to keep up with its bigger rivals, CVS and Walgreens, as those companies have pivoted to a health care focus and made sizable investments to match. CVS has opened in-store Minute Clinics, which resemble walk-in urgent care facilities, and turned more of its stores into HealthHubs, or locations with a longer list of medical services.  It has expanded its reach in health care by acquiring Caremark, one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, health insurer Aetna and, most recently, primary-care company Oak Street Health. Walgreens has also struck pricey deals to expand its reach in health care. It\u2019s become the majority owner of primary-care company VillageMD and plans to open up doctor offices next to many of its drugstores.  Newer \u2014 and well-capitalized \u2014 health-care entrants have also intensified the competitive threat. Amazon closed its acquisition of primary-care provider One Medical in a $3.9 billion deal earlier this year and acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Walmart, which has pharmacies in its thousands of stores, has opened a growing network of medical clinics in parts of the country. Rite Aid\u2019s financial position and competitive disadvantages are compounded by the many lawsuits it\u2019s facing that allege the company contributed to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic by knowingly filling prescriptions for painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. The Department of Justice filed a suit against Rite Aid earlier this year, claiming that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling thousands of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances such as fentanyl and oxycodone. Rite Aid has asked a court to dismiss the department\u2019s lawsuit and denied allegations that it filled unlawful opioid prescriptions. \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Christine Wang contributed to this report.

        "title": "Amid millions of open jobs, finding work remains a struggle with a criminal record",
        "content": "For nearly three years, Tonya Jones went on one job interview after another, only to be passed over for positions and have offers rescinded when background checks revealed a misdemeanor food stamp fraud conviction on her record.  She was removed as a driver for Lyft when the company\u2019s background check turned up the charge, and despite her years of experience working in finance and plentiful available job openings, her main source of income until recently was delivering food for DoorDash in the Cleveland area.  \u201cWhen I would try to apply for jobs that kept popping up, it was just like slamming the door in my face,\u201d said Jones, who denies she broke the law and is fighting to remove the conviction from her record. \u201cWith that charge, nobody would give me a chance. I was just really, really, really in a dark place. It was just so emotionally draining.\u201d In an economy with historically low unemployment and millions of open jobs, it remains a tale of two job markets for many with criminal records who continue to struggle to find employment, according to interviews with job seekers and nonprofit organizations that work with them. They say that while employers have appeared more willing to hire workers with criminal records, a tangle of obstacles remains for those workers trying to find stable employment. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d said Christopher Watler, the executive vice president of the Center for Employment Opportunities, a nonprofit organization that provides jobs and training to people who have been incarcerated. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of times in that companies now talk openly about second-chance hiring; we have more examples of how employers can be successful hiring talent with past convictions. At the same time, we have huge barriers that remain. We have to address those barriers. It\u2019s not the motivation of people wanting to work. Folks want to work.\u201d Groups that work with formerly incarcerated job seekers said employers\u2019 interest has increased as the job market has tightened. With 650,000 people being released from state and federal prisons every year and studies showing the unemployment rate of those formerly incarcerated at around 30%, the group of workers remains an untapped source of prospective labor to fill some of the 9 million job openings employers reported in August.  \u201cThe threshold has been lowered to a certain extent by some companies because they are willing to, let's call it, take a risk that they might not have been willing to take in the past,\" said Ronald Day, the vice president of programs and research for the Fortune Society, which works with formerly incarcerated job seekers in the New York area. \"But that\u2019s because of the shift in the labor force. They didn\u2019t wake up one morning and say: \u2018You know what? I just want to give these individuals a chance.\u2019\u201d Job candidates say interest from employers often collides with other barriers, like lack of training or job placement support and regulations preventing them from working in a variety of professions. Then there are struggles to adjust to life after incarceration, like meeting parole requirements, finding affordable housing and getting treatment for mental health conditions. Dion Johnson ran headfirst into some of those barriers. After he attended a job fair, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey hired him last fall to work as a janitor at LaGuardia Airport in New York. But after a month on the job, he was fired when a background check came back showing he had served six years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm, a violation that prevented him from getting clearance to work past airport security checkpoints.  \u201cWhen you tell someone this is where you have to go as a punishment as a result of an act that you committed, understandable. But then you don\u2019t provide any training or any tools or give them anything to help themselves on the way up,\u201d said Johnson, 48, who lives in New York. \u201cNow they\u2019re in society and they\u2019re going to look for work, but they can\u2019t find anything because no one will hire them, not even as a lower-level janitor.\u201d In New York, like three dozen other states, it is illegal for employers to ask prospective employees about their criminal histories in the job application process. But once employers have made candidates conditional offers, they are allowed to run criminal background checks and can rescind the offers under certain circumstances based on the findings.  The Port Authority, which operates LaGuardia, started a program in 2020 focused on hiring workers with criminal backgrounds, and it has since placed 121 candidates in airport jobs, like taxi dispatcher, traffic attendant, customer service and food service, it said. But federal regulations require security clearance for access to areas past Transportation Security Administration screening locations, which can prevent some candidates, like Johnson, from getting those jobs.  The challenges are particularly acute for those with drug and violent crime offenses. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found about 75% of hiring managers said they were unwilling to seriously consider applicants convicted of drug, property or violent crimes in a 2021 survey. Ella, who asked that her last name not be used, said she has had a string of rejections since she was released from prison in May after having served 2\u00bd years for attempted murder. In one instance, she was offered a job working for the U.S. Postal Service, but after two months it was rescinded when her background check was completed. \u201cI felt hopeless, depressed. You feel like you\u2019re just back at square one, and it just takes a lot of faith and your support system from your family and friends to help you out and pull you out of that bad funk,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a whole list of all these jobs that are hiring because everyone needs help, and they\u2019re going to waive the background check and everything like that. Then when you go through the process, they tell you no.\u201d  The Postal Service said in a statement that it conducts background checks on all new applicants after conditional offers are made and that criminal convictions are not automatic reasons for denial. The decision to retain an applicant is based on the nature of the offense, the length of time since the offense and how it relates to the job duties, the statement said. Before her conviction, Ella, who has her degree in mortuary sciences, was working toward becoming a funeral director. But she abandoned her plans to get her funeral director\u2019s license after she was told she would be likely to face a period of suspension and have to pay a fine because of her conviction. In Pennsylvania, where she lives, the state board eased its policy about granting licenses to those with criminal convictions in 2020, but it can still deny a license if it determines an offense would pose a risk to the health and safety of clients or the public.   A number of states restrict issuing licenses to people with convictions in a variety of professions \u2014 from cosmetology to social work \u2014 which can create barriers even when employers are willing to hire them. Texas may deny professional licenses for occupations like electrician, tow truck operator and air conditioning and refrigeration contractor depending on the convictions. In Arizona, convicted felons cannot get real estate licenses while they are on probation, which can last years for some. \u201cYou have people who have been barbers inside corrections for years, and then they come out and they try to get a barber license, and they are denied,\u201d Day said. \u201cThat is this person\u2019s livelihood; that\u2019s how they make money legally and what that person has been doing for 30 years.\u201d Roy Ballard said he received no training while he was in prison for 16 years in California or help with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or job hunting skills ahead of his release. When he was released in March 2022, he said, he was dropped off at a transit station with some money on a debit card, no identification other than his prison ID and no housing assistance.  \u201cThere was nothing, no vouchers, no help, no assistance, no list of resources, nothing,\u201d said Ballard, 64, who worked in upper management for a food manufacturing company before his incarceration. \u201cOne of the parole agents told me that he tells the guys that come to my county, you're f\u2019ed.\u201d Ballard has been able to find several temporary jobs doing highway work and with the Center for Employment Opportunities working with others who had been incarcerated. He is working on his college degree and continues to look for full-time work. He said a variety of barriers keep people in positions similar to his from finding stable jobs \u2014  from employers unwilling to hire them to personal struggles re-entering society.  \u201cThere are so many factors in all this. Housing is a big one, your previous training, your mental health, any addictions that people still suffer with,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cI have encountered others who were hooked up with a job when they got out and within a week or two they were fired. They are just thrown back out.\u201d Advocates say things are beginning to change for the better. In Michigan, the Corrections Department cannot keep up with the number of requests it gets from employers for inmates being trained through its Vocational Village program, said Kyle Kaminski, who oversees education and re-entry efforts. \"Quite honestly, we have a lot more employer demand than we have candidates at this point,\" Kaminski said. The immersive, full-day training program, which lasts nine to 12 months, prepares around 400 inmates at a time for a number of trades after they are released and connects them to employers. \u201cWhen we started the first village, we had to cold-call employers and try to get them to come see it, because they just weren\u2019t super interested. We sort of had to pull on the heartstrings,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cNow the pendulum is completely on the other side. We are being called by  multiple employers every week saying: \u2018We need people with the following skill set. We need people coming back to the following communities. Do you have folks?\u2019\u201d The demand from employers has helped improve the employment rate for graduates of the program, which went from 59% who were employed after their releases in 2019 to 71% last year.   After he lost his job at the airport, Johnson began working for the Center for Employment Opportunity and went through its job training program. After several months applying for at least five jobs a week, he was offered a job this month at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital making $21 an hour helping people leaving incarceration get the services they need.   Jones, after having had at least 10 job prospects fall through, was recently able to land a job at a large financial company in the Cleveland area making $24 an hour, getting her back on the career path she was on before her conviction.  \u201cWhen HR did run my background check, she didn\u2019t even care. She told me, \u2018Oh, no, we look for more serious things than that,\u2019\u201d said Jones, who asked that her employer not be identified. \u201cThey don\u2019t discriminate against you. They were willing to give me a shot.\" Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News digital. ",

        "title": "Big moments from the beginning of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial",
        "content": "Two of the people closest to Sam Bankman-Fried were asked the same question as they began their testimony this week: Did they commit financial crimes while they were working at FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that crumbled last fall? Both Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison answered \"Yes.\" While the finer points of cryptocurrencies, financial market trading and securities law can seem dizzying, the most striking moments in the first two weeks of Bankman-Fried's trial have been relatively simple. Here's a rundown of some of the key moments from the trial so far: The government began its case not with an FTX insider but with a commodities broker named Marc-Antoine Julliard, who said he invested $100,000 with FTX. Julliard testified that he decided to buy digital currencies to diversify his investments and that he bought through FTX because it had attracted so much media coverage and because of the celebrities and investment funds involved with it. He said he didn't make any risky trades but lost almost all of his investment when FTX failed. Prosecutors called him to represent typical investors who, according to the government, lost money because Bankman-Fried and his co-workers fooled those investors and spent the money on themselves or gave it to lenders to Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund. Bankman-Fried's lawyers argue that he didn\u2019t defraud anyone, that startups like FTX are complex and often fail and that the government is looking for someone to blame for customers' losses. Bankman-Fried, whose stake in FTX and Alameda Research was once estimated to be worth as much as $26 billion on paper, faces seven decades in jail on a series of federal charges related to oversight of the now-bankrupt firms. Adam Yedidia was a college friend of Bankman-Fried's at MIT and worked as a software engineer for FTX in 2021-22. He said that he informed Bankman-Fried in June 2022 that $8 billion in FTX customers' cash was missing and that they later discussed the missing money in person. He said Bankman-Fried seemed unusually nervous during their conversation and acknowledged that FTX was vulnerable. Even so, Yedidia said, he trusted Bankman-Fried. In November, when the business was collapsing and people were leaving, he wrote to him on Signal: \"I love you Sam. I'm not going anywhere.\" Yedidia said that changed when he learned FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to Alameda's creditors, which he said was \"flagrantly wrong.\" After that, he resigned. He was then asked why he lost faith in the company and quit. \"FTX defrauded all its customers,\" Yedidia said. The answer was stricken from the court record. Bankman-Fried appeared visibly upset at times during the testimony of FTX co-founder and technology chief Gary Wang. He looked at the ground at times and once put his head in his hands while Wang was on the stand. Wang told the court about the days before Alameda and FTX failed. He said the firm's leaders considered shutting Alameda down but couldn't because it owed roughly $14 billion and had no way to pay it back. Asked about a tweet by Bankman-Fried that said, \"Assets are fine,\" Wang said, \"FTX was not fine, and assets were not fine.\" Alameda\u2019s CEO, Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, said he told her to steal $10 billion from FTX\u2019s customers and use it to repay firms that had lent money to Alameda. \u201cSam directed me to commit these crimes,\u201d Ellison said near the beginning of several days of testimony. She also testified that Bankman-Fried instructed her to mislead lenders to make the firm's finances look better than they actually were \u2014 a way to stop those lenders from getting nervous and asking for their money back. Ellison's personal relationship with Bankman-Fried was discussed at times during her testimony. While Ellison was on the stand for three full days, the two appeared to avoid looking at each other throughout. Ellison broke down in tears after prosecutors shared messages in which she told Bankman-Fried that she was relieved that the truth about FTX and Alameda was finally coming out. Ellison, like Wang and another top FTX executive, Nishad Singh, have pleaded guilty to a series of fraud-related criminal charges and are cooperating with the prosecution in the hope of reducing their own prison sentences. Christian Drappi, a former software engineer for Alameda, testified about the final days before FTX and Alameda failed. He said Ellison told him that FTX had a \"shortfall\" of users' funds because Alameda had been borrowing them. He said he was shocked to learn about that. While Drappi was on the stand, the prosecution played a recording of a company meeting led by Ellison. It was secretly taped by another employee, who gave it to Drappi. In the recording, Ellison tells employees that FTX doesn't have enough funds to give all of its users their money back and that it is trying to raise funds. Drappi says he's surprised because a firm would usually raise money to fund it operations, not to \"fill a hole in a company\u2019s balance sheet.\" He then asks Ellison whether the loan was collateralized in a standard way. She says it wasn't. \"That seems pretty bad,\" he says. Drappi resigned from Alameda the next day. The final witness of the week was Zac Prince. He's also the CEO of a crypto company that went under \u2014 not an exchange like FTX, where digital currencies like Bitcoin are traded, but a company that lent to other businesses in the industry. Prince's company, BlockFi, lent more than $1 billion to Alameda Research over a few years, and he said it always made payments on time. He said that he also saw Alameda's balance sheets every quarter and that, based on those, he thought the company was in very good shape. He said he didn't know Alameda was taking money from FTX or know about loans it made to insiders like Bankman-Fried, and he said he wouldn't have lent to Alameda had he known the true state of its finances. When the crypto market fell sharply in mid-2022, BlockFi was also hit hard. It struck a deal with FTX in which it borrowed from BlockFi, and it also had an option to buy it. It also made more loans to Alameda. Prince testified that BlockFi had $350 million on FTX late last year. He said it ultimately lost $1 billion when Alameda and FTX filed for bankruptcy and testified that it wouldn't have happened if Alameda had been able to pay back its loans.

        "title": "Are Miami Beach's Art Deco buildings in danger from developers?",
        "content": "Many of the historic Art Deco buildings that give Miami Beach its distinctive character may be vulnerable to demolition under proposals from three Florida legislators who critics say are using concerns about building safety and the need for affordable housing to help developers. The Resiliency and Safe Structures Act was introduced in the state Legislature in March by Rep. Spencer Roach and Sen. Bryan Avila, both Republicans, as a way to replace unsafe buildings with stronger, \u201cresilient\u201d construction. The legislation would allow developers to replace historic buildings with massive towers and provide incentives for owners to stop maintaining historic properties, preservationists say. The act passed the state Senate but was tabled in the House shortly before the session ended in May. Roach told NBC News he is \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the language in his bill and plans to propose it again during the next legislative session in January. In June, state Rep. Fabi\u00e1n Basabe, a Republican from Miami Beach, proposed letting developers demolish older residential buildings and temporarily relocate their tenants while safer, more modern structures are built. In a statement emailed to NBC News, Basabe said his proposal was \u201ca conversation starter of a more comprehensive plan to offset costs of repairing what we have and not displacing our long-time residents.\u201d \u201cDevastating,\u201d said Dolly MacIntyre, a co-founder of the Dade Heritage Trust, Miami preservation nonprofit organization. \u201cMost of our historic properties are in the coastal district of the state, and [the proposals] call for anything within a flood zone to be eligible for demolition if the owner so wished.\u201d  Daniel Ciraldo of the Miami Design Preservation League agreed. \u201cThe postcard of our whole South Florida region is all at risk based on these extremists\u2019 proposals,\u201d he said.  A legislative aide to Avila said he has not discussed the possibility of reintroducing the bill. In his statement to NBC News, Basabe said, \u201cMy goal is to be realistic, fix what we\u2019ve got, preserve our brand identity and local communities while welcoming an inevitable future with open arms and proactive measures. I don\u2019t want our residents to be displaced.\" Developers who might benefit from changes to the current laws include owners of properties in historic Miami Beach, according to Ciraldo and MacIntyre. The proposals would override existing restrictions on development and create incentives to erect bigger buildings. A prime example is a vacant six-floor apartment building on Collins Avenue built in the Art Deco style in 1947. 13th Floor Investments, a Miami-based developer of residential and commercial properties, owns the complex, according to city planning documents. Under current law, the developer is limited to replacing the property with another six-story structure, but if the proposed bill goes through, it would be able to build a high-rise there. MacIntyre, Ciraldo and others are particularly worried about the famed Art Deco row on Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue, home to the Greystone Hotel, the Breakwater Hotel and additional landmarks that contributed to the revival of South Beach in the 1980s and the 1990s. Only buildings on the National Register of Historic Places would be protected from demolition under the Resiliency and Safe Structures Act, and just seven buildings in Miami Beach are on the register. The historic Deauville Hotel, built in 1957 in the Miami Modern style, has already been torn down and is now a vacant lot. The Miami Design Preservation League believes the case is an example of demolition by neglect, in which a property owner lets a building fall into disrepair so it can be torn down and replaced with a bigger structure. The league tweeted that on the day the Deauville was demolished. The owners of the Deauville when it was condemned in 2021 have denied neglecting the property, saying they had spent millions to preserve it. They did not respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s still unclear what\u2019s in store for the Deauville site. In November, Miami Beach voters rejected a referendum measure that would have let Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, build a luxury condo and hotel tower there. Ross bought the site in May 2022, and the condemned structure was demolished in November. Alex Fernandez, who is on the commission that, with the mayor, governs Miami Beach, believes the Resiliency and Safe Structures Act is part of an attempt by Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature to strip local governments of their authority over land use and development. Fernandez points to another bill recently signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis that limits municipalities\u2019 control over zoning codes. Called the Live Local Act and passed as a solution to the state\u2019s affordable housing crisis, it lets developers override strict zoning codes if they construct more dwellings for people with lower incomes. However, the law mandates that only 10% of those new units be labeled as \u201caffordable. \u201cIn Miami Beach, increases in [building] density could only be approved by the electorate\u201d before the law was passed, Fernandez said. \u201cThen Tallahassee came in and not only stripped that power away from the local electorate, they pre-empted the will of our voters.\u201d Ciraldo believes the Florida legislators are using the catastrophic Surfside condo collapse in 2021, in which 98 residents of a beachfront tower just north of Miami Beach died, as an excuse to push the bill forward. \u201cUnfortunately, that tragedy has kind of been used by some policymakers to say, \u2018It\u2019s time to redevelop all of the coastlines, and let\u2019s knock everything down; we\u2019ll build all luxury condominiums and then everything will be safe,\u2019\u201d Ciraldo said. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably a false premise.\u201d Amid pushback from historic preservation nonprofit groups this spring, Roach and Avila added exemptions to their proposed legislation that would appear to protect certain communities over others. Some of the carve-outs include municipalities with populations of 10,000 residents or less and cities with at least three buildings over 200 years old. Miami Beach did not qualify for those exemptions. In addition, the bill exempts structures in communities labeled \u201careas of critical state concern.\u201d The cities of Arcadia and Punta Gorda carry that label and are in Roach\u2019s district. Public records show that 13th Floor Investments donated over $10,000 to the Friends of Spencer Roach political action committee, as well as $11,000 to the Fighting for Florida\u2019s Families PC, a political committee associated with Avila. 13th Floor Investments did not respond to an email seeking comment, and Roach did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of the exemptions in his district. The firm\u2019s contributions to the two legislators were first reported by The Miami Herald. In a statement to the Herald, 13th Floor Investments said its donations were unrelated to the Resiliency and Safe Structures Act. Several developers with their eyes on Miami Beach properties in Basabe\u2019s district are also Basabe donors, public records show. Since 2020, Basabe has received at least $15,000 from real estate entities. One is David P. Wallack, who owns Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe, a restaurant and nightclub at 900 Ocean Drive in Miami Beach\u2019s Art Deco District. In late 2020, Wallack was negotiating to buy three properties adjacent to the club on Collins Avenue, aiming to sell the buildings to a developer who would then construct a multiuse commercial complex, the Herald reported. The deal did not go through. Wallack and companies he owns contributed at least $5,000 to Basabe\u2019s campaign in 2022. In an email, Wallack said he was unaware of Basabe\u2019s redevelopment proposal. Basabe also received a $5,000 donation from Dezer Properties, a prominent real estate company that owns buildings in New York and Sunny Isles Beach, a community north of Miami Beach. Dezer Properties is operated by Michael Dezer, a prominent donor to former President Donald Trump; the two worked together to develop two Trump Tower condo complexes in Sunny Isles Beach. Another Basabe donor, Russell W. Galbut, is a prominent Miami real estate developer and philanthropist. He donated at least $3,500 to Basabe during the 2022 election season, mostly in payments of $500 from five different companies. Galbut submitted plans last year to construct a 20-story, 125-unit condo complex in North Miami Beach, according to The Real Deal. Neither Galbut nor Dezer responded to requests for comment.

        "content": "Kaiser Permanente and labor unions reached a tentative deal Friday morning, a little more than a week after workers at the nation\u2019s largest health care nonprofit organization went on strike. The three-day walkout was the largest work stoppage of health care workers in U.S. history, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. \"The frontline healthcare workers of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions are excited to have reached a tentative agreement with Kaiser Permanente as of this morning. We are thankful for the instrumental support of Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su,\" the coalition said in a Facebook statement. Kaiser Permanente, which serves nearly 13 million people nationwide, shared a similar statement on Facebook. The two sides agreed to a four-year deal that will give coalition members new minimum wages over three years that will reach $25 an hour in California and $23 an hour in other states, Kaiser said. Under the new tentative agreement, union workers are \"guaranteed across-the-board wage increases totaling 21% over four years,\" the enhancement of \"employees' Performance Sharing Plan with minimum payout opportunities and a substantial maximum payout opportunity,\" and more investments in job training and development. More than 75,000 union members had walked out after the company and labor negotiators failed to come to an agreement on staffing levels. The union wanted better pay and benefits for its members as well as a long-term solution to the staffing shortage. Kaiser said the new agreement will help address the staffing issue.   Workers including pharmacists, vocational nurses, housekeepers, medical assistants, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, and respiratory therapists left hospitals and medical facilities at 6 a.m. local time on Oct. 4. The strike also included employees who served in Washington state, Oregon, California and Colorado, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Sarah Levesque, the secretary-treasurer for OPEIU Local 2, previously told NBC News\u2019 Tom Costello, that workers could not adequately do their jobs because of staffing issues. \"These people got into health care because they wanted to take care of patients, and they\u2019re just stretched too thin,\" she said. \"It\u2019s taking up to three months to get appointments with some of the doctors.\" Many others expressed similar sentiments. Lorena Jackson, who works in scheduling in primary care in Aurora, Colorado, said that some patients had waited more than a month to be seen by a physician. David Hawa, an ambulatory care pharmacist in Springfield, Virginia, said he's experienced \"frustrated customers on the phone or in line.\" Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency said it would close its account on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, because of increasing intolerance of minorities expressed by users on the site, and urged other bodies to follow suit. The rapid spread of misleading claims and doctored images in the aftermath of a deadly rampage by Hamas gunmen in Israel over the weekend has put renewed focus on Elon Musk\u2019s platform, which most recently drew the ire of the European Union. Due to a surge in racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, trans and queer hostility and other misanthropic content, \u201cX is no longer a sustainable environment for a public agency\u201d, the agency\u2019s commissioner, Ferda Ataman, said in a statement. German government officials have so far resisted calls to quit X, saying there was no substitute channel at present through which leaders like Chancellor Olaf Scholz are able to reach a broad swathe of the public online. X officials couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment on the Germany agency\u2019s decision. X said on Tuesday it had taken steps to curb the spread of inappropriate posts over the past few days, and removed newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts as part of efforts to \u201cprevent terrorist content from being distributed online.\u201d The German anti-discrimination agency could only deal with the massive rise in hate comments by throwing more staff at the problem, which was a questionable use of tax money, Ataman said. Other state agencies and government ministries should ask themselves whether it made sense to remain on a platform that has \u201cbecome a disinformation network,\u201d she said. Germany\u2019s foreign, economy and finance ministries, as well as the government still maintain profiles on X, though Economy Minister Robert Habeck has not had a presence there since 2019. ",

        "title": "UAW president warns new walkouts could happen at any time amid ongoing strike",
        "content": "DETROIT \u2014 The United Auto Workers union isn\u2019t adding any factories to those that are now on strike, but its president says more walkouts could begin at any moment. Until this week the union had been announcing additional factories on Fridays. But UAW President Shawn Fain told workers in a live video appearance that the companies started gaming the system, waiting until Fridays to make progress in bargaining. \u201cWe will be calling out plants when we need to, where we need to, with little notice,\u201d Fain said on Friday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re not sticking to one pattern or one system of giving these companies an extra hour or an extra day. They know what needs to happen and they know how to get it done.\u201d Fain said the union is still bargaining hard with General Motors and Jeep maker Stellantis. But he criticized Ford, which said Thursday that it had reached the limit of how much money it will spend to settle the strike. \u201cI found a pathetic irony in that statement,\u201d Fain said, adding that it\u2019s workers who have reached their limits by not getting raises for a decade and giving up what he called retirement security. His statements came four weeks after the union began its walkouts against the Detroit automakers on Sept. 15. The strikes started with one assembly plant from each company. The union later added 38 parts warehouses at GM and Stellantis, and then one assembly factory each from Ford and GM. The UAW then made a surprise move on Wednesday, escalating the strikes by adding a huge Ford pickup truck and SUV plant in Kentucky. About 33,700 workers are on strike against the companies. Analysts say parts supply companies, especially smaller ones without a lot of cash reserves, will be squeezed as the strikes go on. The head of Ford\u2019s combustion engine vehicle unit said Thursday that the company had reached its limit for the amount of money it will spend to reach a deal with the union. Kumar Galhotra, president of the Ford Blue business unit, told reporters Thursday that the company stretched to get to the offer it now has on the table that includes a 23% pay raise over four years and other benefit increases. \u201cWe have been very clear we are at the limit,\u201d he said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe risk the ability to invest in the business and profitably grow. And profitable growth is in the best interest of everybody at Ford.\u201d The company has a set amount of money, but is willing to move dollars around in a way that might fit the union\u2019s needs, Galhotra said, adding that he still thinks it\u2019s possible to reach a deal. But Fain told workers Friday that the union added the Kentucky plant after Ford presented an economic offer Wednesday with no more money than a proposal from two weeks ago. \u201cFord thought they could wait until Friday morning and then just make a better offer. They stopped being interested in reaching a fair deal now and only became interested in gaming our system of announcing strike expansions on Friday,\u201d Fain said. \u201cThey thought they figured out the so-called rules of the game. So we changed the rules.\u201d Fain added that the Kentucky truck plant strike is sending a \u201cvery clear message\u201d to Ford -- as well as GM and Stellantis. The union began the strike by targeting a small number of plants from each company rather than have all 146,000 UAW members at the automakers go on strike at the same time. Last week, the union reported progress in the talks and decided not to add any more plants. This came after GM agreed to bring joint-venture electric vehicle battery factories into the national master contract, almost assuring that the plants will be unionized. Battery plants are a major point of contention in the negotiations. The UAW wants those plants to be unionized to assure jobs and top wages for workers who will be displaced by the industry\u2019s ongoing transition to electric vehicles. Galhotra said Ford is trying to figure out the complexities of pulling its joint venture battery factories into the national contract with the UAW. That would match GM and essentially ensure the plants would be union. Fain told workers that despite the escalation, they are making progress in their quest to get large wage gains, restore cost of living adjustments, get defined benefit pension plans for all workers, end different pay scale tiers around the nation and win job security assurances with promises to build new vehicles in the U.S. ",

        "title": "Social Security recipients will see a cost-of-living increase of 3.2% in 2024",
        "content": "Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% in 2024, the Social Security Administration announced Thursday morning. That adds about $50 monthly to the average retirement benefit consumers will receive beginning in January. The annual increases are called cost of living adjustments, or COLAs. The agency said people on Social Security will start getting the increased payments on Dec. 29. \"Social Security and SSI benefits will increase in 2024, and this will help millions of people keep up with expenses,\" said Kilolo Kijakazi, the acting commissioner of Social Security. SSI is Supplemental Security Income. The cost of living adjustment is calculated based on an average of the inflation readings for the months of July, August and September. Specifically, it\u2019s based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI-W rose 2.6% in July, 3.4% in August and 3.6% in September, according to the latest inflation data the bureau released Thursday. \"Retirees can rest a little easier at night knowing they will soon receive an increase in their Social Security checks to help them keep up with rising prices. We know older Americans are still feeling the sting when they buy groceries and gas, making every dollar important,\" Jo Ann Jenkins, the CEO of AARP, the nonprofit organization formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, said in an emailed statement. However, another advocacy group for older Americans, the Senior Citizens League, has argued that larger increases are required, especially for older retirees. It contends that the costs of the goods and services they need are growing much faster than Social Security benefits. The group says people who retired before 2000 would need an additional $500 in benefits every month just to get back the purchasing power they had in 2000. Almost 67 million people have been receiving Social Security benefits in 2023, according to the SSA. Most of them are retirees, as almost 90% of people over age 65 were getting those benefits as of June 30. Inflation rocketed to 40-year highs last year in the wake of a combination of pandemic stimulus payments, an increase in shopping and spending, and widespread supply chain problems. That prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a rapid pace. The benchmark U.S. interest rate is the highest it has been in more than 20 years. That has slowed the economy somewhat compared to last year, but inflation remains higher than it was throughout the 2010s. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "content": "Recent strikes by Hollywood talent and United Auto Workers union members are a \u201cdrag\u201d on business travel demand, which is otherwise recovering, Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said Thursday. Delta has an outsized exposure to the automotive and entertainment industries, with a more than 70% market share at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and a nearly 20% share at Los Angeles International Airport, more than any other carrier, according to airport data. The strikes have had \u201ca not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles as well as now the UAW strike, which curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit,\u201d Hauenstein said on an earnings call on Thursday. \u201cWe are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.\u201d The United Auto Workers\u2019 targeted strikes, which began after major Detroit automakers and the union failed to reach labor deals before a September contract expiration, are entering their fourth week \u2014 and escalating. Hollywood writers earlier this week ratified a new three-year contract after nearly 150 days of work stoppage that suspended significant film and TV production. But Hollywood actors, represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, are still on strike. And late Wednesday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production studios like Disney, Universal, Netflix and others, said talks have been been suspended with the two sides far apart on a deal. Delta\u2019s Hauenstein noted that demand from technology and financial services customers posted double-digit growth in the third quarter, contributing to an overall rebound for business travel. A company survey of corporate customers found that a majority expect their travel to stay the same or increase in the last three months of this year and into 2024, Hauenstein said. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is a member of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. ",

        "title": "Inflation leveled off at 3.7% in September, continuing a gradual consumer price slowdown",
        "content": "Inflation leveled off to 3.7% in September compared to a year ago, extending a gradual slowdown in consumer prices, even as it slowed to 0.4% from 0.6% in August. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest round of price data Thursday morning. Experts had expected it to show that overall prices for consumers rose 3.6% from a year ago, and by 0.2% compared to August. Meanwhile, core inflation \u2014 a measurement of cost increases that excludes energy and food prices because of their volatility \u2014 is up 4.1% from September last year, in line with expectations. That means prices rose less in September than they did in August, when the cost of gasoline had spiked 10% from July. The government said the cost of shelter rose 7.2% from a year ago. That was the largest reason for the increase, and it reflects continued growth in home prices, which by some measurements are at all-time highs. Used car and truck prices continued to decline from a year ago. Food prices grew 3.7%, matching the overall inflation reading, with food from restaurants and \"away from home\" up 6%. Energy prices slipped 0.5% and natural gas and oil prices also fell. The report might be especially significant for the trajectory of the economy. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply from March 2022 through this summer as it tried to get inflation under control. Inflation had hit 40-year highs in mid-2022, peaking at 9.1% annually, and it has generally slowed since then. That doesn't mean prices are lower than they were. Instead, they\u2019re rising at a slower rate. Still, those slower increases have been a relief to some consumers, and wages have been rising faster than inflation recently, which makes it easier for people to afford goods and services. \"Inflation is easing; it's edging lower. However, food and energy prices remain elevated, and the average American lives in an environment in which food and energy are basics for their budget. And that budget is climbing higher,\" said Quincy Krosby, the chief global strategist for LPL Financial. The Fed left rates unchanged in September, saying there had been progress in its fight against inflation. It's in wait-and-see mode now. But after 12 consecutive monthly declines, inflation sped up again in July and August. The increases were small, and there were reasons experts weren't especially concerned about them \u2014 for example, gas prices spiked 10% in August. Thursday's report doesn't make it clear what will happen next. There are signs inflation is easing, but it's not happening very fast, and inflation is still well above the Fed's stated goal of 2% per year. \u201cCore year-over-year [inflation] remains high, and the question is how much patience does the Fed have to finish the job,\u201d Krosby said. Americans have generally remained willing to spend money because the job market looks healthy and pay for workers has been rising. But the combination of steady inflation and higher interest rates could erode that. Krosby points out that other factors like gas prices and the resumption of student loan payments could also drag down spending. The Fed will meet two more times this year. Its main rate is now in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest since 2000. Investors think there\u2019s about a 90% chance the Fed will leave interest rates alone at its next meeting, which ends Nov. 1. However, what happens at the December meeting is far less clear, with a roughly 60% chance of no change and a 40% chance of a rate hike, according to CME Group. That\u2019s based on its analysis of options prices. Like interest rates, mortgage rates are already at 23-year highs, which has made it much harder for people to afford homes. More rate hikes would push mortgage rates even higher. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Inflation in America: Where are prices rising and falling?",
        "content": "After having rocked U.S. consumers at levels not experienced in more than 40 years, inflation has moderated in 2023. In September, consumer prices were 3.7% higher than the year before, close to the Federal Reserve's target 2% target NBC News is tracking inflation levels across a variety of consumer metrics. The chart below, which shows how prices each month compare to the same time a year earlier, will be updated monthly. For most of 2021 and 2022, broad swaths of the economy dealt with supply chain disruptions that affected the availability of wine and video game consoles to cars and eggs. For cars and consumer electronics, even if manufacturers wanted to build more items, they didn't have enough computer chips or raw materials to do so for more than a year. Car prices finally began falling in early 2023. Many industries, including oil refining, cars and airlines, cut staff and production in 2020 at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving them understaffed when demand for travel roared back. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent oil embargoes by the U.S. and the European Union have also further strained the global energy supply, isolating one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers and driving prices higher as countries scramble for replacements. And rising natural gas prices have led to spikes in the cost of electricity, sending energy bills soaring in some cities. The federal government has taken steps to combat rising prices. President Joe Biden authorized several withdrawals from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and more than 20 states, including New York, Connecticut and Georgia, either paused their local gas taxes or introduced legislation to do so. The Federal Reserve has also raised interest rates several times in the past year to cool demand by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money.

        "title": "UAW says it's expanding strike to include major Ford truck plant in Kentucky",
        "content": "DETROIT \u2014 The United Auto Workers union significantly escalated its strikes against Detroit Three automakers Wednesday by going on strike against a major Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky. In a surprise move, the 8,700 members left their jobs at about 6:30 p.m. at the plant, which makes profitable heavy-duty F-Series pickups and large SUVs. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement that the union has waited long enough \u201cbut Ford hasn\u2019t gotten the message\u201d to bargain for a fair contract. Ford called the strike expansion \u201cgrossly irresponsible\u201d but said it wasn\u2019t surprising given the UAW leadership\u2019s statements that it wanted to keep Detroit automakers hobbled with \u201cindustrial chaos.\u201d The UAW began striking against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis on Sept. 15, with one assembly plant from each company. The next week, the union expanded the strike to 38 GM and Stellantis parts warehouses. Assembly plants from Ford and GM were added the week after that. All told, about 25,000 workers have walked off their jobs at the three automakers. Thus far, the union has decided to target a small number of plants from each company rather than have all 146,000 UAW members at the automakers go on strike at the same time. Last week, the union reported progress in the talks and decided not to add any more plants. This came after GM agreed to bring joint-venture electric vehicle battery factories into the national master contract, almost assuring that the plants will be unionized. Battery plants are a major point of contention in the negotiations. The UAW wants those plants to be unionized to assure jobs and top wages for workers who will be displaced by the industry\u2019s ongoing transition to electric vehicles. Since the start of the strike, the three Detroit automakers have laid off roughly 4,800 workers at factories that are not among the plants that have been hit by the UAW strikes. The companies say the strikes have forced them to impose those layoffs. They note that the job cuts have occurred mainly at factories that make parts for assembly plants that were closed by strikes. In one case, layoffs have been imposed at a factory that uses supplies from a parts factory on strike. The UAW rejects that argument. It contends that the layoffs are unjustified and were imposed as part of the companies\u2019 pressure campaign to persuade UAW members to accept less favorable terms in negotiations with automakers. The factories that have been affected by layoffs are in six states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Kansas, Indiana and New York. Sam Fiorani, an analyst with AutoForecast Solutions, a consulting firm, said he thinks the layoffs reflect a simple reality: The automakers are losing money because of the strikes. By slowing or idling factories that are running below their capacities because of strike-related parts shortages, Fiorani said, the companies can mitigate further losses. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to keep running at 30% or 40% of capacity when it normally runs at 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at huge numbers of workers relative to the ones actually being struck. But there is fallout.\u201d In a statement, Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said: \u201cWhile we are doing what we can to avoid layoffs, we have no choice but to reduce production of parts that would be destined for a plant that is on strike.\u201d Fain countered in a statement that the automakers were using layoffs to pressure the union into settling the strike. With billions in profits, Fain argued, the companies don\u2019t have to lay off a single employee. Striking workers are receiving $500 a week from the union\u2019s strike pay fund. By contrast, anyone who is laid off would qualify for state unemployment aid, which, depending on a variety of circumstances, could be less or more than $500 a week. \u201cTheir plan won\u2019t work,\u201d Fain said. \u201cThe UAW will make sure any worker laid off in the Big Three\u2019s latest attack will not go without an income.\u201d Fiorani said that if the strike widens, more workers will likely be laid off at non-striking plants. Once metal stamping factories that supply multiple assembly plants have produced enough parts for non-striking facilities, the companies would likely shut them down. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve filled up the stocks for the other plants you supply,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to lay off the workers and wait out the strike.\u201d Separate companies that manufacture parts for the automakers are likely to have laid off workers but might not report them publicly, said Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group in Lansing, Michigan. A survey of parts supply companies by a trade association called MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers found that 30% of members have laid off workers and that more than 60% expect to start layoffs in mid-October. Fiorani said that while larger parts suppliers can likely withstand the strike, smaller companies that make parts for the bigger companies might not have enough cash or the ability to borrow to outlast the job actions. Some, he said, may have a couple dozen workers \u201cand don\u2019t have billions in value to use as collateral in loans,\u201d he said. ",

        "title": "Caroline Ellison, star witness in Bankman-Fried trial, recounts living in 'a constant state of dread'",
        "content": "Caroline Ellison, who led the digital currency hedge fund connected with Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, is continuing her testimony in his criminal trial Wednesday. Ellison, who is also Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, is considered the star witness in the prosecution's case. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering in connection with his oversight of the now-defunct FTX and Alameda Research, both of which filed for bankruptcy last year. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. His defense attorneys began cross-examining Ellison late Wednesday afternoon and will continue Thursday. In less than a year, Bankman-Fried, 31, has gone from a crypto titan and a rising global player with a net worth estimated at $16 billion to a defendant whose closest associates are testifying against him in a case that could put him in prison for decades. Ellison is at the center of that. On Tuesday, she testified that Bankman-Fried told her to steal some $10 billion from FTX's customers and use it to repay firms that had lent money to Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm she was leading. \"Sam directed me to commit these crimes,\" Ellison said in court Tuesday after she told prosecutors that she, Bankman-Fried and others had committed fraud. She also said that Bankman-Fried set up the system that let her move the money. Ellison started at Alameda as a trader in 2018. She testified that after the hedge fund suffered large losses that year, Bankman-Fried made getting more money a top priority. To that end, he told Alameda employees to get loans on any terms they could. That was risky, because lenders could call those loans in at any time. Ellison said there were enough of them to bankrupt Alameda if the loans all became due and payable immediately. She said Bankman-Fried also tried to strengthen the firms by creating the digital token FTT. She said Alameda owned 60-70% of the supply of the coin, which cost essentially nothing to make. When its market price rose from an initial 10 cents to $50 over time, Alameda gained billions on paper. Ellison is testifying under a deal with the government after she pleaded guilty to a series of fraud charges and conspiracy to commit money laundering. FTX co-founder Gary Wang also testified against Bankman-Fried this week after pleading guilty to fraud charges. Both are hoping to get their eventual sentences reduced. Former FTX technology head Nishad Singh also pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the implosion of FTX and Alameda. In 2021, Ellison became Alameda's co-CEO, and later became sole CEO. However, prosecutors say Bankman-Fried was calling the shots. Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers have argued that Ellison was fully responsible and that she mismanaged the company, including by failing to make protective hedge trades that could have reduced the risk of big losses. Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried told her to put the growing value of the FTT tokens on Alameda's balance sheet so it could borrow money. She said she felt that was misleading, but that he persuaded her to proceed. Alameda later did the same with other coins that gained a great deal of value because of Bankman-Fried's involvement with them. When her testimony continued Wednesday, Ellison told prosecutors about events in June 2022, when several crypto firms and exchanges failed and investors collectively pulled about $1 trillion out of the market. Some of Alameda's lenders were asking for their loans to be repaid, as she feared they would. Ellison testified that she knew the only way to repay them was to take money from FTX customers. She said Bankman-Fried told her to do just that, and that he knew the money was secretly being taken from those customers. Ellison told the court that when a major lender \u2014 financial services firm Genesis \u2014 asked to see an updated Alameda balance sheet, she, Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh brainstormed ways to make the company\u2019s financial position look stronger so that Genesis wouldn't ask for more money back. They prepared a variety of different balance sheets to show Genesis, she said, testifying that she \"was in a constant state of dread\" at this time. Bankman-Fried chose a balance sheet that hid the fact that Alameda was taking some $10 billion from FTX's users.  By October, she said, Alameda had taken $14 billion to $15 billion from FTX's users, and Bankman-Fried was trying to raise money to fill that hole. Things fell apart in early November, after one of the doctored balance sheets was leaked to CoinDesk. Even though the document made Alameda's situation look better than it really was, it worried investors, who saw that much of the firm's balance sheet was made up of the FTT token. The rival exchange Binance soon announced it would dump its FTT holdings, which caused the price to crash and made Alameda's situation much worse. The firm managed to briefly prop it up with more customer assets, but that soon failed. Ellison told the court that Bankman-Fried warned her and others to be wary about how they communicate with one another and to set their private chats to auto-delete, but she turned off that feature a few days after the news broke. The government showed the jury messages in which she told Bankman-Fried that she was relieved. \"I think I just had an increasing dread of this day that was weighing on me for a long time and now that it's actually happening it just feels great to get it over with one way or another,\" she wrote. Ellison cried after the messages were shared in court. There was a brief reprieve when Binance agreed to buy FTX, but the deal fell apart. FTX and Alameda sought bankruptcy protection two days after that. Criminal charges were filed against Bankman-Fried, Ellison, Wang and Singh a few weeks later. Bankman-Fried faces a separate trial in March over additional charges, including accusations of bribing foreign officials. Ellison testified that Alameda paid a large bribe to Chinese officials to get them to unfreeze about $1 billion on Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges. Bankman-Fried has also pleaded not guilty to those charges. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "U.S. gas prices are likely to keep falling despite the Israel-Hamas war, analysts say",
        "content": "Prices at the pump remain on track to keep falling in the United States despite the Israel-Hamas war, according to energy industry analysts. After Hamas\u2019 surprise attack over the weekend, global crude oil jumped to more than $87 a barrel by Monday, from below $83 late last week \u2014 roughly a 5% increase. Prices have since retreated, clocking in at $83.62 Wednesday morning. But Israel and its immediate neighbors aren\u2019t major energy producers, so as long as the conflict doesn\u2019t expand geographically, seasonal trends should continue much as they have for the last few weeks, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cOn balance, we\u2019re looking at gasoline prices dropping in all 50 states,\u201d he said. A gallon of regular gas cost $3.66 on average in the U.S. as of Wednesday, according to AAA, down from $3.83 a month ago. Prices at gas stations are falling as Americans wrap up their summer travel and as refineries switch to their winter fuel blend, which is cheaper and easier to produce. In a note Monday, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan described the initial spike in crude oil prices as a temporary \u201cknee-jerk reaction,\u201d adding that he sees a \u201cvery very low risk\u201d of U.S. gas prices rising. However, Kloza warned, \u201cIf you wake up and the theater of war has been expanded to Iran, that changes the calculus.\u201d Tehran has long funded the military wing of Hamas, and U.S. officials are currently investigating whether Hamas fighters received any advance training from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The winter fuel mix is rolling out at a pace that should allow gas prices to continue falling through the next few weeks, Kloza said, estimating that prices at the pump could drop by as much as 2 cents a gallon each day. That would leave a gallon of regular costing an average $3.25 by Halloween. The conflict has already affected the operations of producers of other types of energy, including natural gas. Israeli officials this week ordered the shutdown of the Tamar offshore gas platform, a major Chevron-operated facility off the coast of Gaza. But analysts so far don\u2019t foresee broader disruptions in global supplies, and natural gas prices have been dropping as well. Most U.S. households are set to spend less to heat their homes this winter, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday in its latest seasonal forecast, in part because this winter is expected to be warmer than last. The EIA projected the biggest price drops in natural gas costs \u2014 with consumer bills for the fuel set to shrink by 21% on average. Still, crude oil prices on international commodities markets have been volatile lately as traders weighed the violence in the Middle East. That\u2019s partly due to potential uncertainty around shipping routes through which oil produced elsewhere in the region gets to markets around the world. \u201cA wider conflict including Iran may impact the oil trade through the Strait of Hormuz, a channel Iran has previously threatened to shut,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts wrote on Tuesday. Five of the top 10 largest oil producers \u2014 Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 use that waterway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, to move about a fifth of the world\u2019s crude oil supply, according EIA data. But even if Iran were to choke off exports through the strait, the U.S. would have the capacity to lean on its own domestic production, analysts said. U.S. crude oil exports reached a record high in the first half of 2023, extending America\u2019s lead as the largest oil producer in the world, a title it claimed in 2018. \u201cOil hates turmoil,\u201d De Haan said in his note, \u201cbut if the violence does not spill over into other areas, it should not worsen.\u201d Brian Cheung is a business and data reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance has chosen veteran health care executive Tim Wentworth as the company\u2019s new chief executive. Wentworth is the former CEO of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits management company, Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna in 2018. He stayed on and served as chief of Cigna\u2019s health services, before retiring at the of 2021. \u201cWhat made me decide to come back was a chance to lead this iconic brand and company at a time when it\u2019s not in a steady state,\u201d Wentworth told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive platform... they touch almost 10 million people a day.\u201d Wentworth will start on Oct. 23, almost two months after Roz Brewer stepped down as CEO, at a time when the company is facing a number of challenges in trying to transition to becoming a provider of health services beyond the pharmacy counter. Under Brewer\u2019s tenure, Walgreens took a major stake in primary care provider VillageMD, acquired specialty pharmacy provider Shields Health, as well as homecare provider CareCentrix. Trying to integrate and scale the businesses has pressured Walgreens\u2019 earnings. The transition has come at a time when pharmacy revenue has been pressured by falling demand for Covid vaccines and over-the-counter tests. In June, the company\u2019s third-quarter profits missed Wall Street estimates for the first time in three years. Walgreens\u2019 board has said they were intent on hiring an executive with deep health experience who could rein in all of the new services. \u201cI came from one of the great efficiency companies at Express Scripts \u2014 I mean, we were built to drive out waste from health care and and we looked at everything through that lens. And that has to do by starting with our own cost structure, and there\u2019s no question inside this company that\u2019s every bit as important,\u201d said Wentworth. Walgreens\u2019 executive chairman Stefano Pessina said Wentworth \u201cis an accomplished and respected leader with profound expertise in the payer and pharmacy space as well as supply chain, IT and Human Resources. We are confident he is the right person to lead WBA\u2019s next phase of growth into a customer-centric health care company.\u201d The company\u2019s core pharmacy business is also facing challenges. This week, pharmacists in several cities have walked off the job to protest understaffing at pharmacies which the non-union workers say endangers patients.  Wentworth says during Covid the drugstore chains pivoted quickly to become major providers of vaccines and supported patients with information. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a business that\u2019s having to respond that quickly to something that is that unusual. You don\u2019t get it all right. And I have no doubt that the leadership at Walgreens is taking a look and listening to their folks,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a leader, I can tell you, there\u2019s nothing that motivates me more than ensuring every employee feels like they\u2019re supported in that mission.\u201d Walgreens is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

She said Bankman-Fried set up the system that let her move the money. She also said Bankman-Fried directed her to send balance sheets to lenders that made Alameda's losses look less risky. Her testimony follows that of FTX co-founder Gary Wang, also a witness for the prosecution. Both were charged with a series of financial crimes in December, and Ellison pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, which could put him in prison for the rest of his life.

Alameda later did the same with other coins. She also testified that Alameda made $5 billion in personal loans to company insiders. Some of those loans were risky because they could be called in at any time, and she said there were enough of them to bankrupt Alameda if they all became due and payable immediately. Her testimony continued Wednesday, with Ellison telling prosecutors about events in June 2022, when the crypto markets were in turmoil. Some of Alameda's lenders were asking for their loans to be repaid, and Ellison testified that she knew the only way to repay them was to take money from FTX customers. She said Bankman-Fried told her to do just that, knowing the money was secretly being taken from those customers.

Bankman-Fried chose one that hid the fact that Alameda was taking some $10 billion from FTX's users.  While Ellison was officially in charge of Alameda, prosecutors say Bankman-Fried was calling the shots and was responsible for those schemes. Bankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that Ellison was fully responsible and that she mismanaged the company. For a short time, FTX was one of the biggest names during a boom in the digital currency industry. It struck sponsorship deals with sports teams and ran a star-studded Super Bowl commercial. Bankman-Fried's personal wealth was estimated in the tens of billions, primarily because of his ownership stake in the company. Alameda and FTX quickly collapsed in November 2022 after CoinDesk reported on the tight links between the two firms and the liabilities Alameda had. One of FTX's biggest rivals announced that it would sell its holdings of the digital token that made up much of Alameda's balance sheet, which caused its value to crater. Then, nervous customers started pulling their money from the FTX exchange. FTX could not give those customers their money back, in part because of the money it had lent to Alameda. It had to halt withdrawals, and within days, both companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Ellison, like Wang before her, is cooperating with the government in exchange for a reduction in her sentence. Without such a deal, both faced sentences that could have kept them in prison for the rest of their lives. Nishad Singh also pleaded guilty to a series of criminal charges. Ellison and Wang both had close personal relationships with Bankman-Fried, or SBF, who appeared distressed at times by Wang's testimony against him. Meanwhile, Ellison was one of the first people Bankman-Fried recruited to work with him, in 2017. Before that, they were co-workers at a trading firm in New York. Bankman-Fried was sent to jail in August in advance of the trial after the government accused him of witness tampering. He had purportedly leaked diary entries from Ellison to The New York Times.

        "title": "FTC announces proposed rule to ban 'junk fees'",
        "content": "The Federal Trade Commission rolled out a proposed rule Wednesday that would ban what it calls hidden and bogus fees that can cost consumers an extra $80 billion every year, officials said. \u201cThis is real money. It really adds up for people,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in an interview that aired Wednesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show. The proposed rule would make it clearer when extra fees are being charged, like at hotels and at live-ticket events, the agency says. It would bar businesses from using hidden fees, or charges that the FTC calls \u201cbogus fees\u201d and which are misrepresentations, the commission said in a statement. It would also prohibit businesses from advertising prices that leave out mandatory fees, a practice that causes consumers to expect to pay one price, only to see the actual cost soar, according to the FTC. It wouldn\u2019t stop a company selling tickets to a concert from adding fees, and it wouldn\u2019t limit what they can charge. \u201cWhat the rule says is that if there\u2019s going to be a fee, a mandatory fee, it needs to be part of the total price that consumers see up front,\u201d a senior administration official said in a briefing. Hidden fees are an issue that Robert Kraus, a frequent traveler who organizes conventions, knows all too well \u2014 things like getting charged $3 for a glass of water he didn\u2019t ask for, and the price of which is not on the menu, and other extra fees, like resort fees. \u201cSometimes they call it a convenience fee,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s convenient for me and you to pay 20, 30, 40 dollars a night so that they can make more money and not be honest and upfront.\u201d President Joe Biden at his State of the Union address in February mentioned junk fees, which he described as \"those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more.\" \"They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip,\" Biden said. His administration has proposed a bill that would ban surprise hotel resort fees, he said. It was introduced in the Senate in March. In June, Biden said ticket sales giants Ticketmaster and Live Nation have pledged to provide consumers with full pricing upfront. The proposed FTC rule will next be published in the Federal Register, and then people can comment for 60 days. The FTC could force violators to provide refunds, and it could seek monetary penalties against companies. Other agencies are also taking action, officials said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is issuing guidance to enforce rules to prevent banks from charging fees for basic services, like balance requests or other information, it said. The bureau also plans later this month to propose a rule that it says would make it easier to shop around with banks and to switch accounts, for example to find a better interest rate, officials said.

        "title": "Utah lawsuit accuses TikTok of knowingly getting children hooked on harmful content",
        "content": "Utah sued TikTok on Tuesday, saying it knowingly uses technology to keep children engaged with material that is often harmful. \"The harms to children need to stop,\" Gov. Spencer Cox said as he announced the suit at a news conference. The consumer protection lawsuit, filed in Salt Lake City state court, says TikTok uses technology that aims to keep children on the app despite known mental health harms that correlate to time spent engaging with social media. Utah has accused the app, based in Culver City, California, of using algorithms to target children with content that is sometimes violent and distressing through its \"recommendation engine\" to keep them looking at the app. The company rejects Utah's allegations. \"TikTok has industry-leading safeguards for young people, including an automatic 60-minute time limit for users under 18 and parental controls for teen accounts,\" a spokesperson for the app said. \"We will continue to work to keep our community safe by tackling industry-wide challenges.\" In March, amid lawmakers' efforts to ban it, company CEO Shou Zi Chew told Congress that TikTok is safe and secure for teenagers. At the time, it reached 150 million active U.S. users \u2014 nearly half the population. Its ad revenue last year was nearly $10 billion, according to Utah's suit. At Tuesday's news conference, state Attorney General Sean Reyes likened TikTok to \"a slot machine that hooks kids' attention and does not let them go.\" Among the technology it deploys is \"infinite scroll,\" which provides fresh videos targeted at a particular user, the suit claims. Another tool is \"filter bubbles\" that feed a user more extreme reels of the types of videos that pique their interest, it alleges. \"TikTok directly profited from addicting children to the app and continued to capitalize on the addictive nature of the app despite knowing the harm that addiction would cause Utah\u2019s children,\" the suit says. Utah has the highest percentage of children per capita in the country, more than 1 in 4 people, the attorney general's office said. Nearly 80% of the state's K-12 students spend two or more hours every day on screens, not counting learning engagement at school or for homework, it said in the suit. In the lawsuit, Utah also alleges that claims TikTok fails to verify users' ages, does not remove all child abuse sexual material or clips dealing with self-harm and eating disorders, fails to adequately address negative mental health effects associated with teens' use of social media, does not adequately screen out child predators, fails to rein in dangerous video challenges involving asphyxiation and bone-breaking and lies to the public about its commitment to protect children and about its ties to China, where the app originated in 2017. \"TikTok has lied to parents to create a false sense of security,\" Reyes said. Some of the company's actions or lack of action amount to violations of the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act, the suit claims. It seeks corrective action and damages \"well in excess of $300,000,\" according to the court filing. Other states, including Arkansas and Indiana, have also sued TikTok with similar allegations. Montana was the first state to ban it; creators and the app have challenged the move. Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.  ",

        "title": "Supreme Court declines to hear case challenging FDA authority to reject flavored e-cigarettes",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear arguments in a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authority to reject approvals of flavored electronic cigarettes.  The case is one of several challenges to the FDA\u2019s regulation of the vaping industry, which has hooked members of a new generation on nicotine, and ballooned into an $8.2 billion market in less than a decade.  The 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in December ruled that the FDA has the power to deny applications for flavored e-cigarette products because of its mandate to protect public health by discouraging younger people from smoking. The lower court ruling rebuffed an appeal by Avail Vapor, a vape retailer, which argues that the FDA unfairly denied its product applications based on requirements the agency \u201csecretly\u201d changed without notifying companies. Avail\u2019s attorney, Eric Heyer, told CNBC on Tuesday that the company is \u201cdisappointed that the Supreme Court declined to review the flawed process by which FDA issued its marketing denial orders to Avail without adequate prior notice of the specific longitudinal comparative efficacy study requirements the agency ultimately imposed.\u201d The FDA issues marketing denial orders to reject product applications. A spokesperson for the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. In 2016, the FDA determined that e-cigarettes were subject to its regulation, like traditional tobacco products. E-cigarettes are handheld devices used to inhale a vapor, which usually contains nicotine, flavoring and other chemicals.  The agency gave companies until September 2020 to submit applications for approval of each of their vape products, even if they were already on the market.  The FDA in March said nearly seven million applications were submitted by that deadline, but the agency has rejected more than 1 million of them. The case is related to the FDA\u2019s 2021 decision to reject all of Avail Vapor\u2019s applications for its fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA said Avail did not present long-term studies demonstrating that its sweet-flavored vapes were more effective at helping adult smokers quit than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes. The agency said those studies are necessary to demonstrate that the benefits of Avail\u2019s products to adults outweigh their risks to youth. Children, teens and young adults are more attracted to e-cigarettes that mimic the taste of sweet treats, according to the FDA. Avail\u2019s applications included four studies that surveyed patients on the safety and usability of a few of the company\u2019s products and e-cigarettes overall, but that research did not make any comparisons to tobacco-flavored vapes. The company also outlined its marketing measures, including age verification for online sales, designed to prevent underage use of its flavored e-cigarettes.  Avail in its appeal to the 4th Circuit had argued that the FDA had not said it would need to see long-term studies comparing the company\u2019s fruit and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes with tobacco-flavored vapes.  \u201cThe FDA says Avail and other retailers should have known what they were going to be looking for. Well, virtually nobody in the industry knew,\u201d Heyer told CNBC. \u201cThe lack of those comparative efficacy studies was one of the main reasons why the FDA denied these applications,\u201d he added. \u201cThe FDA had five years to communicate this to applicants and they never did. Not a single word.\u201d Avail also argued that the FDA was obligated to consider the marketing plan included in its applications. But 4th Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in December that Avail \u201cencourages us to neglect the forest for the trees\u201d by focusing on procedural objections rather than the FDA\u2019s mandate to \u201censure that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products.\u201d Wilkinson said the FDA did not reject the applications due to their lack of specific long-term studies. He said the agency followed its mandate by requiring strong, product-specific evidence to evaluate the benefit of new e-cigarette products to adults, which Avail did not provide. Avail exited the retail business after selling all of its 100 brick-and-mortar stores in October 2021, a month after the FDA rejected its applications. Avail is not the only company to challenge application rejections from the FDA. Last year, Juul Labs lost in its appeal of the FDA\u2019s ban on its vaping products. The e-cigarette giant, which slashed nearly a third of its workforce in a bid to avoid bankruptcy, said the FDA conducted an incorrect and incomplete assessment of its data. Upon review of the appeal and a temporary reprieve that allowed some of Juul\u2019s products to come back to market, the agency determined Juul\u2019s products still pose a risk to public health. However, in some cases, the FDA has rescinded, or partially rescinded, rejections following the appeal process. To date, the FDA has authorized 23 tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices. Efforts to restrict e-cigarette flavors favored by teens may have fallen flat as new brands hit the market. E-cigarette unit sales rose nearly 47% between January 2020 and December 2022. Many popular brands of disposable e-cigarettes on the market are not FDA-approved and are illegal. ",

        "title": "Clorox warns cyberattack and product shortages will drag sales downward",
        "content": "If you've noticed an empty store shelf where Clorox bleach, Glad trash bags or Burt's Bees skin products should be, you're not alone. Clorox, the consumer products giant that makes those and many other items, is still picking up the pieces after a devastating cyberattack two months ago. The company said in late September that for weeks, it had been unable to automatically process orders for its vendors, including large retail stores like Walmart and Target. That slowed down sales and caused outages and shortages. Allan Liska, a cybersecurity researcher at Recorded Future, speculated about the damage caused to Clorox's manufacturing operation after the cyberattack: \"When [Clorox] couldn't take in the orders, even though the lines themselves could run, [Clorox] couldn't tell them what to produce or where to send it.\" Liska isn't working on the Clorox case, but said he is familiar with it. Last week, Clorox started to explain how the ransomware attack has hurt its business. The company said Wednesday it will likely lose money in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024, which ended Sept. 30, as a result of the breach and the necessary repairs to its systems. Clorox had $1.74 billion in revenue in the first quarter of last year, and in early August, shortly before it disclosed the cyberattack, the company said it expected sales to grow in the mid single digits in the first quarter. If sales had grown 5%, that would have resulted in $1.83 billion in revenue based on last year's totals. Instead, the company said last week that sales will fall 23% to 28% from a year ago. That would come out to between $1.25 billion and $1.34 billion in revenue instead. That might translate to a revenue drop of $500 million or more compared to what Clorox anticipated before it discovered the breach. Bloomberg reported last week that officials believe Clorox was hacked by the same group that went after casino operators MGM and Caesars Entertainment in September. MGM, Caesars and Clorox all had to tell the public about those hacks because of new rules that securities regulators adopted in July. Essentially, companies have to disclose any major data breach within four days. And some of the largest hacks of the recent past, like those that affected JBS USA Holdings and Colonial Pipeline, affected companies that don't have to follow similar rules. But even if Clorox did not have to announce a major data breach, consumers would notice when Tilex, Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, Kingsford charcoal or Scoop Away cat litter were in short supply. They just might not know the reason for it. Clorox, for its part, says that it's still dealing with the effects of the breach and continuing to get its business back on track. \"All our manufacturing sites are operational, and we are ramping up production and working to restock trade inventories,\" Clorox told NBC News in an emailed statement. The company says it will benefit as retailers start to restock, but even that won't happen until its fiscal second quarter, in early 2024. Until that's complete, shoppers are likely to have to deal with continued shortages of some of Clorox's products. Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "'Kill us or send us home': Workers at Amazon in Saudi Arabia say recruiters exploited them",
        "content": "This story was reported in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and The Guardian. Momtaj Mansur flew to Saudi Arabia in September 2021, excited to work at one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, Amazon. He was promised a well-paying job and planned to use the money to help his family back in Nepal. Less than a year later, he said he was living in a crowded room with seven other men, jammed with bunk beds infested with bed bugs. The water was often salty and undrinkable. His hopes were shattered, and he was deep in debt. Momtaj Mansur is one of more than 50 current and former workers who said they were misled and exploited by firms that supply labor to Amazon in Saudi Arabia and by their network of recruiting agencies in Nepal. All the workers said they had to pay fees to recruiters to get hired, ranging from the equivalent of $830 to $2,040, even though fees that large are illegal, according to the Nepali government. To pay those fees, many workers needed to take out loans at high interest rates. They also all said they were duped by recruiters into working for labor supply companies rather than directly for Amazon. The workers were interviewed as part of an international reporting collaboration with NBC News, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and The Guardian. Click here to read the ICIJ's version of this story. About a dozen workers like Mansur agreed to speak on the record. Others, fearful that speaking out would hurt their chances for other employment, were interviewed with the agreement that their names would not be published. To substantiate their accounts, the journalists reviewed photographs, emails, receipts, messages and other documentation from their time working at Amazon. After being presented with the findings, Amazon told NBC News it had conducted its own investigation and found labor violations. The company promised measures to fix the problems, including compensating workers who paid recruiting fees to the companies supplying labor. \u201cWe are deeply concerned that some of our contract workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2026 were not treated with the standards we set forth, and the dignity and respect they deserve,\u201d John Felton, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a written statement. \u201cWe appreciate their willingness to come forward and report their experience,\u201d Felton wrote. \u201cOur supply chain audit process and our own investigation surfaced violations of our standards.\u201d In particular, the company cited recruiting fees and squalid housing among the violations it found, but declined to offer more details or discuss other labor violations. A key player for Amazon is a labor supply company that gets workers from other countries \u2014 the Saudi-based Abdullah Fahad Al-Mutairi Co. Amazon is among several large corporations that has contracted Al-Mutairi, which has billed itself as \u201ca leading provider of human resource solutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d Forty-nine of the 54 workers interviewed were hired through Al-Mutairi. Amazon said it considered \u201csuspending\u201d the company \u201cwhen these allegations came to light.\u201d Instead, it decided to work with Al-Mutairi to make \u201csignificant changes to their operations.\u201d Al-Mutairi did not respond to repeated requests for comment. To get workers, Al-Mutairi has worked with recruiting companies in Nepal and elsewhere to attract laborers.  Momtaj Mansur in Nepal was one of them. When he came to Saudi Arabia, he worked at Amazon\u2019s vast two-story warehouse called RUH 6, in the capital city, Riyadh. He spent his nights as a \u201cpicker,\u201d hustling up and down aisles grabbing iPhones, packs of Red Bull and other items ordered by Amazon\u2019s customers across the Arabian Peninsula. He recalled that Amazon managers berated him for being slow, even as he exceeded company targets to pick 70 to 80 items an hour from shelves and boxes. Then things got worse. In May 2022, Mansur said, he was among a group of workers who were let go without warning or explanation \u2014 without work, wages or enough food. Mansur said he pleaded with Al-Mutairi: If there was no more work at Amazon, let them return to Nepal. \u201cI told them: Either kill us or send us home, but don\u2019t give us so much pain.\u201d  He said the labor supply firm told him that the only way he could return home was to pay the company an exit fee of more than $1,300 as a penalty for leaving before the end of his two-year contract. It was an enormous sum for his family, which subsisted on about $300 a month, along with rice, wheat and peas grown on a fifth of an acre shared with relatives.  The labor firm was \u201cheartless,\u201d Mansur said. \u201cHow could I pay that amount? By selling our house or my kidney?\u201d In the end, his family sunk itself even deeper in debt by taking out a loan \u2014 at 36% interest \u2014 to pay the exit fee. Twenty workers interviewed for this story said labor supply firms told workers they could not go home to Nepal unless they paid exit fees that often equaled several months\u2019 wages.  Mansur is back home in Nepal, cultivating crops on his family\u2019s small plot of land. But he\u2019s still angry at the firms he blames for his agony in the Arabian Peninsula. He asks himself: \u201cWhat sin did I commit to end up in Saudi?\u201d Amazon told NBC News that Mansur had a good work record, and would be welcome to return to employment with the company. The interviews with workers describe practices that are considered by experts to be markers for potential labor trafficking under U.S. law and U.N. standards. These include subjecting workers to abusive working and living conditions; restricting their movement; and making false statements about the identity of the employer. U.N. standards say any recruitment fees should be paid by the employer, not the worker.  Several workers said they complained to Amazon warehouse managers or human resources officials about low or missing wages, poor housing conditions and the strains of warehouse work. Amazon said it is working to improve oversight of its labor suppliers and prevent future violations of its standards. \u201cWe\u2019re implementing stronger controls for all our vendors to ensure similar incidents do not occur and to raise overall standards for workers in the region, including providing enhanced trainings for our third-party vendors on labor rights standards with a specific focus on recruitment, wages and deception,\u201d said Felton in his written statement to NBC News.  \u201cAmazon does not tolerate violations of our long-established supply chain standards or global human rights principles, and we take any allegation of violation extremely seriously,\u201d Felton stated. Read the full Amazon response here. Amazon entered the Saudi Arabian market in 2017, when it purchased the Middle Eastern online retail giant Souq.com, which had started in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. It rebranded Souq under the Amazon name and boosted its labor force by bringing in workers from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal. In 2023, Amazon reported employing nearly 1,500 permanent and seasonal workers in Saudi Arabia. As one of Asia\u2019s poorest countries, Nepal has long been a major source of foreign workers employed overseas by companies large and small. These workers send money to families back home. The World Bank reported that in 2022, overseas remittances back home accounted for 23 percent of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product. Many Nepali workers have heard horror stories from family and friends facing bad working and living conditions overseas. In a survey published in 2017 in the prestigious British medical journal BMJ, most Nepali men who have worked outside the country indicated that they had \u201cexperienced exploitation at all stages of the migration process.\u201d Half reported being targets of deceptive recruiting practices.  Like many Nepali workers, Mansur knew it is better to seek direct employment rather than working for a labor supply company.  When an agent with Rove International, a recruiting firm based in Kathmandu, offered him work at Amazon, Mansur did research. He decided a big American corporation like Amazon might differ from other companies that had abused fellow Nepali workers. Knowing that \u201cagents tell lies,\u201d he said, he asked repeatedly whether he would be an employee of Amazon or a labor supply company. The agent \u201cconfirmed to me that it was direct employment from Amazon,\u201d Mansur said, \u201cand it would change my life.\u201d He was surprised, he said, when Rove International told him that he must pay a recruiting fee of over $2,300 \u2014 especially since he knew Nepal\u2019s government caps the fees that employment firms can charge workers heading to Saudi Arabia at less than $85. Six other Nepalis confirm that Rove International charged them recruiting fees of more than $1,000 each.  Like other Nepali workers, Mansur said he paid the fee. He saw it as the cost for an opportunity to work for Amazon. Nepali workers heading to Saudi Arabia are especially vulnerable because Nepal\u2019s government has failed to enforce its policies forbidding recruiting agencies from charging high fees, according to Nepal\u2019s parliament, its Supreme Court and the U.S. State Department. Workers seeking jobs in the Middle East are also at risk because of the kafala system \u2014 a matrix of labor and immigration laws in some Gulf states that gives employers control over migrant workers\u2019 employment and immigration status. In Saudi Arabia and other countries where forms of the kafala system still exist, many foreign workers are fearful they can be punished if they leave an employer. In September 2021, Mansur traveled from his home in southern Nepal to Kathmandu and got on a Jazeera Airways flight \u2014 the first time he\u2019d ever flown and his first time outside Nepal. When he arrived in Riyadh, Mansur and other new workers from Nepal were met by Amazon officials \u2014 or so Mansur thought.  A few days into his job at an Amazon warehouse, Mansur noticed that his green ID badge differed from the blue badges worn by many other workers. The workers with blue badges were employed directly by Amazon, a co-worker explained. Those wearing green badges weren\u2019t direct Amazon employees \u2014 they were temporary workers from a labor supply provider.  He learned he was working for Al-Mutairi, not directly for Amazon. Records show Nepal\u2019s Department of Foreign Employment issued work permits in September 2021 to Mansur and 36 other Nepalis whose labor contracts were being channeled to Al-Mutairi by Rove International, the Nepali recruiting firm.  Heera Lal Shah, managing director of Rove International, said the company \u201cfollowed all legal procedures set by the government, and these workers knew where and how they were going to work.\u201d He did not respond further to questions detailing worker allegations.  Forty-eight of the 54 Nepali workers interviewed for this story said recruiters misled them about the terms of their employment, falsely promising they would work directly for Amazon. During their time in Saudi Arabia, the workers said, they were paid less than those who work directly for Amazon. \u201cWe worked more and harder, but the salary we received was much less,\u201d Mansur said. Inside Amazon\u2019s distribution centers, the pace is fierce. Pickers roam the floors, grabbing items and handing them off to packers, who stand for hours at a time. Workers said managers watch pickers through closed-circuit cameras and monitor their movements. Nepali workers report that Amazon supervisors stalked them up and down the aisles of the warehouse, yelling, \u201cYalla! Yalla!\u201d \u2014 Arabic for \u201churry.\u201d  During a normal shift, Mansur covered as many as 9 miles across warehouse floors. \u201cI would feel extremely weak. My legs would hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I returned home, I would feel like I was being pierced with needles or walking barefoot on stones. My whole body would ache.\u201d  More than 20 workers were interviewed this summer while they were still employed at Amazon warehouses in Saudi Arabia. They agreed to talk only if their names were not published because they feared retaliation for speaking out. They echoed many of the concerns that Mansur and former workers raised.  \u201cAmazon makes people work like cattle,\u201d said one current worker who said he had to pay a substantial recruiting fee and now lives in squalid housing. \u201cAmazon is a big company. I had a dream of earning money. I wanted to do something after earning money. But it didn\u2019t happen. What I expected didn\u2019t come true.\u201d  During rush periods \u2014 such as sales or holidays \u2014 supervisors monitored restroom activity, sometimes admonishing them, workers said, for taking too much time away from the warehouse floor.   \u201cThey wanted us not to take breaks when there was a high work demand,\u201d said Surendra Kumar Lama, who worked at an Amazon warehouse in Saudi Arabia from 2021 until the end of 2022, and who Amazon said was, like Mansur, a good employee who would be welcome to return to the company. \u201cThey would stand near restrooms and water stations because workers are afraid of them. Many times, I waited half an hour or an hour to go to the restroom because they were there.\u201d After a long day at Amazon\u2019s warehouses, workers come home to living accommodations provided by Al-Mutairi. Many said the housing units are cramped and squalid, with cockroaches scuttling across the floor and a briny water supply that caused rashes. Often, workers said, sleeping mattresses were infested with bed bugs and at times air conditioners \u2014 much needed for living in the hot desert country \u2014 were not functioning.  \u201cHow can eight people stay together in a small room?\u201d Mansur said. \u201cThere was no space to put personal belongings. We would keep those on our beds.\u201d In some cases, workers successfully lobbied Amazon officials to prod Al-Mutairi to address the housing problems, but improvements often did not last, according to workers. When they reported the water issue to Amazon, said one former worker, \u201cAl-Mutairi threatened us: \u2018Who complained about this? We will make him jobless!\u2019\u201d Other workers reported similar threats. Al-Mutairi was strict about requests for time off for family emergencies back home in Nepal, according to 23 current and former workers. The labor supply firm, they said, will give a worker two choices: He can pay a large fine upfront. Or he can persuade co-workers to sign a \u201cguarantor\u201d contract agreeing that they will pay a fine on his behalf if he doesn\u2019t return to Saudi Arabia to complete his labor contract. One former worker said he missed the birth of his son and his father\u2019s funeral because Al-Mutairi wouldn\u2019t let him go home. Even after he showed the firm his father\u2019s death certificate, he said, the company said he could go only if he paid a penalty of $1,600 \u2014 more than four months\u2019 salary. He couldn\u2019t afford it, and he couldn\u2019t find a co-worker willing to sign as his guarantor, he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be with my dad when he died. I couldn\u2019t hold and look at my son when he came into this world,\u201d the former worker said. During his time in Saudi Arabia, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t achieve anything, but I lost many things.\u201d One afternoon in May 2022, a few hours before his next shift began, a message popped up on Mansur\u2019s mobile phone: \u201cDon\u2019t go to duty,\u201d it said, and listed dozens of names as \u201cpeople stopped from Amazon.\u201d He found his own name on the list. He\u2019d been laid off. The laborers from Nepal had come to the Arabian Peninsula expecting they would be working difficult but steady jobs. Instead, they found that job security is almost nonexistent. \u201cEvery day, we fear that we could be terminated the next day. We work every day as the last day of our work,\u201d said a Nepali still working in an Amazon warehouse in Riyadh. Once laid off, workers said, a new ordeal begins. They lose housing reserved for those working at Amazon, they said, and are shunted to worse housing set aside for those without jobs. They get no wages or money for food. Many languish for weeks or months waiting for Al-Mutairi to place them back with Amazon or some other business.  During Mansur\u2019s stay, he survived by eating kuboos \u2014 Arab flatbread \u2014 once a day and borrowing money from former co-workers. Some days, he said, he didn\u2019t eat at all. When his friends could no longer support him and Al-Mutairi did not find him another job, he decided to pay the exit penalty and go back to Nepal. \u201cIt was better going home than dying of hunger,\u201d he said. Other jobless workers have slipped away from the accommodations and worked illegally in construction and restaurants without proper work papers, despite the risk that they could be detained. Loneliness, hunger and stress pushed some jobless workers toward dark turns of thought.  Manish Kumar Sodari, an Amazon worker who said he was laid off for making too many errors gathering items in the warehouse, said he spent days caring for another laid-off worker who was talking about hanging himself.  Soon, Sodari said, he began having suicidal thoughts himself.  \u201cHow can one stay helpless for three to four months?\u201d he told a reporter in January. \u201cI have already suffered a lot. I am at the last stage.\u201d He said he returned home to Nepal several months later, and is now working in India. Saudi Arabia announced reforms of its labor regulations in 2021 that authorities claim make it easier for workers to change jobs and leave the country. But human rights advocates said migrant workers in the region remain vulnerable because these limited protections have yet to be widely implemented or enforced. \u201cMigrant workers are still facing severe abuses despite these highly touted reforms,\u201d said Michael Page, a Human Rights Watch official. \u201cWorkers are still unable to change jobs easily without the permission of their old employer.\u201d Mansur feels guilty about the unpaid loans that he and his family took to get him to the Arabian Peninsula, and to bring him back to Nepal. Interest charges are piling up. He fears the village moneylenders will seize the family\u2019s land. \u201cI lost time and money working at Amazon. I lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my body and my strength. ... My family\u2019s financial situation is devastated now.\u201d But like many migrant workers around the globe, Mansur isn\u2019t going to let that harrowing experience stop him from trying to find an employer that pays a fair wage and treats him decently. He\u2019s begun to look again for an overseas job. He\u2019s open to working most anywhere \u2014 except Saudi Arabia.

        "title": "Mack Trucks employees go on strike after rejecting contract",
        "content": "Workers at Mack Trucks have gone on strike Monday after rejecting a proposed contract between the company and the United Auto Workers union. The union released a letter on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said 73% of UAW members voted against the contract and would walk off the job at 7 a.m. ET. About 4,000 UAW members work at Mack Trucks in three states. UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in a letter addressed to the company that the two sides now need to settle issues include wage increases, cost of living allowances, job security and pensions. \"We are surprised and disappointed that the UAW has chosen to strike, which we feel is unnecessary,\" Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said in a news release. Mack Trucks says terms of that deal included a 10% wage increase in the first year and a compounded 20% increase to pay over the course of the five-year agreement, with a guarantee of no increases in health insurance premiums. Mack Trucks is owned by Volvo, so the new strike is separate from the UAW dispute with Detroit's Big Three. Since Sept. 15, about 25,000 workers have walked off the job in an escalating series of strikes against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes cars under brands such as Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler. In its statement, Mack Trucks pointed to the UAW's classification of the proposal as \"a record contract for the heavy truck industry.\" The rejected agreement between the union and Mack Trucks may be a record, but it also falls short of the terms the UAW and the Big Three have discussed. The union is seeking a 40% pay increase for those members and says Ford, GM and Stellantis have all offered increases of around 20%. In his statement, Roy suggested those kinds of increases were not realistic in the trucking industry. \"The UAW called our tentative agreement \u2018a record contract for the Heavy Truck industry,\u2019 and we trust that other stakeholders also appreciate that our market, business, and competitive set are very different from those of the passenger car makers,\" he said.

        "title": "Savings simulator: Is your money beating inflation?",
        "content": "Walk past any bank and you\u2019ll likely see savings rates advertised in the window. That\u2019s because, for the first time in many years, rates have climbed to 5% on some high-yield savings accounts. Much the same goes for other common financial products, like certificates of deposits (CDs) and money market funds, as the Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates to 20-year highs. But there\u2019s a catch. \u201cAt the end of the day, there is no free lunch,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, economist and director of portfolio strategy at New York Life Investments. \u201cIf money market or cash-like yields are higher, it\u2019s likely because inflation is higher.\u201d Last year, consumer prices jumped at rates unseen since the 1980s, swiftly eroding the purchasing power of each U.S. dollar. To attract and keep depositors in this environment, banks have been dangling juicier returns. For example, a $1,000 investment in a typical \u201chigh-yield\u201d savings account in January 2021 \u2014 when inflation started picking up \u2014 was paying just 0.7% in annual interest at the time, according to Investopedia data. Then, as the Fed ratcheted rates higher to combat inflation, the rate on that same account surged to 5% by early 2023, delivering much more generous returns. As the interest compounded, that initial deposit would have grown to $1,059.72 as of this August, for a gain of $59.72 on paper. But that\u2019s before adjusting for inflation. In reality, that balance is worth only $902.86 in 2021 dollars \u2014 a $97.14 net loss in purchasing power. Some investment strategies have done a better job cushioning the blow from inflation \u2014 or even beating it \u2014 than others. But as the track record of even a high-yield savings account shows, it hasn\u2019t been easy. Try out our simulator to see for yourself. Just pick an initial investment value to explore how three common financial products\u2019 returns compare with stashing cash under the mattress. Then hit \u201cApply Inflation\u201d to see how those current-day balances look in 2021 dollars. On average, CDs \u2014 which promise a fixed rate for a deposit held for a specified period (like six months, one year or five years) \u2014 haven\u2019t done much better than savings accounts at outrunning inflation lately. A one-year CD in January 2021 offered a measly average return of 0.21% for the first year, and if a saver reinvested their balance in January 2022 after it matured, that same account was still paying a meager rate \u2014 in fact, a slightly lower one, at 0.15%, according to Bankrate data. The Fed began its rate hikes in 2022, allowing the average one-year CD rate to rise to 1.41% by January 2023. This year, some banks have been offering 5% rates on 12-month CDs, well above the national average. After twice reinvesting that $1,000 plus each year\u2019s interest in a 12-month CD since the start of 2021, a saver\u2019s balance would have grown to $1,011.79. But adjusted for inflation, the sum is worth only $862.03 in 2021 dollars, for a loss of $137.97 in purchasing power. One of the few commonplace inflation-beating strategies would have been to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 stock index. That way, a $1,000 investment in January 2021 would have grown to $1,218.49 as of this August, netting a $218.49 return. That\u2019s $1,038.14 adjusted for inflation \u2014 a $38.14 gain. Short-term gains in the stock market are hardly guaranteed, since valuations fluctuate so much day to day. (The S&P 500 has fallen since August, the end point of this analysis because inflation data isn\u2019t yet available for September.) But zoom out over at least 20 years, and stock market gains appear to offer among the most attractive returns \u2014 assuming the trend continues and you\u2019re willing to stomach some volatility, said Goodwin. \u201cOn any one-year time frame, it\u2019s highly uncertain that the investor will have positive returns on an inflation-adjusted basis,\u201d she said. However, \u201cas you extend your time horizon \u2014 five years, 10 years, 20 years \u2014 the longer you are invested [in the stock market], the more overwhelmingly likely you are to have positive inflation-adjusted returns.\u201d Of course, some people may need access to their savings sooner or live on fixed incomes that don\u2019t leave much room for weathering the market\u2019s ups and downs over a long period. It\u2019s often helpful to consult a financial planner, if possible, to tailor your savings strategy to your own situation.

        "title": "Sex, Signal messages and sabotage: SBF\u2019s top execs and Bahamas roommates tell all in court",
        "content": "Two of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s former friends from MIT, who also worked at crypto exchange FTX while living with the company co-founder in the Bahamas, took the stand in a Manhattan courtroom this week to testify against their former classmate, confidant, and boss \u2014 a man who allegedly ran a crypto empire that defrauded thousands of customers out of billions of dollars. Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, \u201cDid you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d responded Wang. He said that his crimes, including wire and commodities fraud, were carried out with the help of Bankman-Fried, FTX ex-engineering head Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, who ran sister hedge fund Alameda Research and had been Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cMr. Wang, do you see any of the people you committed those crimes with in the courtroom today?\u201d Roos continued. Wang, dressed in an oversized and wrinkled suit with a red tie and glasses, awkwardly stood up and looked around the courtroom before responding, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWho do you see?\u201d asked Roos. \u201cSam Bankman-Fried,\u201d he said. The trial, set to last six weeks, will resume on Tuesday with key testimony expected from Ellison, who is considered the prosecution\u2019s star witness, having already pleaded guilty to multiple charges. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Thus far, Bankman-Fried, 31, has remained mostly quiet in court intently listening to witnesses and at times writing notes to his attorneys. But as Wang testified against him, Bankman-Fried looked visibly upset, shifting his gaze from his former friend to the ground, and at one point putting his head in his hands. Wang, 30, was technology chief for FTX, which spiraled into bankruptcy in November. He spoke so fast that U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan and the prosecutor both stopped him at points to ask that he slow his pace. Much of Wang\u2019s testimony on Friday focused on the final days at FTX before the entire operation imploded, including reports in the media detailing Alameda\u2019s business practices and its troubling ties to FTX. Wang said that in response to the reporting an emergency meeting was called between Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh, to discuss shutting down Alameda. He said they ultimately decided against such a move because he and Bankman-Fried were aware that Alameda had no way to repay the roughly $14 billion hole in its books. Prosecutors took the jury through a series of tweets, beginning on Nov. 7. Posts came from the company blaming bank hours for slow withdrawals, while Bankman-Fried tweeted from his personal account, assuring customers that all was fine. \u201cFTX was not fine and assets were not fine,\u201d Wang testified. On Nov. 12, after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried asked Wang to drive with him to the Bahamas Securities Commission for a meeting. On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he wasn\u2019t in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried\u2019s dad was present. Wang said he returned to the U.S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial. He told jurors he signed a six-page cooperation agreement that requires him to meet with prosecutors, answer their questions truthfully and turn over evidence. For months, Bankman-Fried has known that Wang and Ellison, who were integral members of his personal and professional inner circles, had turned on him. Both pleaded guilty in December and have since been cooperating with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Wang\u2019s testimony, which stretched into Friday, was given under a cooperation agreement with the government. Ellison is expected to take the stand under a similar arrangement. Born in China, Wang moved to the U.S. at age 7 and grew up in Minnesota before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study math and computer science. He worked at Google after college. Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10% of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90%. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX\u2019s software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX $8 billion worth of customer deposits. \u201cWe gave special privileges on FTX that gave unlimited withdrawals on the platform to Alameda,\u201d Wang said. Alameda was allowed to withdraw and transfer those funds and had a $65 billion line of credit.  \u201cWhen customers deposited USD, it went to Alameda,\u201d he said. \u201cIt existed in the computer code. Alameda could have negative balances and unlimited withdrawals.\u201d   That \u201cbug\u201d in the code was written by Nishad Singh, who was FTX\u2019s director of engineering, and reviewed by Wang. Bankman-Fried was calling the shots, Wang said. Wang also told the court about a $1 million personal loan he received and a $200 million to $300 million loan in his name from Alameda that was never deposited into his account, but rather was used to make investments into other companies on behalf of FTX. That was all done by Bankman-Fried, he testified.  In early 2020, Wang said he discovered for the first time Alameda\u2019s negative balance exceeded FTX\u2019s revenue, an indication that Alameda was taking customer funds. Wang said he brought this to Bankman-Fried\u2019s attention several times.  In late 2021, Wang discovered Alameda had withdrawn $3 billion from its $65 billion line of credit. Wang\u2019s compensation was a base salary of $200,000 per year plus stock. He owned roughly 17% of FTX. Even though they were co-founders, \u201cultimately it was Sam\u2019s decision to make\u201d when there were disagreements, he said. Adam Yedidia, who was the prosecution\u2019s second witness on Wednesday, continued his testimony on Thursday. Yedidia met Bankman-Fried in college at MIT, and the pair remained close friends. Yedidia, assuming a robotic posture on the stand, worked out of FTX\u2019s Hong Kong office from January to October of 2021 and then in the Bahamas until last year\u2019s collapse. In his testimony, he referred to a group Signal thread called \u201cPeople of the House,\u201d referring to Bankman-Fried\u2019s $35 million penthouse, where many employees lived. In terms of who was paying the rent, Yedidia recalled Bankman-Fried saying he \u201cassumed it\u2019s just Alameda paying for it in the end.\u201d Yedidia said Bankman-Fried had told him before he began working in the Bahamas in 2019 that he and Ellison had sex. Bankman-Fried asked Yedidia if it was a good idea for them to date, to which Yedidia said no. Bankman-Fried responded by saying he was expecting that answer. One of Yedidia\u2019s responsibilities was fixing the bug in the code that gave Alameda preferential treatment. In June 2022, he submitted a report to Bankman-Fried on Signal that showed $8 billion in customer money held in an internal database tracking the cash wired to an Alameda account called \u201cfiat at ftx.com\u201d was missing. Yedidia said he and Bankman-Fried spoke about it at the pickleball court at the resort in Nassau, Bahamas. He asked his boss if things were OK. He was concerned because it \u201cseemed like a lot of money\u201d from FTX customers was at risk. \u201cSam said, we were bulletproof last year. We aren\u2019t bulletproof this year,\u201d Yedidia testified. Yedidia said he asked when they would be bulletproof again. Bankman-Fried said he wasn\u2019t sure, but it may be six months to three years. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried appeared \u201cworried or nervous,\u201d which he said was atypical. Still, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried and Ellison to \u201chandle the situation.\u201d On cross-examination, Christian Everdell, Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, focused on how Yedidia was the one responsible for developing and reviewing the code. He asked about the long hours employees worked and Yedidia\u2019s concern for Wang being near burnout. That resulted in Yedidia instituting a rule to not wake Wang at night for bug fixes because he needed sleep. Everdell also drilled Yedidia on his high level of compensation in his less than two years at FTX. His base salary was between $175,000 and $200,000, but he received multiple bonuses of more than $12 million in cash and company equity.  Yedidia said he\u2019s now teaching math \u2014 geometry and algebra \u2014 at a high school. He invested most of the millions he earned as bonuses back into FTX, and his equity stake is now worthless. As FTX was failing, Yedidia said he was by Bankman-Fried\u2019s side. He highlighted a Signal exchange in November 2022, during which he wrote, \u201cI love you Sam. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He said he wrote the message because so many people had left. When asked what changed, Yedidia said he learned that FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to creditors. He said Alameda\u2019s actions seemed \u201cflagrantly wrong.\u201d Yedidia\u2019s testimony ended on a fiery note, which was later struck from the record. He was asked why he had lost faith in FTX and resigned. \u201cFTX defrauded all its customers,\u201d he said.  The third witness to take the stand was Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of Paradigm, a crypto venture capital firm that invested over $275 million in FTX. That stake was wiped out. Huang testified about his firm\u2019s due diligence on FTX, and he told the court that Bankman-Fried assured him that funds would be used for FTX and not Alameda. Additionally, he was promised that Alameda had no preferential treatment on the FTX platform, even though the hedge fund was one of its top traders. Huang said he was concerned about FTX\u2019s lack of a board of directors, but he eventually invested anyway. During cross-examination, Huang said Paradigm pressed Bankman-Fried on the board issue and was told he didn\u2019t want investors as directors but he did plan on having a board with experts. CORRECTION (Oct. 8, 2023, 6:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article and a video caption misstated Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s role with FTX. He is one of two co-founders, not the sole founder.

        "title": "Homebuyers feel locked out as prices soar and mortgage interest rates hit new highs",
        "content": "In the housing market today, it feels like what goes up doesn't have to come down. It looked like home prices were finally cooling off late last year after price spikes that began during the pandemic. Nationwide, prices dipped gradually in the second half of 2022 as mortgage rates climbed in response to rising interest rates. And some areas where a lot of new homes had been built \u2014 like Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; and Charlotte, North Carolina \u2014 saw significant price declines. Granted, that was a double-edged sword for many people. Higher interest rates tend to bring home prices down, but that\u2019s because they make it more expensive for buyers to borrow money to finance their purchases. The rate hikes were not enough to undo the big price gains of the past few years, especially in parts of the U.S. where home sale prices already run well above the national average, but the change came as a relief for many people. Then something even more surprising happened early this year. Prices started going up again. Potential homebuyers who may have breathed a sigh of relief a few months ago are now staring at an improbable double whammy: Prices are at all-time highs even with mortgage rates at 23-year highs. The average U.S. rate for a 30-year mortgage was 7.49% on October 5, according to government-backed lender Fannie Mae. In fact, an NBC News analysis of data from Zillow found that estimated mortgage payments have increased in more than 500 cities since the end of 2020, with payments doubling in more than half of cities. Tracy Jolson-Halperin, a New York City resident who works in medical device sales, said she and her husband have been looking for a house for a year now. At first they tried to wait, thinking that rising mortgage interest rates would bring prices down and make bidding wars less intense. But that hasn't happened in the areas where they're looking. They started with a well-above-average budget of $1 million and hoped to find a three- or four-bedroom house near a train line, and the couple felt that time was on their side. \"We had to increase the towns we were looking at, taper our expectations a lot, and increase our budget,\" she told NBC News. They initially hoped to buy a house in Westchester, but Jolson-Halperin has accepted that she and her family are more likely to find what they're looking for in Connecticut. She said she\u2019s expecting a two-hour commute to New York City on some days and has considered fixer-uppers and towns with less-impressive school districts. On some properties, she said, they made offers while dropping mortgage contingencies \u2014 the mechanism buyers use as an offramp from a purchase in case certain issues arise \u2014 and went as much as $100,000 above the asking price on a house they were outbid on. None of that worked. She said they've decided to slow down and rent instead. \"We figure we'll rent outside of the city, get to know the towns,\" she said. \"We feel like we missed out.\" Jolson-Halperin added: \"Prices in the areas that we really liked were just going up and up. It seemed like with every sale the houses were going further and further up and we were starting to get priced out.\" As of the most recent data in July, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index is at a record high, 1% above its mark from a year earlier. The increase in prices from the last few months has canceled out the late-2022 dip. In a news release, S&P said prices rose in all 20 of the largest cities it tracks, and suggested they will probably keep going up. The new problem is that few people want to sell, even if there's never been a better time for them to cash in on their house. The National Association of Realtors says there were about 1.1 million unsold existing homes on the market in August, down almost 15% from a year ago. Greg McBride, Bankrate chief financial analyst, told NBC News that as rates go up, people who bought their homes years ago and locked in mortgages at 3% or 4% interest rates become less and less likely to move. That means supplies are low, which has sent prices up again. \"The reversal that we\u2019ve seen in the housing market has come despite rising mortgage rates because the dominant dynamic is the extremely limited supply of homes available for sale,\" McBride said. \"In many markets, that's contributed to higher prices. In others, it's put a floor under prices or limited price declines.\" Even realtors are sounding the alarm, since they're not happy with the shortage of homes to sell. In a Sept. 28 news release, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said the supply of homes needs to double just to moderate the recent gains in prices. McBride said prices will stop rising eventually, but even then, they will probably become stable instead of decreasing much, at least on a nationwide level. Prices could come down in response to higher rates, but that's going to take much longer. \"There will be a tipping point at which higher rates siphon off enough demand that even with limited supply, there's no longer fuel to push prices higher,\" he said. \"At what point does this very limited supply picture improve? It's probably not going to happen with mortgage rates around 8%.\" Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital. Jasmine Cui is a reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "UAW leadership holds off on new strikes as Big Three talks continue",
        "content": "The United Auto Workers strike against the Big Three U.S. automakers continues, but union President Shawn Fain said Friday that the labor stoppage isn't expanding as the walkout closes out its third week. In a 2 p.m. Facebook Live event, Fain said General Motors agreed in writing that electric battery manufacturing will be covered in the next contract between GM and the union. He described that as a major win that will change the auto industry. He said the threat of a strike at another major GM plant convinced the company to change its stance. \"We were about to shut down GM's largest moneymaker in Arlington, Texas,\" Fain said. Full size-SUVs for the Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac brands are made there. Electric vehicle manufacturing plants, and the people who work there, have been an important point in the strike. The employees at those plants aren\u2019t members of the UAW, and they make less money than union members. Ford, GM, and Stellantis, the former Fiat Chrysler, all partner with South Korean companies to make those batteries. \u201cWe've been told the EV future must be a race to the bottom, and now we\u2019ve called their bluff,\" Fain said. \"The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants, and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs.\" General Motors said it is continuing to negotiate. It did not confirm the concessions Fain described. About 25,000 auto workers have gone on strike since the UAW's contract with Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors expired at midnight ET on September 15. It was the first time the union simultaneously went on strike against all three companies. Since then, the UAW had announced additional strike locations every Friday, with more workers walking off the job at noon ET each time. That changed this week. The union wants to include 40% annual pay raises over four years; a 32-hour workweek, down from the current 40; an end to wage tiers; better pensions for retirees; cost of living adjustments; and improved healthcare. They cite record profits for the car companies in recent years and the benefits union members gave up after the 2007-08 Great Recession nearly took down the Big Three. The automakers have offered record contracts with pay increases of around 20% as well as bonuses and other improved benefits, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to keep the strike from stretching on. While workers from all three companies are striking, the UAW has spared the companies additional strikes at different times to reward them for making progress in talks. A week ago, GM and Ford were targeted for strike expansions while Stellantis, which makes Dodge and Chrysler and Jeep vehicles, was not. It's a strategy intended to keep the companies off-guard and snarl their production and supply lines while taking fewer workers off the job. Soon after it started, the automakers began laying off workers in various locations, saying there was no work for them because of strikes elsewhere. GM has laid off more than 2,100 employees since the strike began, with Ford adding more than 600, and Stellantis has furloughed around 370 people. The Washington Post recently reported that auto suppliers connected to the Detroit Big Three have laid off more than 3,000 of their workers as well.

        "title": "Biden touts better-than-expected job growth in September",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Friday touted the unexpectedly high employment gains in September's jobs report in remarks at the White House. The U.S. added about 336,000 jobs in September, nearly twice the Dow Jones prediction of 170,000 jobs and above the monthly average of 267,000 jobs over the past year, according to the newly released report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in September stayed the same at 3.8%. \"My dad had an expression. He said, 'Joey, a job's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay, and mean it,''\" Biden said. \"Well, 336,000 more Americans, if they have children, can say that to their children and mean it.\" Biden credited the positive jobs report to his economic policies, which his administration has dubbed \"Bidenomics.\" \"It's no accident. It's Bidenomics,\" Biden said. \"We're growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\" The job gains took place in the leisure and hospitality, government, and health care industries, among others. The labor force participation rate \u2014 which includes those working or looking for work \u2014 also remained steady at 62.8%. The news comes as the White House announced the third Investing in America tour, intended \"to highlight how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out in communities across the country,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in Thursday's press briefing. As part of the tour, senior administration officials, as well as the president and vice president, will traverse the country, \"making dozens of stops in the coming two weeks,\" the White House said in a news release. Biden also noted that Friday is National Manufacturing Day, which celebrates those who work in the U.S. manufacturing sector. \"For too long, too many of us have been told to give up on American manufacturing. I will never do that,\" Biden said in White House proclamation Thursday. \"We are living through one of the greatest industrial revivals in our Nation\u2019s history. There is no one that America cannot outcompete.\" The president slammed House GOP's economic agenda, which he claimed had brought the U.S. to \"the brink of a government shutdown, creating unnecessary instability and risk in order to secure more extreme cuts in programs that help working Americans and seniors.\" He urged House Republicans to \"stop fooling around.\" \"It's time for you to do your job, continue our progress growing the economy, investing in America, investing in the American people,\" Biden said. Biden has recently been struggling with lagging poll numbers on his handling of the economy. In a September NBC News poll, only 37% of voters approved of how he has handled the economy, while 28% of voters said they were satisfied with the state of the economy.

        "title": "Payrolls soared by 336,000 in September, defying expectations for a hiring slowdown",
        "content": "Job growth was stronger than expected in September, a sign that the U.S. economy is hanging tough despite higher interest rates, labor strife and dysfunction in Washington. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 336,000 for the month, better than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 170,000 and more than 100,000 higher than the previous month, the Labor Department said Friday in a much-anticipated report. The unemployment rate was 3.8%, compared to the forecast for 3.7%. Stock market futures turned sharply negative following the report and Treasury yields jumped. Dow futures were down more than 250 pints, while the 10-year Treasury yield soared 0.17 percentage point to 4.87%, up around its highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis. The payrolls increase was the best monthly number since January. \u201cSlowdown? What slowdown? The U.S. labor market continues to exhibit amazing strength, with the number of new jobs created last month nearly twice as large as expected,\u201d said George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank. Investors have been on edge lately that a resilient economy could force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high and perhaps even hike more as inflation remains elevated. Wage increases, however, were softer than expected, with average hourly earnings up 0.2% for the month and 4.2% from a year ago, compared to respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.3%. Still, traders in the fed funds futures market increased the odds of a rate increase before the end of the year to about 44%, according to the CME Group\u2019s tracker. \u201cClearly it\u2019s moving up expectations that the Fed is not done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cAll else equal, it probably moves the start point for rate cuts, which has been a moving target, to later in 2024.\u201d Sonders said the bond market is \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d as far as stocks go, a trend that accelerated earlier in the week after the Labor Department reported a jump in job openings for August. From a sector perspective, leisure and hospitality led with 96,000 new jobs. Other gainers included government (73,000), health care (41,000) and professional, scientific and technical services (29,000). Motion picture and sound recording jobs fell by 5,000 and are down 45,000 since May amid a labor impasse in Hollywood. Service-related industries contributed 234,000 to the total job growth, while goods-producing industries added just 29,000. Average hourly earnings in the leisure and hospitality industry were flat on the month, though up 4.7% from a year ago. The private sector payrolls gain of 263,000 was well ahead of a report earlier this week from ADP, which indicated an increase of just 89,000. In addition to the powerful September, the previous two months saw substantial upward revisions. August\u2019s gain is now 227,000, up 40,000 from the prior estimate, while July went to 236,000, from 157,000. Combined, the two months were 119,000 higher than previously reported. The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, was a bit lighter, rising 215,000. The labor force participation rate, or those working against the total size of the workforce, held steady at 62.8%, still a half percentage point below the pre-Covid pandemic level. The rate for those in the 25-to-54 age group also was unchanged at 83.5%. A more encompassing measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons edged down to 7%. The September report comes at a critical time for the markets and economy. Treasury yields have surged and stocks have slumped amid concern that a still-hot economy could keep Federal Reserve policy tight. The central bank has raised interest rates 5.25 percentage points since March 2022 in an attempt to curb inflation that is still running well ahead of the Fed\u2019s 2% target. In recent days, multiple policymakers have said they are still concerned about inflation. They largely have cautioned that while another rate hike before the end of the year is an open question, rates are almost certain to stay at an elevated level for \u201csome time.\u201d Though market pricing puts little chance on the Fed hiking again, the higher-for-longer narrative has been causing angst for investors. Higher interest rates raise the cost of capital and run counter to the easy monetary policy that has underpinned Wall Street strength for much of the past 14 years. A strong job market is central to the rates equation. Policymakers feel that a tight labor picture will continue to put upward pressure on wages which then will push prices higher. Fed officials have said they don\u2019t believe wages played a role in the initial inflation surge in 2021-22, but have become more of a factor lately.

        "title": "NBA can shift the balance of power in media with its next rights deal",
        "content": "The National Basketball Association\u2019s upcoming decision on which companies will acquire the TV and streaming rights for its live games could transform the entire media industry. Based on preliminary discussions between media executives and league officials, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, Google\u2019s YouTube TV, Amazon, Apple and even Netflix may challenge or join the incumbents as rights holders, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Spokespeople at NBCUniversal, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Netflix declined to comment. (Comcast owns NBCUniveresal, the parent company of NBC News and CNBC.) Every media rights renewal for the NBA is an important event because it only happens about once a decade. The last rights deal was announced in 2014. The NBA\u2019s current rights deal ends after the 2024-25 season. All expressions of interest between media partners and the NBA have been preliminary because league officials can\u2019t officially negotiate with interested partners until April, when the league\u2019s exclusive negotiating window with incumbent media rights partners Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery ends. But with the National Football League\u2019s media rights locked up until 2033, the NBA has a unique opportunity to play media kingmaker. Live sports have continuously increased in value for decades as advertisers clamor for live events where commercials can\u2019t be skipped. The NBA will likely get a significant increase on its new media deal. Former ESPN head John Skipper predicted earlier this year the league could get between 200% and 350% more in its new agreement. \u201cOur next set of media deals will help shape the future of our league and how fans consume NBA basketball for years to come,\u201d an NBA spokesperson said. Netflix\u2019s potential interest in the NBA could be industry-shaking. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has repeatedly said Netflix hasn\u2019t encountered a viable path to carrying live sports that would appeal to its shareholders. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen a profit path to renting big sports,\u201d he said in December. But Sarandos has recently softened his stance from disinterest in the NBA to potential interest, according to people familiar with the matter. What that means is still unknown. It\u2019s unlikely the NBA would hand over its largest package of streaming games to a provider that\u2019s never had experience with live sports, said the people. Netflix has contemplated buying sports rights before. The world\u2019s largest streamer unsuccessfully bid for live Formula 1 racing rights last year. But the biggest change for Netflix is the company\u2019s push to add customers to its advertising-supported tier, which launched in November. About 5 million subscribers had signed up for its ad tier, which costs $6.99 per month, Netflix announced in May. Netflix said earlier this year it makes more money off subscribers who select the cheaper ad-supported tier than its $15.49 standard tier, which doesn\u2019t include advertising. The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for the advertising tier would likely rise even more if Netflix added a package of NBA games, which would command premium-priced ad rates unlike anything currently on Netflix\u2019s service. Disney and Amazon have also adjusted their streaming offerings to account for the media industry\u2019s recent revelation that there\u2019s enough digital advertising demand to push ARPU just as high as or even higher than their higher-priced no-ad subscription products. Disney is increasing its ad-free pricing on Disney+ by 27% later this month while keeping the price of ad-free Disney+ stagnant. Amazon plans to inject commercials into its previously ad-free Prime Video in 2024. The NBA would be a particularly valuable addition to an ad-supported streaming service because its season runs from October to June, including playoffs. That\u2019s an effective churn reducer for fans, who won\u2019t be able to binge-watch a season of live games like they do with on-demand entertainment series. Netflix sells an ad-supported plan in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. That global reach is appealing for the NBA, which features an assortment of international stars, including Slovenian Luka Don\u010di\u0107 of the Dallas Mavericks, Serbian Nikola Joki\u0107 of the NBA champion Denver Nuggets and French rookie Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs. It\u2019s also possible the league could decide to maximize its domestic reach by striking a new deal with NBCUniversal, which has both a broadcast network and a streaming service, Peacock, that could serve as homes for live games. NBC has a nostalgic relationship with fans, dating back to the Michael Jordan-dominated days of the 1990s\u2019 \u201cThe NBA on NBC.\u201d CNBC first reported NBCUniversal\u2019s interest in again airing NBA games earlier this year. Still, Peacock has just 24 million subscribers, fewer than Disney\u2019s ESPN+ or Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s Max, and is only available within the U.S. Broadening reach is important to league officials, who are intrigued by Google\u2019s YouTube TV as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. YouTube TV struck a deal to be the NFL\u2019s exclusive \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d provider earlier this year. NBA executives have been impressed with the production quality and user experience, said the people. While YouTube TV, a subscription bundle of linear channels a la traditional pay TV, is only available in the U.S., the league already has an existing global partnership with YouTube that includes providing highlights, game recaps, full-length games and produced segments. YouTube has more than 2.7 billion global monthly active users and can market the sport to a younger audience than Amazon or Apple can do with their subscription services. The average age of an NBA viewer is 49, and 26% of viewers are under 35, according to Nielsen. Between Amazon and Apple, league officials are currently more comfortable with choosing Amazon as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon has proven to the NBA it is serious about making a large investment in live sports, including its $1 billion per year contract to carry \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d While Apple has deals to carry Major League Soccer and \u201cFriday Night Baseball\u201d for Major League Baseball, the NBA isn\u2019t convinced Apple will prioritize marketing the league\u2019s games in the same way other streaming services might. Apple TV+ has never disclosed how many subscribers it has. Apple will have a chance to make its pitch directly to the league if and when the NBA begins discussions with other partners after its exclusive window with incumbents expires. It\u2019s possible Apple or Netflix could get a smaller package of games from the NBA as a test run for a future larger partnership. Still, that would run counter to the league\u2019s preference to limit the number of packages it wishes to dole out. The NBA will have to balance demand against restricting supply to maximize the price for rights. The league probably wants to have just two or three media partners to serve broadcast, cable and streaming eyeballs, according to people familiar with the matter. Spreading packages between too many media partners will potentially confuse and annoy consumers, who will need to sign up for multiple services and then find where games are streaming on a given day. Currently, an NBA game could appear on Disney\u2019s ESPN or ABC, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s TNT, NBA TV, NBA League Pass or a regional sports network. Add new streaming services to the mix, and consumers could easily become overwhelmed with options. Likewise, if the NBA doesn\u2019t reach a new deal with either ESPN or TNT and goes in another direction, it may accelerate the deterioration of the cable bundle \u2014 as live sports is one of the last pillars keeping it alive. The league hopes to mitigate some of this complexity by marketing its NBA app and NBA.com as digital \u201cfront doors\u201d to discover content, according to people familiar with the matter. The league hopes to get fans in the habit of first opening the app or NBA.com before being directly ported to a streaming service that\u2019s broadcasting the game or potentially staying and watching games in-app, depending on partnership arrangements. This is a similar concept to what ESPN has considered, as CNBC reported earlier this year. Alex Sherman covers technology, media and telecommunications for CNBC.  ",

        "title": "Putin may be planning a major escalation in the Black Sea, British intelligence warns",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Britain says it has intelligence that Russia is trying to target civilian cargo ships carrying grain in the Black Sea by laying sea mines and planning to blame any attacks on Ukraine. The U.K. did not provide any evidence for the allegation, which comes as Ukraine appears to be gaining momentum in the fight over the crucial sea, which is both Kyiv\u2019s main export corridor and a launchpad for Russian attacks. A senior Ukrainian official said Russia has been laying more mines in the Black Sea because its ships\u2019 commanders fear getting too close to the shore and being struck by Ukrainian missiles. Ukraine has in recent weeks hit back at Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet with a wave of strikes, leading analysts and officials to suggest that the Kremlin may have been forced to pull back some of its ships to safer waters and away from a home it has historically used to project power across Europe and Asia. While Kyiv's counteroffensive has yet to achieve a breakthrough on the battlefield, success in the Black Sea could help loosen the Kremlin's grip on the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Against the backdrop of such attacks, the British Foreign Office said in a statement Wednesday that Russia wants to \u201cdeter the export of Ukrainian grain\u201d by covertly targeting cargo ships. \u201cInformation declassified today shows Russia may continue to target civilian shipping in the Black Sea, including by laying sea mines in the approach to Ukrainian ports,\u201d it said. \u201cRussia almost certainly wants to avoid openly sinking civilian ships, instead falsely laying blame on Ukraine for any attacks against civilian vessels in the Black Sea.\u201d Ukraine says it has, indeed, seen Russia laying more mines in the Black Sea, said Andrii Chernyak, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence agency. \"The Russian warships can\u2019t\" get close enough to the Ukrainian coastline, \"as they are afraid of being hit by our missiles,\" he said. So they have \"really put efforts to mine the sea to the maximum, as they still aim to make navigation in the Black Sea impossible.\" Part of the reason the Black Sea is so important is that Kyiv has traditionally used it to export grain and other agricultural products, of which it is one of the world\u2019s top producers and sellers. Russia abandoned a deal in July that allowed Ukraine to export food products, hiking international food prices and threatening a hunger crisis in some of the poorest parts of the world. Since then, Ukraine has set up a \u201chumanitarian corridor,\u201d defying the de facto Russian blockade. And it is that corridor that the British Foreign Office says Russia seeks to target. \u201cThe world is watching \u2014 and we see right through Russia\u2019s cynical attempts to lay blame on Ukraine for their attacks,\u201d Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Spain on Thursday rallying support from European leaders at a summit he said would focus on \u201cjoint work for global food security and protection of freedom of navigation\u201d in the Black Sea. Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians, but it has a well-documented record of carrying out attacks on civilian and nonmilitary infrastructure in Ukraine, as well as in previous conflicts in Syria, Georgia and Chechnya. The Russian Defense Ministry has not responded to a request for comment about the British allegations. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual keynote foreign policy event, in the Russian city of Sochi, which is also on the Black Sea. Putin has suffered setbacks in the area after a series of high-profile attacks by Ukraine since August. Kyiv claims to have damaged several ships and a submarine and injured or killed dozens of officers. The commander of the Russian fleet was, however, shown in video a day after Ukraine claimed he had been killed. \u201cUkraine\u2019s success in the Battle of the Black Sea is all the more remarkable as the country does not currently have a functioning navy,\u201d the Atlantic Council wrote in a briefing Wednesday. \u201cInstead, Ukraine has relied on daring commando raids along with a combination of domestically produced drones and long-range cruise missiles provided by the country\u2019s Western partners.\u201d Despite the \u201climited arsenal,\u201d the attacks have \u201cbeen deployed with the kind of ingenuity that has become the calling card of the Ukrainian military,\u201d it said. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Black Sea Fleet had withdrawn the bulk of its ships from its main base in Sevastopol, in the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which Russia occupied in 2014, to its base in Novorossiysk, a port on the Russian mainland. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that he could not comment on the report and that it was a matter for the Defense Ministry, which has not responded to a request for comment. Dmytro Pletenchuk, a Ukrainian naval spokesman, said at a news briefing Wednesday that the ships \u201ctry to visit Sevastopol\u2019s port as rarely as possible because they do not feel the same level of security as they are used to in this port.\u201d But he also suggested the maneuvers were at least partly routine and that Russia tries \u201cto periodically move their ships between their ports.\u201d Chernyak, the military intelligence spokesman, said Russia was trying to \"hide\" its ships to stop their being sunk by Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia has signed a deal to house a permanent naval base in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, also on the Black Sea, its leader told local media Thursday. That would re-establish an old Soviet-era base, and it could suggest an attempt to diversify the number of ports open to the fleet. Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, and Alexander Smith from London.

        "title": "Cyberattack cost MGM Resorts about $100 million, Las Vegas company says",
        "content": "The criminal cyberattack on MGM Resorts in Las Vegas last month resulted in the company\u2019s losing around $100 million, it said in a filing Thursday evening with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The admission is a rare insight into the giant sums that major companies can lose when they fall victim to significant hacks. MGM, whose prominent casinos along the Las Vegas Strip include the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, were hacked last month. The company said it deliberately shut down a number of services \u201cto mitigate risk to customer information.\u201d The shutdown had severe impacts for MGM. Some hotel customers couldn\u2019t use key cards to enter their rooms. Employees were locked out of corporate emails for days. The tech news website 404 Media found entire sections of slot machines at MGM casinos roped off. The fallout stood in sharp contrast what happened to rival Caesars Entertainment, which disclosed that it had been hacked around the same time. Caesars indicated in its SEC filing that it may have paid the hackers to go away. In an open letter also published Thursday evening, MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle said that \u201cthe vast majority of our systems have been restored,\u201d adding, \u201cWe also believe that this attack is contained.\u201d Even though those systems were shut down, the hackers did access some customer information. While customer bank account information and credit card numbers appear untouched, the hackers stole some customers\u2019 personal information, including names, driver\u2019s license numbers and Social Security numbers, Hornbuckle said.

        "title": "As Cuba's private sector grows, entrepreneurs get a warm welcome in Miami",
        "content": "MIAMI \u2014 On a recent morning, dozens of entrepreneurs from communist-run Cuba attended a conference in Miami to learn more about how to improve their businesses and work within the confines of the U.S. embargo. It was a rare moment. Never before had a large group of Cuban entrepreneurs traveled to the U.S., given the limitations that have been placed by both governments in the last decades, along with the hard-line policy many Cuban Americans in Miami have advocated. Diosdado Delfino, who has owned a business in Havana since 2012 that repairs and paints buildings, was at the conference last week in the Brickell area of Miami trying to figure out how he could purchase equipment more easily, like paint and protective gear, when he\u2019s back in Cuba. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I come to Miami, and I think it\u2019s fantastic,\" said Delfino, sounding optimistic about his prospects. \"I would like to do business here in the future.\" The private sector has been growing in Cuba, and by some estimates has replaced the state as the largest employer. Private businesses are active in a range of industries, including furniture, apparel, food and software. Some of their most ardent supporters include a growing number of Cuban Americans in Miami who want to see the private sector strengthen in the communist island and, to an extent, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The conference was largely organized by a former Florida congressman, Joe Garc\u00eda, a Democrat and a Cuban American. \u201cWe were able to gather 70 entrepreneurs from Cuba, with some of the most successful Cuban American businesses in the world,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. \u201cThey were super thrilled. Many of them had never been to the United States. And Miami is the most important market for Cuba, just by the nature of the geography.\u201d Garc\u00eda is considering more events like this in the future. Cuba\u2019s private sector now employs over 1.6 million people, more than the state, according to an analysis by Juan Triana, an economist with the Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy, based at the University of Havana. (The state employs 1.5 million, according to the Ministry of Economy.) The private sector also offers workers better salaries and more job options than the state. Since Cuba in 2021 lifted a ban on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often called mipymes in Spanish, over 9,100 businesses have been approved and registered by the government, according to the latest government numbers published in September. In the last two years, Cuba's small businesses have generated over 250,000 jobs, according to the government. In the first six months of this year, SMEs imported $264 million and exported $6.3 million worth of goods, Cuba\u2019s economy minister, Alejandro Gil, said before the national assembly in July. He predicted that by the end of 2023, the private sector will have imported $1 billion in goods. Supporting Cuba\u2019s private sector is one of the few points where the U.S. and Cuban governments see eye-to-eye at a time when relations continue to be sour. At the Miami conference, many Cuban entrepreneurs rubbed elbows with some of the city's Cuban American business elite. \u201cIt is fascinating to see how eager and hungry they are,\u201d said Mike Fern\u00e1ndez, a businessman who came from Cuba when he was 12. \u201cGiven the right mentorship, they will excel. They will fail 50 times, but that\u2019s what makes them strong. They will continue to stand up.\u201d John Kavulich, head of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a nonpartisan group based in New York, said at the conference that \u201cthe goal is to provide the Cuban companies with information that\u2019s executable, rather than political 'Kumbaya.'\u201d \u201cThat it\u2019s happening in Miami and it\u2019s public is also critically important,\u201d Kavulich said. For many Cubans who have been isolated from capitalism for most of their lives, starting a business is challenging and they lack the know-how. They are also dealing with heavy regulations, shortages and a U.S. embargo. One of the biggest challenges private businesses face is they have to import and export through state-run companies. Financing is limited. The U.S. embassy in Havana has held events for Cuban entrepreneurs, including training programs and seminars. A U.S. State Department official told NBC News, \u201cThe Biden Administration seeks to foster the Cuban people\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and create opportunities for independent private sector entrepreneurs to grow their businesses.\u201d It is rumored the administration is preparing new measures that would allow Cuban business owners to access the U.S. banking system and allow them to operate them from Cuba or a third country. In the years after the 1959 revolution, Fidel Castro\u2019s government seized private properties and installed a socialist state. In 1968 incorporated businesses were outlawed through a campaign known as the \u201cRevolutionary Offensive\u201d and the remnants of the private sector were eliminated; most private companies were nationalized. The country moved to a Soviet-style, centrally planned economy where virtually everyone was employed by the state and all imports and exports were controlled by the government. In the decades that followed a small number of Cubans continued to offer private services for a limited amount of clients. Eventually, in 1993, a law was passed that allowed people to work \u201cpor cuenta propia,\u201d a euphemism for private business, a term communist leaders were uneasy with. The industries in which these businesses were allowed to operate were limited and they were heavily regulated, but they opened a crack in the state-dominated economy. The law was passed in the midst of an economic meltdown following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had been subsidizing the island. In 2011 the rights of the \u201cself-employed\u201d were expanded and they were allowed to employ workers. A law expanding those rights was passed in September 2021 as Cuba was undergoing another dire economic crisis that has led to shortages in food, medicine and power, as well as rising inflation, historic protests and the largest exodus of Cubans in the nation's history. Now, with the 2021 law, all businesses that have more than three workers must be registered with the Ministry of Economy as an SME, or mipyme, essentially a limited liability company. They can have up to 100 employees and can operate in most industries, except education, health, mining, defense and several other areas. As with many issues pertaining to the island, Cubans on either side of the Florida straits don't always agree on how to encourage Cuba's private sector. Some in Miami say that those with close ties to the government are benefitting from opening businesses and that the private sector only serves to strengthen a repressive government. And a new generation of Cuban Americans that have come to the city in recent years prefer a hard-line policy on Cuba.  In Cuba, the conference drew criticism on state-run media because one event in Miami took place at the home of a Cuban American exile who the Cuban government called a \"terrorist\" for allegedly trying to overthrow the government. Despite such criticism in the U.S. and Cuba, the conference was considered a breakthrough by many, according to Garc\u00eda. \u201cI think we had a significant historical event in the heart of Miami, which is the central issue in the debate,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. \u201cPeople tend to think \u2014 the Cuban government in particular \u2014 that their debate is with Washington. The debate isn\u2019t with Washington, it\u2019s with the Cuban American community and its power in Washington.\u201d Carmen Sesin reported from Miami and Orlando Matos from Havana.

        "title": "Walmart says users of weight loss drugs are buying less food",
        "content": "Walmart says people who get weight loss drugs like Wegovy at its pharmacies are buying a bit less food at its stores. Walmart's U.S. CEO, John Furner, told Bloomberg News that the company is seeing signs that people taking GLP-1 agonist appetite suppressant medications are buying \"less units, slightly less calories.\" GLP-1 agonists include semaglutide, which is sold under the name Ozempic as a Type 2 diabetes treatment and Wegovy as a weight loss drug; as well as Mounjaro and Victoza. The retail giant is comparing shoppers who pick up a prescription for those medications at its pharmacies to shoppers who are otherwise similar but aren't filling those scripts at Walmart. Using anonymized data, it's looking for patterns in the spending of those groups, and it says the first group is buying less food. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, Inc., said in August that the growing popularity of the drugs was helping its sales. According to Trilliant Health, prescriptions of those medications quadrupled from late 2020 to 2022, with 9 million prescriptions filled in the last three months of last year. Walmart previously recorded stronger grocery sales when high inflation was driving wealthier shoppers to its stores. In summer 2022, after inflation had topped out at 9.1%, the company said it saw more customers in higher income brackets shunning expensive grocery stores in favor of Walmart's lower prices. In a company earnings release at the time, McMillion said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see more customers choosing Walmart during this inflationary period, and we\u2019re working hard to support them as they prioritize their spending.\u201d Marley Jay is a business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "First witness in Sam Bankman-Fried trial was cocoa bean trader who lost $100,000 to FTX",
        "content": "Marc-Antoine Julliard typically trades cocoa beans. But in the spring of 2021, the London-based commodities broker decided to diversify into cryptocurrency trading. His platform of choice was FTX. Two years later, Julliard stood as the prosecution\u2019s first witness in the criminal fraud trial against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who\u2019s accused of misusing billions of dollars in client money. In testimony that lasted around 50 minutes on Wednesday, Julliard recounted his experience with FTX, including the \u201cextremely anxious\u201d feeling he had the day he unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw part of the $100,000 worth of crypto and cash he had stored on the site. He and thousands of other FTX customers were practically wiped out when the exchange went belly up late last year. Like many others, Julliard said he he was under the impression that there were \u201cstrong financials behind the company.\u201d Julliard is the poster child for the case the prosecution laid out in its opening statement as it tries to prove to a jury that clients were led to believe the money they stored with FTX was safe. Prospective customers, Julliard said, were drawn in through savvy marketing, with no reason to believe that FTX would be repurposing their crypto funds. In a trial that\u2019s set to last six weeks, Bankman-Fried, a man once revered as the \u201cwhite knight\u201d of crypto, faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. A jury was seated shortly after 11:30 a.m. (though four of the 12 jurors were already looking to be dismissed). Opening statements began about an hour later. Julliard took the stand just before 2 p.m. to a packed courthouse in Manhattan. As the lead witness, Julliard helped lay out the government\u2019s narrative. Much of his decision to buy into FTX had to do with the celebrities and venture funds attached to the brand. He referenced an ad with supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen and Formula 1 marketing. He also pointed to prolific media coverage, which bolstered his trust in the company. Julliard wasn\u2019t an aggressive crypto trader. He said he never participated in margin trading, or borrowing money to make purchases, nor did he engage in a lending program offered by the company that allowed users to earn interest on idle crypto. The defense is trying to make clients accountable for what it says were their choices to buy and trade crypto. \u201cSam didn\u2019t defraud anyone,\u201d said Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, in his opening statement. Cohen called it a \u201chindsight case\u201d brought by the government, and said that just because people lost money, doesn\u2019t mean the 31-year-old Bankman-Fried committed fraud.  Bankman-Fried donned a fresh suit with a purple tie and a clean haircut \u2014 a much different look than the beach shorts, sandals and wild curls that helped define his image during crypto\u2019s heyday. The entrepreneur, who Cohen described as a \u201cmath nerd that didn\u2019t drink or party,\u201d diligently took notes on his air-gapped laptop as he conversed with both of his attorneys and, during breaks, sometimes stood while emphatically motioning with his hands as he spoke to his counsel. Throughout both sides\u2019 opening statements, Bankman-Fried kept his eyes trained on the jury box. His head was turned 90 degrees to his right to watch those who will ultimately decide his fate. Bankman-Fried was joined in court by his parents, who are both being sued by FTX\u2019s new management for having allegedly \u201cexploited their access and influence within the FTX enterprise to enrich themselves\u2026by millions of dollars.\u201d Cohen is projecting Bankman-Fried as a startup founder and equated running FTX and Alameda Research, his sister hedge fund, to \u201cbuilding a plane while flying on it.\u201d He told the jury that there was no risk management in place. Specifically, he said the firm didn\u2019t have a chief risk officer. Far from the \u201ccartoon of a villain\u201d that the government presented, Cohen gave different explanations for his client\u2019s supposedly illegal actions. One example dealt with the secret backdoor baked into FTX\u2019s code that prosecutors say gave Alameda a way to borrow much needed capital. Cohen said there was nothing secretive about this backchannel in the code base and said the special access to FTX was there because Alameda was initially set up as a market maker for the crypto exchange, which needed the liquidity, especially in its early days. Cohen reminded the jury that the three insiders who will take the stand against Bankman-Fried have all signed cooperation agreements with the government. The prosecution\u2019s opening statement was delivered by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn. Over the course of about a half hour, Rehn drove home the point that everyday investors were the ones who fell victim to FTX\u2019s scheme. By the summer of 2022, he said, more than $10 billion had been stolen from thousands of FTX customers who had trusted custody of their crypto and cash to the platform. Rehn said the evidence would show jurors how Bankman-Fried lied to FTX users, investors and lenders, and how he spent a good amount of the money he stole for his own good. Rehn referenced campaign contributions, for example, as one way that Bankman-Fried looked to curry favor on Capitol Hill. Rehn called Alameda a \u201csecond, smaller and more secretive company\u201d founded and controlled by Bankman-Fried that was integral to the defendant\u2019s alleged scheme. The government also teed up its star witness, ex-girlfriend and Alameda\u2019s ex-CEO, Caroline Ellison. She pleaded guilty in December to multiple charges and has been cooperating with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan for months. Rehn plans to show that Bankman-Fried installed his girlfriend at the top of his hedge fund, though he remained the one calling the shots behind the scenes. Noticeably absent was the mention of Ellison\u2019s co-CEO Sam Trabucco, who was a classmate of Bankman-Fried at MIT. Trabucco left FTX in Aug. 2022, and has stayed relatively under the radar. Also central to the government\u2019s case is the alleged coverup to hide Bankman-Fried\u2019s crimes. Those tactics include backdating contracts and using encrypted messaging apps set to auto-delete to avoid a paper trail. \u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,\u201d Rein said, as he closed his statement.  The prosecution\u2019s second witness was Adam Yedidia, who met Bankman-Fried in college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The pair remained good friends. Yedida detailed his experience working first as a trader at Alameda for two months in 2017, and later as a software engineer for FTX beginning in January 2021. He said he resigned from FTX the day before the exchange filed for bankruptcy after a fellow developer told him that Alameda had used FTX customer deposits to pay back creditors. Speaking quickly and deliberately with an air of practiced nonchalance, Yedida testified that he hadn\u2019t talked to Bankman-Fried or seen him in person since Nov. 2022. When asked why he was appearing under an immunity order, Yedida said he was concerned that as an FTX developer, he \u201cmay have unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime.\u201d Prosecutors got through a half hour of testimony before breaking for the day. The government will continue its questioning of Yedida at 9:30 A.M. on Thursday.  FTX co-founder Gary Wang will also be taking the stand this week for the government.

        "content": "Operations were rescheduled, chemotherapy treatments were canceled and other procedures deemed \u201cnon-urgent\u201d were postponed as tens of thousands of health care workers nationwide began to strike Wednesday. In what union leaders call the largest health care worker strike in U.S. history, more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente employees across five states walked off the job this week, demanding better working conditions amid failed contract negotiations.  The strike, expected to last three days in some areas, affects more than 40 Kaiser Permanente hospitals and medical office buildings in California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Virginia and Washington, D.C., according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. The majority of striking workers are in California, where Kaiser Permanente, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit health care organization, is based.  Disruptions left patients in the state reeling.  In Sacramento, toddler Caden Young had been scheduled to undergo ear tube surgery Thursday after having suffered from recurring ear infections, but the operation was postponed Tuesday until December \u201cbecause of limited staff,\u201d said his mother, Tiffany Young. \u201cThat was really upsetting,\u201d she said, adding that the procedure would relieve her 17-month-old son\u2019s pain, help drain out liquid in his ears and reduce how often he would have to take antibiotics.   \u201cWe were talking about it all last week, this week, how we\u2019re looking forward to it, how we hope that it\u2019s going to make him feel so much better, and then just getting that call yesterday was so heartbreaking,\u201d said Young, 36. \u201cI know that it\u2019s considered minor, but to a parent, when your baby is suffering, it\u2019s super important,\" she added. In Modesto, John Schnaidt, 69, had an appointment scheduled Wednesday for his weekly dose of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, which is terminal. But Tuesday, he got a call from Kaiser telling him his session had been canceled, said his wife, Lisa Schnaidt. Appalled, the couple sought help from KOVR-TV of Sacramento, which helped reverse the cancellation \u2014 an outcome Lisa Schnaidt said many others did not get. \u201cWhat makes me sad is all these chairs that are empty right now,\" she said. \"I just know every time we\u2019ve been in here, it\u2019s busy. Almost every chair has been full, and I\u2019m looking at a lot of empty chairs right now.\u201d \"It's eerily quiet,\" she added. Lisa Schnaidt said the oncologist at the facility said tough decisions had to be made because of understaffing. \"The people that have a chance at a cure were left on the schedule, and the people who have a chance at possible surgery down the road were left on the schedule,\" she said the oncologist told her. \"Neither applies to my husband,\" she said. \"That tells me \u2018you\u2019re not worth it today.\u2019 I can understand it, but I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d In San Francisco, Alanna Darby, 33, had been waiting seven months for the next step in her gender-affirming care, facial feminization surgery. She learned Monday that her appointment, which was scheduled for Thursday, had been canceled.  \u201cI got a call from the scheduler that they had to cancel,\u201d Darby said, \u201cand they just didn\u2019t have any bookings open yet.\u201d She said not knowing when she will be able to have the surgery is difficult: \u201cWhat hurts is that, you know, I had something to look forward to and something that would make me feel more in my body.\u201d To prepare for the procedure, Darby had to stop hormone replacement therapy and could not shave her face. \u201cI\u2019ve been having mood swings and gender dysphoria, because, like, oh, the thing that makes me feel better in my body I can\u2019t do right now,\u201d she said. In a statement, Kaiser said it might have to \"reschedule certain non-urgent appointments and procedures, as long as that is appropriate and safe for the patient.\" A spokesperson denied that Kaiser canceled chemotherapy treatments for terminal cancer patients in Modesto but kept them for non-terminal cancer patients because of the strike. \"We recognize how important any appointment is to a patient, and we are committed to minimizing any disruption a strike can cause,\" the statement said. Kaiser would not say how many appointments were canceled or rescheduled. It serves nearly 13 million people nationwide, according to its website.  Many medical offices, departments and services in California were listed as closed on Kaiser's website during the days of the strike. Workers on strike include licensed vocational nurses; optometrists; behavioral health workers; pharmacists; emergency, radiology and surgical technicians; and people in hundreds of other roles, the union said. In an earlier statement, Kaiser said that management and union representatives are still at the bargaining table and that it remains committed to reaching a new agreement. It said that in anticipation of a strike, it put into place \"robust contingency plans\" to make sure patients were still served. It said that all hospitals and emergency departments will remain open and that many trained contract workers would help backfill striking employees. \"Our plans ensure that the urgent needs of our members and patients are the top priority,\" it said.

        "content": "Abercrombie & Fitch says it is investigating allegations that ex-CEO Mike Jeffries, who led the company for more than 20 years and defined its modern image, exploited men at sex parties he hosted. BBC News reported on Monday that 12 men described attending or organizing events that included sex acts for Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith. Some of those men said they were exploited or didn't participate willingly. Those events took place from 2009 to 2015, according to the BBC. Two of the men the BBC spoke to disclosed their identities on-the-record, and the BBC said it had confirmed key points of their stories by fact-checking emails, flight tickets and other documents as well as interviewing dozens of other people. It was not clear if any of the men had filed police reports. The BBC also reported that in the months before Jeffries left the company, a pension fund that had invested in Abercrombie & Fitch initiated a legal claim that the company had paid out settlements after allegations of \"misconduct\" by Jeffries. Brian Bieber, Jeffries\u2019 attorney, told NBC News that Jeffries would not comment on reports about his personal life. Smith did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement emailed to NBC News, a spokesperson for Abercrombie & Fitch said the company was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the allegations. It said that its current leadership and board were not aware of the allegations against Jeffries, and that it has engaged an outside law firm to investigate the issues raised by the BBC's reporting. Jeffries was CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch from 1992 to 2014. When he was hired, the company had recently emerged from bankruptcy and had a stodgy image. During his tenure, it became a much-imitated retailer that defined how younger people looked and dressed. It was also frequently criticized and repeatedly boycotted for sexualized ads and messages on its clothes. Later in Jeffries' tenure, the company fell behind rivals and newer fast fashion competitors. Its financial results also began to weaken, which hurt the company's stock. Jeffries lost his title as chairman following pressure from investors, and then left the company. Most of Abercrombie & Fitch's current management and board of directors joined after Jeffries left the company, although Fran Horowitz, who has been CEO since February 2017, was president of A&F's Hollister brand for the last two months of Jeffries' tenure.

        "content": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday touted his administration\u2019s efforts to address student debt, including an additional $9 billion in relief that the White House announced. The additional relief, set to help about 125,000 Americans, brings the Biden administration\u2019s total approved debt cancellation to $127 billion for nearly 3.6 million Americans, Biden said in remarks at the White House. \u201cThis kind of relief is life-changing for individuals and their families, but it\u2019s good for our economy as a whole as well. By freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student debt, it means they can go and get their lives in order,\u201d Biden said. The announcement comes just days after federal student loan repayments began again for the first time in over three years \u2014 the result of the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection in June of Biden\u2019s pandemic-era debt relief plan, which was aimed at canceling up to $20,000 in student debt for about 43 million eligible borrowers.  The newly approved $9 billion includes $5.2 billion in additional debt relief for 53,000 beneficiaries of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a White House statement said. The new funds also include nearly $2.8 billion for about 51,000 borrowers on income-based repayment plans who made 20 years or more on payments, but \u201cnever got the relief they were entitled to,\u201d the release said.  Another $1.2 billion will go to an estimated 22,000 borrowers who have a total or permanent disability, the statement said.  \u201cPresident Biden has long believed that college should be a ticket to the middle class, not a burden that weighs on families,\u201d the White House statement said. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to invalidate Biden\u2019s plan, which would have eliminated more than $400 billion in student debt, the president implemented alternate measures to try to chip away at the nationwide debt.  In June, Biden announced that borrowers would have the ability to enroll in a temporary 12-month \u201conramp repayment program\u201d that would remove the threat of default or harm to borrowers\u2019 credit. He also stated that borrowers would not need to use more than 5% of their discretionary income to pay undergraduate loans, down from a previous cap of 10%. \u201cAs I said at the time, I believe the court\u2019s decision to strike down my student debt relief program was wrong. But I promised I wouldn\u2019t give up,\u201d Biden said during his remarks Wednesday.  \u201cMy administration will continue to use every tool at our disposal to help ease the burden of student debt, so more Americans can be free to achieve their dreams,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s good for our economy.

        "title": "Striking Kaiser Permanente workers say patients and employees are suffering amid staffing shortages",
        "content": "AURORA, Colorado \u2014 From coast to coast Wednesday, more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers picketed outside of health care facilities, arguing that staffing shortages have reached crisis levels for employees and patients alike. The strike, which the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions has said is the largest work stoppage of health care workers in U.S. history, was on display from California to Virginia, with workers walking out at 6 a.m. local time.  The striking workers include a wide array of professionals, including vocational nurses, ultrasound sonographers, respiratory therapists, emergency department technicians, housekeepers and more. The majority of striking workers were in California, according to a representative: 60,000 from the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and an additional 5,000 from the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 30 in San Diego.  In Sacramento just before 7:30 a.m. PT, striking workers lined the street outside of a medical center, holding signs that read \u201cKaiser workers won\u2019t be silenced\u201d and \u201cRespect and value health care workers.\u201d Some shook tambourines, rang yellow bells or banged on pots. Many drivers honked in support as they passed by. On the other side of  the country, outside of the Kaiser Permanente Springfield Medical Center in Springfield, Virginia, workers chanted, \u201cHey Kaiser, come on out, we\u2019ve got something to talk about!\u201d Some were dressed in white coats as they marched. Sarah Levesque, the secretary-treasurer for OPEIU Local 2, told NBC News\u2019 Tom Costello that workers were \u201clooking for Kaiser executives to come to the table and bargain in good faith over the short-staffing crisis.\u201d She said there were about 180 optometrists and pharmacists striking in Springfield. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the staff to adequately take care of our patients,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cThese people got into health care because they wanted to take care of patients and they\u2019re just stretched too thin. It\u2019s taking up to three months to get appointments with some of the doctors.\u201d David Hawa, an ambulatory care pharmacist in Springfield, echoed those concerns. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough pharmacists to deliver the health care needed for our patients,\u201d he said.   The result of that, he said, is \u201clonger lines, cancellation of appointments. frustrated customers on the phone or in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the best we can do, and it\u2019s not fair for our patients,\u201d he said. The same sentiment prompted workers to strike in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed and patients have to wait more than a month to be seen,\u201d said Lorena Jackson, who works in scheduling in primary care. \u201cBy then, you\u2019re either feeling better, dead or you have to pay more money out-of-pocket to visit urgent care.\u201d Employees said they were also protesting for more wages in light of skyrocketing housing prices in Colorado. \u201cThe price of living is too high and these companies need to start paying accordingly,\u201d said Lavette Clardy, who also works in scheduling and is a labor union member with SEIU Local 105. \u201cPeople are here risking their lives and can\u2019t afford a work-life balance and enjoy their families.\u201d  Based in Oakland, California, Kaiser Permanente is a nonprofit health system that serves nearly 13 million people in its 39 hospitals and more than 600 medical facilities nationwide, according to its website. The health care worker strike comes amid a swell of recent work stoppages across various professions, including autoworkers and the entertainment industry. The strike, set to last up to three days in some areas of the country, came after labor negotiators and Kaiser Permanente failed to reach a new contract deal before the previous agreement expired on Saturday. Talks are ongoing, according to a spokesperson for Kaiser Permanente, who said in a statement after the strike began that \u201cthere has been a lot of progress, with agreements reached on several specific proposals late Tuesday.\u201d The spokesperson added that hospitals, emergency rooms and pharmacies would remain open during the walkout. The strike began in Washington, D.C., and Virginia at 6 a.m. ET before expanding to Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. The coalition said workers were taking action to \u201cprotest Kaiser executives\u2019 bad faith bargaining, which is getting in the way of finding solutions to solve the Kaiser short-staffing crisis by investing in its workforce.\u201d Elizabeth Chuck reported from New York.

        "title": "More than 75,000 workers to strike at hundreds of Kaiser Permanente health facilities across U.S.",
        "content": "Workers at Kaiser Permanente \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest health care nonprofit organization \u2014 began a strike Wednesday morning that is set to within hours see more than 75,000 union members walk out of hospitals and medical offices after the company and labor negotiators failed to resolve a dispute over staffing levels. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions has described the work stoppage as the largest strike of health care workers in U.S. history. The strike will target Kaiser hospitals and medical offices serving California, Colorado, Oregon, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Washington state. The strike began at 6 a.m. ET in D.C. and Virginia. Other workers will be scheduled to walk out at 6 a.m. local time in the remaining states. The striking workers include vocational nurses, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, X-ray technicians, respiratory therapists, medical assistants, pharmacists and hundreds of other positions. Kaiser Permanente serves nearly 13 million patients and operates 39 hospitals and more than 600 medical offices across eight states and the District of Columbia. Kaiser said it has contingency plans to ensure patients continue to receive care during a strike. The strike by Kaiser Permanente employees is the latest action by organized labor this year as inflation and a workforce shortage have brought tensions over pay, benefits and staffing to a boiling point. More than 25,000 members of the United Auto Workers are currently on strike against Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis. Hollywood writers staged a 150-day walkout that came to an end last week after they secured a pay increase and improved benefits. The unions at Kaiser are demanding long-term investments to address a staffing shortage in addition to better pay and benefits. Caroline Lucas, executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, said the staffing crisis has led to unsafe working conditions and deteriorating care for patients. \u201cWe continue to have front-line health care workers who are burnt out and stretched to the max and leaving the industry,\u201d Lucas told CNBC. \u201cWe have folks getting injured on the job because they\u2019re trying to do too much and see too many people and work too quickly. It\u2019s not a sustainable situation.\u201d Hospitals have long struggled to retain staff because workers tend to leave the low pay and the high stress of the health care field when unemployment is low, according to Patricia Pittman, an expert at the Milken Institute School of Public Health. The devastating toll of the covid pandemic has compounded the staffing shortage, Pittman said. Many workers left the field because they felt the administration was not doing enough to protect them from both the virus and antagonism from some members of the community, she said. \u201cThe health care workers lived through a period of tremendous fear and uncertainty about themselves, their families, and often did not feel supported by the administration and often did not feel supported by the community,\u201d Pittman said. Kaiser Permanente this week acknowledged the stress that health care workers are facing. More than 5 million people have left their health care jobs and burnout is at a record high, the company said in a statement Monday. Kaiser said it is committed to a fair and equitable agreement. But the union coalition said management failed to adequately address workers\u2019 concerns about unsafe staffing levels. The three-day strike is a protest against Kaiser executives\u2019 \u201cbad faith bargaining,\u201d the coalition said in a statement Tuesday. Kaiser reported a profit of $2 billion in the second quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.2 billion. The nonprofit generated $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter. ",

        "title": "Donations have surged to groups linked to conservative Project 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, stepped up efforts to boost its Project 2025 initiative by ramping up grants to the venture aimed at creating a \u201cgovernment-in-waiting\u201d for the next Republican presidential administration, according to a new tax filing. The foundation distributed over $1.67 million in grants in 2022 \u2014 including a total of $965,000 to organizations on the advisory board of Project 2025, tax records show. These donations accounted for 58% of Heritage\u2019s total grant-making in 2022. It also distributed $400,000 to its political arm, Heritage Action for America. By comparison, in 2021, the foundation contributed only $174,000 to other nonprofit organizations. In 2022, contributions to the Heritage Foundation also increased, to $95 million, a jump of 26% compared to the previous year. The filing was first shared with NBC News by Accountable.US, a progressive advocacy group. The Project 2025 initiative aims to be ready with conservative policy recommendations when the party retakes the White House. The group is also vetting and training personnel who could populate a future administration. The advisory board for Project 2025 includes representatives from conservative groups led by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, as well as heavyweight mainstays, like the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, which received $100,000 last year. The board forms a diverse coalition that also includes the free-market FreedomWorks and Competitive Enterprise Institute, and those that represent the ascendant populism that came into favor under President Donald Trump, such as American Compass, the Coalition for a Prosperous America and American Moment, a group focused on identifying and preparing young staffers to serve in political roles in government. Earlier this year, Heritage scored a top aide from the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit group closely tied to Trump that is also preparing to staff a future GOP administration. While these groups can\u2019t support a candidate outright, many of the people leading them or with longtime affiliations have close ties to Trump, having served in his administration, and some could be expected to retain his ear. For instance, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and senior economic contributor at FreedomWorks and distinguished fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, is one of several advisers to Trump on economic issues going back years. Others include Larry Kudlow, the Fox Business host and former director of the National Economic Council under Trump, and Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Trump White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich is also advising Trump. Whether Republicans have control of Congress could add another wrinkle to a new GOP administration's planning efforts, Moore told NBC News. \u201cIf Trump comes in, a lot of this will be by government diktat \u2014 White House diktat,\u201d Moore said, recalling Barack Obama\u2019s strategy of taking executive and administrative actions that the former president summarized as, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d Stephen Miller, a former Trump White House adviser who now runs America First Legal, and Russ Vought, who also served as a top aide to Trump and is now leading the Center for Renewing America, are two figures expected to play prominent advisory roles to Project 2025. In a statement to NBC News, Heritage Foundation Chief Advancement Officer Andy Olivastro said spending by the organization is focused on building the conservative movement through a range of investments. \u201cHeritage is proud of our significant investments with conservative organizations across the country every year,\u201d Olivastro said. \"These take the form of sponsorships, partnerships, coalitions, and our new Innovation Prizes. Everything aligns with our policy priorities and shows the depth and breadth as well as increasing size and scale of the conservative movement.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are in the fight of our lives, and the American people know they can always trust Heritage to be on offense.\u201d Project 2025\u2019s board of more than 80 conservative organizations includes nearly 40 that have received funding from dark-money groups linked to Leonard Leo, a major right-wing donor who influenced the shaping of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative supermajority under Trump. Leo was a key outside adviser to Trump on his judicial picks while he was in office, though their relationship has soured in recent years, The New York Times recently reported. A prolific fundraiser, Leo is affiliated with an extensive network of tax-exempt groups, including DonorsTrust, a donor-advised nonprofit that directs money to other organizations and groups seeking to influence policy, such as the 85 Fund or the Concord Fund. The flow of donor money may show where influence has pooled. In 2022, DonorsTrust alone funneled more than $16.5 million to organizations on Project 2025\u2019s advisory board, according to the group\u2019s 990 tax filing. One of those groups, the Teneo Network \u2014 described as a \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d for the conservative movement spanning business, media, finance, entertainment and politics \u2014 received one of the highest distributions, more than $3 million. The $16.5 million in donations represented a small increase from one year prior, when groups that are now part of the Project 2025 advisory board received about $15 million collectively from DonorsTrust in the 2021 financial year. Project 2025 was started in 2022 after the arrival of Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts. Caroline Ciccone, president of Accountable.US, warned that Project 2025 threatens to empower an executive branch set on weaponizing its powers against its political enemies, while dismantling core government accountability functions, with the Heritage Foundation and DonorsTrust enabling its efforts. \u201cProject 2025 is a five-alarm fire for our democracy \u2014 and groups like the Heritage Foundation and Leonard Leo-backed DonorsTrust are making it all possible by dumping millions into the dangerous project,\u201d Ciccone said. \u201cFrom dismantling critical checks and balances to weaponizing the executive branch, Project 2025 takes extremism to a whole new level. The project \u2014 and the dark network propping it up \u2014 must be stopped.\u201d Accountable.US, which describes itself as a watchdog group, has received more than $11 million in recent years from the New Venture Fund, a liberal dark-money behemoth that has controlled a war chest of close to a billion dollars in recent years, tax records show. It received more than $2 million in 2022 from New Venture Fund, according to its most recent 990 tax filing. The New Venture Fund spent more than $500 million in 2022 alone, the most recent year that its tax filing is publicly available. While the Heritage Foundation has received a funding boost, groups tied to Leo collectively received far less than in previous years, tax filings reported by Bloomberg show. By comparison, Miller\u2019s America First Legal raised more than $44 million last year, according to tax documents, with more than half appearing to come from a single donor. The group has seen a considerable increase in funding from the nearly $6.4 million it raised in 2021. In 2014, before Trump had even declared his candidacy, Heritage was assembling a database of potential staffers for a future administration, reprising planning efforts that date back decades. Yet while preparations to hit the ground running in a new administration are not new, Trump\u2019s promises to use his powers to go after his perceived enemies have stoked concern among even allies. \u201cHe\u2019s taking names. That\u2019s scary to anyone who has a rational mind, who is a free thinker, who doesn\u2019t believe in this kind of fealty,\u201d said a former Trump campaign adviser. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking people to take out their political enemies.\u201d  This person said the topic had come up again and again in conversations with people who intend to support the former president\u2019s re-election campaign but are also wary of elevating a leader who has strongly personalized his political fights. In the early race for the presidency, Trump has already vowed to appoint a special prosecutor \u201cto go after\u201d President Joe Biden and his family. Trump has also threatened to \u201croot out\u201d his own enemies, whom he described last week as \u201cvermin.\u201d \u201cThese are private conversations where we share a concern that if we are not 100 % bowing to Trump, saying the right things, fighting for him, or denouncing his enemies, there are going to be consequences for you and your family and your professional status,\u201d this person said. If elected, Trump has said he plans to respond in kind to a government that he perceives as working to stop him from returning to office. His allies are also ramping up their fight against what they have described as \u201cactivist\u201d judges and prosecutors who have charged Trump, including in a new advertisement. Aides to Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement this week appearing to distance him from outside groups aimed at shaping a presidential transition, which have garnered outsize interest as the former president leads the GOP primary by double digits in polls. Still, Trump faces a series of legal battles as he heads into next year\u2019s primary season, with a packed schedule that pits the start of the trial in his election interference case up against Super Tuesday.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican-led House committee on Friday began posting internal video from the Jan. 6 riot to a public website, with House Speaker Mike Johnson vowing to make the footage \"available to all Americans.\" \u201cToday, we will begin immediately posting video on a public website and move as quickly as possible to add to the website nearly all of the footage, more than 40,000 hours,\" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will provide millions of Americans, criminal defendants, public interest organizations, and the media an ability to see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials,\" he said, adding that requests for access to specific videos can also be made through the House Administration Committee. The panel began by posting 90 hours of security video that had already been released to media outlets. Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, blasted Friday's release of the footage. \u201cIt is unconscionable that one of Speaker Johnson\u2019s first official acts as steward of the institution is to endanger his colleagues, staff, visitors, and our country by allowing virtually unfettered access to sensitive Capitol security footage,\" Morelle said in a statement. \"That he is doing so over the strenuous objections of the security professionals within the Capitol Police is outrageous.\" Capitol Police declined to comment. According to a senior congressional aide, and staff will be working to review, clear and release footage that does not compromise security on a rolling basis. The 40,000 hours of video is expected to be made public \u201cover the next few months,\u201d the aide said, noting that footage that doxes, or harasses private individuals will not be posted. Johnson's announcement comes months after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., provided exclusive access to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson to security video from the Jan. 6 attack. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, the chairman of the Administration Committee's oversight subcommittee, said in September that security video from the Jan. 6 riot would be made available at terminals to representatives of U.S. news outlets, \"qualifying\" non-profit organizations, Jan. 6 defendants and others. Loudermilk has been critical of the now-defunct House Jan. 6 committee, which released surveillance footage last year that showed Loudermilk giving a tour of the Capitol on Jan. 5.

        "title": "Georgia prosecutor in Trump election case requests August start date for trial",
        "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on Friday requested an Aug. 5 start date for the trial of former President Donald Trump and his allied co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case. \u201cThis proposed trial date balances potential delays from Defendant Trump\u2019s other criminal trials...and the other Defendants\u2019 constitutional speedy trial rights,\u201d Willis said in a court filing. Trump's lawyers said they opposed the proposed start date. Trump attorneys Steven Sadow and Jennifer Little wrote in their court filing that the former president \"requests the opportunity to present oral argument in opposition to the motion at a hearing to be held at a time convenient to the Court.\" The Fulton County District Attorney's office declined to comment. Trump has repeatedly pushed to have his various trial dates postponed until after the 2024 election. In explaining her rationale for starting the trial in early August, Willis pointed to Trump\u2019s federal election interference trial in Washington, D.C., that's slated to begin in March and his classified documents trial in Florida that's expected to get underway in May. Starting the Georgia trial in August, she said, would mean the case is \u201cunlikely to be subject to delay or interference from these other trials.\u201d She added that starting in August would also \u201cshow deference for each Defendant\u2019s constitutional speedy trial rights\u201d by holding the trial within one year of the indictments, which were released on Aug. 14, 2023. In a statement Friday, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung argued that the proposed Aug. 5 start date request was \"proof\" that \"Biden knows he can't beat President Trump.\" \"Radical Democrat Fani Willis has again proven that her case is purely political, designed to interfere with President Trump\u2019s re-election by demanding a trial date in the most vital time in President Trump\u2019s winning campaign,\" Cheung said. In her filing, Willis also asked that the judge, Scott McAfee, set the deadline for negotiated guilty pleas for June 21. She said her office will consider guilty pleas for the remaining defendants until that date. Willis further asked that McAfee not consider any motions to sever defendants until after the guilty plea deadline. Nineteen defendants were charged in August. Four have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. Willis argued that the remaining defendants should be tried together, citing other organized crime trials Fulton County prosecuted with multiple defendants. \u201cThe State clearly retains the logistical and prosecutorial capabilities to try all of the remaining Defendants together,\u201d she said in the filing. The defendants have been charged with violating Georgia\u2019s RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization) act. The indictments stemmed from an investigation into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Charlie Gile and Blayne Alexander reported from Atlanta, Megan Lebowitz from Washington.

        "title": "White House counsel demands House Republicans withdraw Biden family subpoenas",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is hitting back against House Republicans and their impeachment inquiry into the president by demanding that GOP lawmakers withdraw their subpoenas targeting Biden family members and administration officials. In a letter obtained by NBC News, White House counsel Richard Sauber called the requests for information and interviews \u201cunjustified,\u201d and characterized the overall impeachment inquiry as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d The letter, dated Friday, was addressed to House Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \u201cYour latest steps follow an irresponsible set of subpoenas and requests for interviews that you launched last week, directed to multiple members of the President\u2019s family, all of whom are private citizens, including for example the President\u2019s deceased son\u2019s widow and her sister,\u201d Sauber wrote. \u201cThese unjustified requests were sent despite the fact that, after a year of investigating, voluminous records and testimony from dozens of witnesses have refuted your baseless allegations about the President.\u201d Comer has released a long list of subpoenas and requests for interviews and documents focused on several Biden family members and their associates. Included in the group are the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, brother James Biden, his daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen and the widow of his deceased son Beau, Hallie Biden. Sauber described the requests of information from the private citizens as an example of weaponizing the power of Congress to attack a political opponent. The subpoenas of Biden family members came after House Republicans obtained thousands of pages of bank records connected to James and Hunter Biden. They released details on two interest-free loans from the president to his brother that were repaid in full during the period when Biden was not in office. Comer suggested that the loan arrangement was part of a suspicious business deal involving James Biden, but did not provide definitive documentation to back up that claim. The status of the impeachment inquiry and whether it leads to articles of impeachment remains an open question. Speaker Mike Johnson, who as a rank-and-file member of Congress was very critical of the Biden family's business practices, has taken a more muted approach to the probe since taking the gavel. He has described impeachment as one of the \u201cheaviest powers\u201d that members of Congress have at their disposal and promised that he would not predetermine the outcome, preferring instead to see where the evidence leads. Johnson's approach has led some conservative members of the House GOP caucus to raise concerns about where he stands while publicly pushing for Republicans to be more aggressive in their inquiry. Johnson huddled with the Comer, Jordan and House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., this week to get an update on the status of the inquiry and subsequently released a statement signaling the investigation was moving toward conclusion. \u201cAt this stage, our impeachment inquiry has already shown the corrupt conduct of the President\u2019s family, and that he and White House officials have repeatedly lied about his knowledge and involvement in his family\u2019s business activities,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. He went on to say, \u201cI commend the good work of Chairmen Comer, Jordan, and Smith. As we move forward toward an inflection point in this critical investigation, they have my full and unwavering support.\u201d In his letter Friday, Sauber argued that the impeachment inquiry was without merit. \u201cRather than acknowledge the insufficiency of the evidence, you have consistently misrepresented the documents and testimony you have received and then moved the goalposts when your claims have been debunked, as you appear to be doing here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis pattern of distortions and falsehoods lays bare that no amount of truthful testimony or document productions will satisfy you and exposes the improper nature of your Committees\u2019 efforts.\u201d Sauber also criticized the fact that the impeachment inquiry was launched without a vote on the House floor. \u201cYou also claim the mantle of an 'impeachment inquiry' knowing full well that the Constitution requires that the full House authorize an impeachment inquiry before a committee may utilize compulsory process pursuant to the impeachment power\u2014a step the Republican House Majority has so far refused to take,\u201d he wrote. It is unlikely that Sauber\u2019s call to withdraw the subpoenas will lead to a different course of action by the GOP-led committees. In a statement to NBC News, Comer accused the president of lying and demanded more information. \u201cIf President Biden has nothing to hide, then he should make his current and former staff available to testify before Congress about his mishandling of classified documents,\" Comer said. \"President Biden and this White House are seeking to obstruct our investigation at every turn,\" he added. \"We are not deterred by this obstruction and will continue to follow the facts and hold President Biden accountable to the American people.\u201d As it stands, Hunter Biden is scheduled to participate in a closed-door transcribed interview on Dec. 13, a week after James Biden has been asked to appear.

        "title": "Judge in Trump election interference case won't strike Jan. 6 references from indictment",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has rejected former President Donald Trump's request to strike references to the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, from his federal election interference indictment in a case that is set to go to trial in just over three months. Trump sought to have certain passages struck from the indictment, which was returned in August, on the grounds that they would inflame the jury and create bias against him even though he has not been charged with any crimes of violence.  But U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote in an order Friday that there was no risk of the indictment creating bias with the jurors because they will not be getting a copy of the actual indictment to refer to during deliberations. The jury selection process will be able to weed out any potential jurors who have already read the indictment and been exposed to the references to violence, she added. \"Regardless of whether the allegations at issue are relevant, Defendant has not satisfied his burden to clearly show that they are prejudicial,\" Chutkan wrote. Trump's motion, she wrote, makes \"numerous inflammatory and unsupported accusations\" and \"devotes only a single paragraph to the prejudice requirement,\" in which the former president claims the jury pool has been \"exposed to the Indictment and its inflammatory and prejudicial allegations, through media coverage relating to the case.\u201d But Trump's motion \"fails to cite even one example of that evidence,\" she wrote. \"In any event, the voir dire process will allow the court to examine and address the effects that pretrial publicity, including any generated by Defendant, has had on the impartiality of potential jurors,\" Chutkan wrote. \"When trial begins, the court will also take steps to screen from the jury any irrelevant and prejudicial material that either party seeks to introduce. Moreover, before the jurors deliberate, the court will instruct them on the actual charges and the evidence they may consider in their deliberations.\" In its filing, Trump's legal team argued, \u201cBecause the Government has not charged President Trump with responsibility for the actions at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, allegations related to these actions are not relevant and are prejudicial and inflammatory.\u201d In a supplemental filing, Trump\u2019s team argued that \u201cnot a shred of evidence suggests President Trump called for any violence or asked anyone to enter the Capitol unlawfully.\u201d A Trump lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Chutkan's ruling. The judge's ruling comes as a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments Monday about a limited gag order that Chutkan imposed on Trump in the election interference trial, one of four criminal cases that the leading Republican presidential candidate is facing and one of two federal cases brought forward by special counsel Jack Smith. The gag order was temporarily paused until the appeals court hearing. More than 1,200 people have been charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol, and online sleuths who have aided cases against hundreds of the rioters say that about 1,000 additional participants have been identified but not yet arrested. Trump's trial is scheduled to begin March 4, 2024. The former president has pleaded not guilty. Daniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington. Ryan J.

        "title": "White House condemns Elon Musk post to X that supported antisemitic claim",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House on Friday condemned a post Elon Musk made on X that embraced an antisemitic claim by another account that accused Jews of pushing hatred against white people. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. \"We all have a responsibility to bring people together against hate, and an obligation to speak out against anyone who attacks the dignity of their fellow Americans and compromises the safety of our communities.\" On Wednesday, a user posted to X accusations that Jews push hatred of white people, saying he was \"deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest s--- now about western Jewish populations,\" realizing that \"minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much.\" Musk replied to the post, \"You have said the actual truth.\" His post garnered more than 6 million views, according to the site-provided statistics. Later in the thread, Musk targeted the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that fights antisemitism. \"The ADL unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel,\" Musk wrote. \"This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.\" Musk has criticized the ADL in the past, too. Following Musk's initial tweet agreeing with the antisemitic claim, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the ADL, called out the danger of promoting antisemitic theories. \"At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one\u2019s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories,\" Greenblatt posted to X with a screenshot of Musk's post. In the White House's response to Musk's post, Bates said it was \"unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of Antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. \"Like President Biden said weeks ago memorializing the victims of the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting, the October 7 'devastating atrocity has brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of Antisemitism;' and under his presidency 'we will continue to condemn Antisemitism at every turn,\" Bates continued. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018 left 11 killed and seven injured, and was the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. Reached for comment by NBC News, X responded, \"Busy now, please check back later.\" On Thursday, Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, posted that the platform has been \"extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.\" \"There\u2019s no place for it anywhere in the world \u2014 it\u2019s ugly and wrong,\" the post continued. \"Full stop.\" Biden has also addressed the rise in antisemitism in recent weeks, and many American Jews have said they approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. \"We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism,\" Biden said in an Oct. 20 speech. \"We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.\" Since Oct. 7, Jews have experienced a dramatic rise in antisemitism. In the month since the attacks, there has been a 316% increase in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2022, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights and advocacy group, said last month that it got nearly 800 requests for help and reports of bias incidents from Muslims across the U.S. from Oct. 7 to Oct. 24, a 182% jump from any 16-day stretch in 2022.

        "title": "Biden to discuss migration with Mexico's president during Friday meeting",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 President Joe Biden will hold a meeting with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Friday, kicking off his last day in San Francisco for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. The leaders will discuss \"how we can continue to work together as partners to manage migration at our shared border and mobilize a hemispheric-wide response to this challenge,\" according to a statement from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announcing the meeting. Ahead of their bilateral meeting, Biden thanked the Mexican president for previous efforts to address migration, pointing to their joint efforts in enforcing borders and opening legal pathways for migrants. \"I want to thank you, Mr. President, and your team, I really mean it, for the cooperation and your leadership in taking on this challenge. I know it's not easy,\" Biden said alongside L\u00f3pez Obrador in remarks to the press L\u00f3pez Obrador thanked Biden for his work on opening legal pathways for migration. \"I would also like to express and to state that he is the first president in the United States in recent times who has not built walls,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador added through an interpreter, in an apparent reference to former President Donald Trump. (The Biden administration has, however, waived federal laws to permit more border wall construction in Texas.) Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador met in Mexico City in January, where they discussed counternarcotic efforts, economic integration, climate commitments and \"irregular migration,\" according to a White House. \"Their meeting builds upon 200 years of bilateral relations between the United States and Mexico, an enduring partnership that reflects our shared values and the cultural and familial bonds between our two countries,\" the White House said. The meeting between Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador \u201cis obviously going to be dominated by the one issue that has dominated U.S. diplomatic bandwidth with Mexico during the Biden administration, which is how to contain migration flows to the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the U.S. Republicans have long criticized Biden's \u2014 and Democrats' \u2014 stances on the U.S.-Mexico border. But Friday's meeting comes as Biden has also faced criticism from Democratic leaders, who say they need more help from the federal government on handling an influx of migrants to their states or cities. \"As just one state in our union, we cannot lead coordination efforts at the border,\" said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker in an October letter to Biden. \"It is time for the federal government to take a much more active role in managing the transport and destination of the transport of asylum seekers.\" The reason the border issue looms so large, Sarukhan said, is because \u201call roads to the Republican presidential nomination lead through the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d In September, the administration extended temporary protected status to more Venezuelan migrants, which allowed about 200,000 migrants to get work authorization. The White House also provided 800 additional active-duty personnel to support border efforts, the Department of Homeland Security said. The White House has repeatedly called on Congress to enact immigration reform. \"As a result of Congress\u2019 failure to enact the reform, the Administration has been using the limited tools it has available to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system while leading the largest expansion of lawful pathways for immigration in decades,\" a Homeland Security fact sheet from September said. If Biden can point to a relatively stable dynamic on the U.S.-Mexico border, \"particularly in the home stretch in the late spring and summer of next year, that will be a boon to President Biden\u2019s electoral narrative going into November,\" Sarukhan said. Friday caps off a string of meetings between Biden and foreign leaders this week, notably including Chinese President Xi Jinping, which ended a yearlong communications drought between the two leaders. Later on Friday following the president\u2019s meeting with L\u00f3pez Obrador, Biden will host an APEC Leaders Retreat and transfer the chair position to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, according to the White House schedule. Biden will then travel to Wilmington, Delaware, where he will spend the weekend. Peter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News. Megan Lebowitz is based in the Washington bureau.

        "title": "Education Department opens probes into alleged antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents at universities",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights opened investigations this week into alleged antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents at a half-dozen U.S. colleges and universities and a local school district. The schools include Cornell University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Lafayette College, Wellesley College, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and the Maize Unified School District in Kansas. Five of the complaints received involving the schools allege antisemitic harassment and two allege anti-Muslim harassment, according to the Education Department. The department did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for additional details. The schools are being investigated for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, the department said. \"All colleges, and universities and K-12 schools receiving federal funds must comply with Title VI,\" the department said in a release detailing the investigations. \"Schools that violate the law and refuse to address the problems identified by OCR can ultimately lose federal funding or be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for further action.\" The department said the investigation into the allegations are part of the Biden administration's efforts \"to address the alarming nationwide rise in reports of antisemitism, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and other forms of discrimination and harassment on college campuses and in K-12 schools since the October 7 Israel-Hamas conflict.\" Asked for further details on the alleged incidents under investigation, the department said it could not comment on an ongoing investigation. Since Hamas' terrorist attack Oct. 7, a number of incidents have been reported at U.S. schools. Federal officials, for example, charged a Cornell University student with allegedly posting threats of violence against Jewish students in an online forum on campus in Ithaca, New York. The University of Pennsylvania recently alerted the FBI to \u201cvile, disturbing antisemitic emails\u201d threatening violence against the Jewish community on the Philadelphia campus. Lafayette College's assistant vice president for communications and marketing, Scott Morse, said the college received a notification about the complaint Thursday morning, but school officials \"do not know why\" the college was included in the investigation. He said students of differing views held a peaceful gathering on campus recently to honor those who have died in the conflict in the Middle East, but added that the school will cooperate fully with the investigation. Columbia University declined to comment on the investigation, but spokesman Ben Chang noted that it has taken various actions in the last month to address the issue, including the president forming a task force on antisemitism. Cornell University also declined to comment. The executive director of communications for the Maize school district, Lori O'Toole Buselt, said that it was notified that it's under investigation but said a copy of the complaint was not provided, so it couldn't comment further. The University of Pennsylvania said in a statement that it is taking \u201cclear and comprehensive action to prevent, address, and respond to antisemitism.\u201d Wellesley said in a statement that the incidents being investigated involved student leaders in a residence hall, which it said it responded to. The complaint also included allegations about a teach-in in which several faculty shared historical context and perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with students.  Cooper Union did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington. ",

The resolution comes a day after the committee released a scathing report that concluded there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d Santos \u201cviolated federal criminal laws,\u201d including using campaign funds for personal purposes and filing false campaign reports. \u201cThe evidence uncovered in the Ethics Committee\u2019s Investigative Subcommittee investigation is more than sufficient to warrant punishment and the most appropriate punishment, is expulsion,\u201d Guest said in a statement Friday. \u201cSo, separate from the Committee process and my role as Chairman, I have filed an expulsion resolution.\u201d Santos is \"not fit to serve as a Member of the United States House of Representatives\" because of \"his egregious violations,\" the resolution said. The earliest a vote on the expulsion can be held would be the week after Thanksgiving. The House returns Nov. 28. Santos' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the expulsion resolution. After the release of the Ethics report, Santos announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election next year. The Ethics panel found a number of suspicious campaign expenditures it said did not appear to have a \u201ccampaign nexus,\" according to the report. The committee's report detailed spending by Santos at Herm\u00e8s and Ferragamo stores and on an Airbnb while he was on a Hamptons weekend getaway, Botox treatments and OnlyFans, a subscription-based site often used to host pornography. Earlier this month, Santos survived an effort to expel him from Congress: While 179 members voted in favor of expulsion, 213 voted against and 19 voted present. Two-thirds of lawmakers are needed to remove a member from the House. Lawmakers had said that they wanted to wait for the Ethics Committee to release its report on its investigation into Santos.

        "content": "Attorneys for a group of Michigan activists are asking the state Supreme Court to hear an appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that would allow former President Donald Trump\u2019s name on the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot. Filings late Thursday afternoon seek an \u201cimmediate and expedited consideration\u201d for appeal and an \u201cemergency application\u201d to bypass the state Appeals Court. The Supreme Court is asked to render a decision by Dec. 1, a reversal of the lower court\u2019s ruling and remanding the lower court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Trump\u2019s eligibility to be placed on the primary ballot. \u201cIt is a virtual certainty that any decision by the Court of Appeals will be appealed to this court by the party that does not prevail,\u201d the filing read. \u201cBut with the pressing need to finalize and print the ballots for the presidential primary election, there is not time for considered decisions from both the Court of Appeals and this court. Time is therefore of the essence in this election case.\u201d The liberal group Free Speech for People had sued to force Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to bar Trump from the ballot. They pointed to a section of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment that prohibits a person from running for federal office if they have engaged in insurrection. But Court of Claims Judge James Redford rejected their arguments that Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol meant the court had to declare him ineligible for the presidency. Redford said in an order released Tuesday that it was the proper role of Congress to decide the question. A Trump campaign spokesman said Tuesday that the cases are an attempt to \u201cdeny the American people the right to choose their next president.\u201d Dozens of cases hoping to keep Trump\u2019s name off ballots have been filed. Most have been filed by individual citizens acting alone. But the Michigan case, one in Colorado and another in Minnesota are supported by liberal groups with deeper pockets and better resources.

        "title": "Supreme Court decision leaves family of a man killed at the border searching for justice",
        "content": "TOHONO O\u2019ODHAM NATION, Ariz. \u2014 It was a dark and chaotic scene in the Arizona desert the night 58-year-old Raymond Mattia died from nine bullet wounds after three Border Patrol agents fired dozens of rounds at him. Brandishing flashlights and handguns, 10 Border Patrol agents were responding to a call that shots had been fired about a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border. As they walked through patches of cacti, Mattia stood shrouded in darkness steps from his home holding something in his hands. \u201cPut it down for me. Put it down,\u201d one of the agents shouted, according to shaky bodycam footage of the incident. The Untouchables: NBC News investigates how federal law enforcement officials are able to harm people with little to no accountability. Mattia complied, tossing a sheathed machete to the ground. \u201cPut your hands out of your f------ pocket.\u201d  Mattia fumbled with the pocket of his green jacket. He appeared to toss an object aside. Almost simultaneously, three agents opened fire. Less than 30 seconds after the agents first spoke to him, Mattia slumped to the ground. A cellphone, not a firearm, lay on the ground.   His sister Annette Mattia, 61, was just yards away in her own house the night of May 18. Five months later, she choked down tears while standing near the spot where he lay. \u201cThis is where he lived, and it just is sadness and anger because it didn\u2019t have to happen at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they would have talked to him it would have turned out a lot different because you know he wasn\u2019t a threat.\u201d  \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die like this,\u201d her daughter Yvonne Nevarez, 43, added. Now, the family wants justice.  \u201cTo me it feels like there are still murderers walking around. Who knows they might be back out here again? Who knows what they might do to anyone else?\u201d Annette Mattia said in an interview outside her home. The family, several of whom live on a compound in Menagers Dam Village within the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, believe that the agents ruthlessly gunned a man down with scant regard for his constitutional rights. But federal prosecutors have already said there will be no criminal charges.  A recent Supreme Court ruling means any effort to sue the agents individually for alleged constitutional violations is doomed to fail. The 2022 ruling is one in a line of cases that has decimated the ability of victims to file lawsuits, known as \u201cBivens claims,\u201d accusing Border Patrol agents of using excessive force or other constitutional violations. The court's dismantling of Bivens has reverberated throughout the federal government and touched nearly every agency, but Border Patrol represents a large fraction of armed federal law enforcement NBC News found that the ruling has also made it more difficult to sue agents in other federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The geography of the Border Patrol\u2019s jurisdiction presents a uniquely thorny set of legal questions. The court, in a case called Egbert v. Boule that involved a claim against a Border Patrol agent, introduced a new legal test that makes it virtually impossible to bring a wide range of claims against federal officials. And so the Mattia family is far from alone. In the aftermath of the ruling, lawsuits alleging a wide range of constitutional violations are now routinely tossed out. People mistreated by federal officials aren\u2019t getting their day in court, instead being denied the chance to find out if a jury would agree that their constitutional rights were violated. The court has also made it harder to sue government officials by continually strengthening the legal defense known as qualified immunity  \u2014 a point that drew the direct ire of protesters during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. In the 12 months after Egbert, lower courts cited it 228 times in a range of cases against all kinds of federal officials, according to an NBC News search using the LexisNexis legal database. In 195 of those cases, constitutional claims were dismissed. Also in the year after the Egbert ruling, judges tossed more than a dozen lawsuits in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which Border Patrol is part of, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were defendants accused of violating constitutional rights.  Among the 15 out of 16 claims dismissed: Even when a federal employee at the Department of Homeland Security sued officials in the department for malicious prosecution after being accused of falsifying documents, a judge dismissed the claim partly on the grounds that, in line with Egbert, \u201cregulating the conduct of immigration agents similarly risks judicial intrusion into national security.\u201d Some plaintiffs gave up in light of the Egbert decision. Abdulkadir Nur, a Somali American Muslim, who said he was harassed by border protection agents at the airport every time he entered the country, withdrew his Bivens claim after the ruling was issued. \u201cIt\u2019s been predictably a nightmare. We have had to voluntarily dismiss Bivens claims in most of our cases,\u201d said Justin Sadowsky, a lawyer with the legal arm of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which represents Nur. The message to federal officers accused of misdeeds is clear: You won\u2019t face lawsuits for your actions. Without individual accountability, wrongdoers are protected and unconstitutional practices can quickly become normalized among sprawling federal agencies like the Border Patrol, civil rights advocates say. The plight facing Mattia\u2019s family puts the spotlight on how the Supreme Court ruling affects the U.S.-Mexico border, an area many already view as a lawless hinterland where constitutional rights are not respected.  \u201cThe court\u2019s opinion in Egbert is unequivocal that there is no damages action available against any Border Patrol agent for any reason,\u201d including over what happened to Mattia, said Patrick Jaicomo, a lawyer with the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.  Lawyers for the Mattia family plan to pursue a wrongful death claim against the federal government, with an announcement scheduled for Friday, the details of which were exclusively shared with NBC News. And while the lawyers say they are not yet completely ruling out bringing a lawsuit alleging constitutional violations against the officers themselves, they concede that they would be facing extremely long odds. \u201cIt makes it very, very difficult to hold the individual officers accountable in front of a jury,\u201d lawyer Timothy Scott said of the Egbert ruling. Mattia groaned motionless on the ground. \u201cHey, do not f------ move,\u201d one agent said. The agents handcuffed him,  blood soaking through his jacket. \u201cWhere\u2019s the firearm?\u201d an agent asked.  Another tended to his wounds: \u201cKeep breathing, bro,\u201d he said.  The agents encountered Mattia at 9:39 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 10:06 p.m. Whether the officers were looking for Mattia that night, or knew him before, remains unclear. His story is complicated. A toxicology report indicated he had alcohol, methamphetamine and oxycodone in his system at the time of death. He had a criminal record that included a conviction for a sex offense decades ago. For Annette Mattia, learning about the recent Supreme Court ruling feels like insult added to injury after what happened to her brother. \u201cThey know they\u2019re going to get away with it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get justice.\u201d The idea of suing government officials for constitutional violations is not a new one. In fact, the 1871 Civil Rights Act passed after the Civil War specifically allowed such claims against state and local officials. But there was a glaring omission. The law said nothing about federal officials. A hundred years later, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the Supreme Court ruled that federal officials could also be sued on similar lines. These became known as \u201cBivens\u201d claims after Webster Bivens, who filed the original lawsuit seeking damages when federal agents raided his Brooklyn apartment, without a warrant, looking for drugs. But over the following decades the court then slowly unraveled that decision. In the recent Egbert case, the court ruled 6-3 that individual Border Patrol agents generally cannot be sued for constitutional violations.  Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, cited national security risks as a reason not to allow suits against Border Patrol agents. The court ruled that a bed-and-breakfast owner near the U.S.-Canada border in Washington state could not sue an agent for excessive force following an altercation on his property. Thomas said that the court is \u201ccomparatively ill-suited to decide whether a damages remedy against any Border Patrol agent is appropriate.\u201d The ruling prompted a fierce dissenting opinion from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cAbsent intervention by Congress, CBP agents are now absolutely immunized from liability in any Bivens action for damages, no matter how egregious the misconduct or resultant injury,\u201d she wrote.  Although the ruling did not purport to overturn Bivens outright, many legal experts think that it did so in all but name, a view shared by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. \u201cI would only take the next step and acknowledge explicitly what the court leaves barely implicit,\u201d he wrote in a concurring opinion. It would only be fair to future litigants to \u201cnot hold out that kind of false hope,\u201d he added. In theory, claims addressing a small subsection of constitutional violations previously approved by the  Supreme Court, such as excessive force claims against federal agents who conduct warrantless raids similar to the one in the original Bivens case, could still go forward. But even those cases are now in question.  The decision was the second in two years in favor of Border Patrol agents, the first being Hernandez v. Mesa in 2020, which concluded that Bivens claims could not be made for incidents in which agents shoot someone on the other side of the border. The Supreme Court\u2019s stance on Bivens has infuriated a cross-ideological alliance of lawyers, with both liberal and libertarians critical of its willingness to shield federal officials.  \u201cWhat the Supreme Court has been doing with Bivens is essentially giving federal agents absolute immunity for constitutional violations. That\u2019s the endpoint to which they are marching,\u201d said Portland-based civil rights lawyer Athul Acharya. Some members of Congress have backed legislation that would allow for constitutional claims to be brought against federal officials. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who has co-sponsored legislation to codify Bivens, said in an interview that he plans to re-introduce a bill soon. \u201cIt stands to reason that federal officials should not be exempt from being held accountable by the very people that they serve. If it\u2019s good enough for state and local officials, it should be good enough for federal officials,\u201d he said. For those living in the desert reservation community of Menagers Dam Village, a cluster of one-story dwellings a two-and-a-half hour drive from Tucson, the normal rhythm of life is regularly disrupted by the unique circumstances of living a 15-minute walk from the border.  The Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which has about 28,000 members, straddles the border, with some historic lands sitting on the Mexican side. The name of the tribe translates from the O\u2019odham language as \u201cpeople of the desert.\u201d Border Patrol agents, often the focus of complaints from immigration rights advocates for heavy-handed tactics, regularly motor around in trucks and SUVs, stopping locals to ask questions. From their living room windows, residents can watch the end of the 2,500-mile journey migrants make to illegally cross the border, sometimes late at night as they walk through the village. Members of the tribe, including the Mattia family, have a mixed relationship with the agents, grateful for their efforts combating the trafficking of people and drugs, but sometimes irked by the constant presence of federal law enforcement officers on their land. \u201cIt\u2019s people on both sides of the border who are dealing with Border Patrol and their lack of respect for people, their lack of respect for life,\u201d said Yvonne Nevarez, Annette Mattia\u2019s daughter. It was the tribe\u2019s police department that called in the Border Patrol to assist on the night of the shooting, a decision that Mattia\u2019s family has also questioned. The dispatcher relayed a report of shots fired near Mattia\u2019s house. \u201cThe police officer and agents encountered an individual outside of a residence who threw an object toward the officers and abruptly extended his right arm away from his body. Three agents fired their service weapons, striking the individual several times,\u201d a Border Patrol statement on the shooting said. A spokesman declined to comment further. The Supreme Court\u2019s retrenchment on Bivens has occurred at the same time that the number of federal law enforcement agents has dramatically increased, especially within DHS, a sprawling department created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and which includes both CBP and ICE. In 2019, the Justice Department said there were about 132,000 federal law enforcement officers in total. In 1992, there were just over 4,000 Border Patrol agents, about a fifth of the current number, according to the agency. Despite being one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the nation, \u201cBorder Patrol has been given a hall pass for constitutional violations,\u201d said Mitra Ebadolahi, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has worked on border issues.  Annette Mattia saw the border patrol agents moving toward her brother\u2019s house by the side of her property. She called him on the phone and told him they were heading in his direction, where he stood outside. He told her he would talk to them, she said. \u201cAnd then I hung up with Raymond and like two seconds later, that\u2019s when I heard all the gunfire go off,\u201d she said in the interview at her home, wearing a red T-shirt bearing an image of her brother.  Clearly frustrated by the inability to bring constitutional claims against the agents, she and other family members are looking for other ways to seek justice. The options are limited. A law called the Westfall Act prevents similar claims from being brought in state court. Another law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, allows certain claims against the federal government for the conduct of officials but includes major exceptions. Claims can be brought for actions taken by federal law enforcement under the act for things like assault, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, but limits include no punitive damages and no jury trial. Plaintiffs sue the federal government, not the individual official.  It is damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act that the Mattia family\u2019s lawyers will pursue. \u201cIt\u2019s a pale substitute,\u201d said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Scott Michelman, referring to the act. He represents protesters in Washington, D.C., who sued federal officers who aggressively broke up a 2020 protest opposite the White House in Lafayette Square. The Bivens claims were dismissed. Even before the recent rulings it was difficult for plaintiffs to get a case in front of a jury, but claims could help provide leverage for a settlement. In 2017, for example, the family of Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas, a Mexican man who died after a violent struggle involving Border Patrol agents, received $1 million in a settlement. The lawsuit included both tort act and Bivens claims. Lawyers who represent officers counter that there already is accountability \u2014 individuals can be disciplined and lose their jobs as a result of internal investigations. Officers can also face criminal charges, although such incidents are exceedingly rare.  \u201cI see these as individuals. Whether they are innocent or guilty, they are human beings,\u201d said Christopher Keeven, a Washington-based lawyer who represents federal officers in Bivens cases. \u201cMaybe they just had a bad day. Maybe they did nothing wrong. Should you punish the individual or punish the government?\u201d On a recent sunny morning on the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation, there was not a Border Patrol agent in sight as Annette Mattia and her daughter Nevarez pointed to bullet holes visible in the wooden walls of her brother\u2019s house. \u201cNo trespassing,\u201d a sign posted on the building said. The border, marked only by metal stakes pounded into the desert, is about a mile away, barely visible amid the cactus plants and scrub.  His family has built a memorial on the spot where Mattia died, featuring a simple wooden cross, a small statute of the Virgin Mary and a sigh saying \u201cJustice for Raymond Mattia.\u201d Mattia had at times worked as an electrician and enjoyed various artistic pursuits, including drawing and making pottery. He served on the local tribal council and had two grown children.  Visiting the site brings back painful memories for his loved ones, who still find it hard to process what happened. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t acting erratic. He wasn\u2019t trying to run. He was complying and they shot him. And as he lay dying, they continued to threaten to shoot him,\u201d Nevarez said. The family has placed a bottle of water in front of the memorial to provide nourishment on his journey. \u201cWe leave the water, you know, for him,\u201d Annette Mattia said.  \u201cIn a sense, I feel he\u2019s still around.\u201d Lawrence Hurley covers the Supreme Court for NBC News.

        "title": "Biden signs funding bill, averting a government shutdown",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday signed the stopgap funding bill passed by the Senate Wednesday night, punting the GOP's spending fight and the threat of a government shutdown until after the holidays. Wednesday's bipartisan vote was 87-11, with 10 Republicans and one Democrat \u2014 Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado \u2014 voting against the bill. \"Because of bipartisan cooperation, we are keeping the government open without any poison pills or harmful cuts to vital programs \u2014 a great outcome for the American people,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the vote. The short-term bill, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, cleared the House on Tuesday on a lopsided 336-95 vote, with all but two of the no votes coming from Republicans. \u201cIf the speaker is willing to work with Democrats and resist the siren song of the hard right in the House,\u201d Schumer continued, \u201cthen we can avoid shutdowns in the future and finish the work of funding the government.\u201d Without the CR, government funding would have run out late Friday. New House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s staggered, or \"laddered,\" CR would fund part of the government \u2014 including the Agriculture, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Affairs departments \u2014 through Jan. 19 and fund the Defense Department and remaining parts of the government through Feb. 2. Passing a two-part CR that funds the government into the New Year will prevent Congress from adopting yet another massive omnibus spending package right before Christmas, argued Johnson, R-La. The CR is \u201cclean,\u201d with no spending cuts or contentious policy provisions that would alienate Democrats. It also does not include a supplemental package covering things like aid for Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance or border security, leaving those issues for later in the year. The CR is designed to buy more time for House Republicans to pass appropriations bills and for House and Senate negotiators to reach a deal on funding. The House has passed seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund the government for a full fiscal year, while the Senate has passed three. But as recently as Wednesday, House Republicans were struggling to advance their individual appropriations bills over intraparty divisions over amendments, raising questions about whether the House will be able to complete its spending bills before the next funding deadlines. Johnson and his leadership team sent House lawmakers home for the Thanksgiving holiday early on Wednesday after two appropriations bills ran into trouble. \"We're demanding of our leadership: Put the right bills on the floor with the right policy in them at the right levels, and then we'll vote for them,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the chairman of the far-right Freedom Caucus, who led the opposition. \"But don't act like you're actually trying to get to a correct spending level, and don't act like you're actually going to fight on these issues when you plan to fail.\" Still, Johnson brushed off questions about whether he's frustrated by the setbacks. \"No, we're not frustrated. This is part of the process. We're working toward consensus,\" Johnson said after votes were called off. \"I've been on the job less than three weeks. I think we've had a great run.\" Asked whether House Democrats' morale was high amid the GOP infighting, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., recounted that his weekly report to the Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday was short and sweet. \"No spending cuts, no right-wing extreme policy changes, no government shutdown, no votes tomorrow, Happy Thanksgiving,\" he said. \"That is a type of report that, when you are able to give it, means morale is very high.\" Did Jeffries have any advice for the new speaker? a reporter followed up. \"Good luck!\" he quipped. Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News. Kate Santaliz is a researcher for NBC News\u2019 Capitol Hill team. ",

        "content": "An Ohio man who repeatedly attacked police officers as he joined a mob of Donald Trump supporters in storming the U.S. Capitol was sentenced on Thursday to nearly five years in prison. Kenneth Joseph Owen Thomas has acted as a \u201cone-man misinformation machine\u201d since the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, using his social media platforms to spread false narratives about the attack, according to federal prosecutors. They say Thomas produces more than 20 hours of Jan. 6-related online content every week. \u201cThe primary message Thomas attempts to convey throughout all of his appearances is \u2018Jan 6th was a Setup,\u2019 words that are emblazoned front and center on the landing page for the website and \u2018brand\u2019 he created after his arrest,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich sentenced Thomas, 41, of East Liverpool, Ohio, to four years and 10 months of incarceration, according to online court records. The judge also ordered him to pay a $20,000 fine and $2,000 in restitution. Prosecutors recommended a prison term of nine years and one month and sought a fine of $77,607. Thomas, they say, has raised at least that much money in online forums, including a website called, \u201cHelp Joseph Thomas Let Freedom Sing.\u201d Thomas was arrested in Huntsville, Alabama, in May 2021. In June 2023, a jury in Washington, D.C., convicted Thomas of assault charges and other offenses. Jurors also acquitted him of two counts, including obstruction of a congressional proceeding, and deadlocked on two other counts. Thomas\u2019 attorneys said he is \u201cbrutally aware of the seriousness of his conduct\u201d on Jan. 6 and takes \u201cfull and complete responsibility for his actions.\u201d \u201cNone of the officers contacted by Mr. Thomas on Jan. 6 reported any physical pain or injuries attributed to Mr. Thomas. In fact at least one of the officers openly admitted under oath in open court that he didn\u2019t even remember Mr. Thomas at all,\u201d the defense lawyers wrote. More than 100 police officers were injured at the Capitol, where the mob temporarily stopped Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral victory over Trump. Thomas attended Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally near the White House with his wife and daughter, but he left them behind as he marched to the Capitol. Thomas physically and verbally attacked police lines and urged other rioters to \u201chold the line\u201d with him, prosecutors said. He also repeatedly shouted at police to \u201dstand down\u201d and joined a chant calling them \u201ctraitors.\u201d Police body camera video captured Thomas charging at a line of officers in riot gear, shoving an officer who pushed him back down a set of steps. \u201cUndeterred by having been repulsed once, Thomas again pumped his arms and charged full speed up the steps a second time,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Video shows him pushing another officer\u2019s chest. Over the next hour, he continued to harass and push back against officers who were trying to clear the Capitol\u2019s Upper West Terrace, prosecutors said. A police officer who testified at Thomas\u2019 trial said rioters turned their backs on police, linked arms and collectively pushed against the line of officers. \u201cWhen we were trying to push, I remember just being pressed so hard it felt like my lungs caving in. It felt like they couldn\u2019t expand. I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d the officer said, according to prosecutors. Thomas appeared to be streaming live video while attacking police, according to prosecutors. \u201cDespite Thomas\u2019 persistent efforts to minimize and, in fact to valorize, his conduct, he was a key figure in a violent riot and assaulted numerous police officers,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Thomas served in the U.S. Navy but was dismissed after getting punished three times for misconduct. He also has a criminal record that includes convictions for domestic battery and burglary, according to prosecutors. Approximately 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Over 800 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury or judge after a trial. Over 700 of them have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from three days to 22 years. ",

        "title": "Man who attacked Rep. Angie Craig sentenced to 27 months in prison",
        "content": "A man who pleaded guilty to attacking Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota in a Washington, D.C., elevator this year was sentenced Thursday to 27 months in prison. Kendrid Khalil Hamlin of Washington was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg. He also faces 36 months of supervised release after his prison term, the Justice Department said in a news release. Hamlin pleaded guilty in June to one count of assault on a member of Congress stemming from the Feb. 9 attack, in addition to two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer. A spokesperson for Craig did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. In a victim statement filed this week, Craig said that Hamlin had followed her into the elevator of her apartment complex and trapped her there. \u201cHe grabbed my neck and slammed me into the steel wall. He punched me in the face,\u201d she wrote, adding that the attack left her bruised and with a cut lip. \u201cWhile my physical recovery was days, my mental and emotional recovery has taken much longer and is ongoing,\u201d Craig wrote, noting that she faced death threats and was forced to move amid media commentary about her attack. According to court documents, Hamlin also assaulted officers who attempted to arrest him. He has remained in custody since then. Hamlin's 27-month sentence is less than the 39 months sought by prosecutors, who in court documents referred to Hamlin's past convictions for assaulting officers. In a statement Thursday, Hamlin's attorneys Gene Ohm and Katie D\u2019Adamo Guevara said their client is \"deeply remorseful\" for the harm he caused Craig. \"While we are disappointed in the length of the prison sentence, we are hopeful that he will finally get the mental health treatment he has been seeking and desperately needs upon release,\" they said. Hamlin's attorneys had pushed for a sentencing of one year and a day, and said that Hamlin suffered from severe mental illness and was \u201coff his medication, living in the streets, and struggling acutely with addiction\u201d at the time of his arrest. An attorney for Hamlin previously said that Hamlin did not know Craig was a member of Congress, and Capitol Police have said there was no evidence the congresswoman was targeted because of her position.

        "title": "Appeals court temporarily lifts Trump gag order in civil fraud case",
        "content": "A New York appeals court on Thursday temporarily blocked a gag order in former President Donald Trump's civil fraud trial that barred him from complaining about the judge's law clerk. The Appellate Division judge ordered the stay after Trump's attorneys appealed the gag order that Judge Arthur Engoron had put in place as being \"unconstitutional.\" In a brief handwritten ruling Thursday, Appellate Division Justice David Friedman said he was granting an interim stay on the gag order given the \u201cconstitutional and statutory rights at issue.\u201d The pause will remain in place until at least Nov. 27, when a full panel of appeals court judges will consider the matter. Trump bashed the clerk on his social media platform Truth Social hours after the ruling in a post that did not name her but celebrated the appeals court ruling. The post criticized Engoron's \"ridiculous and unconstitutional gag order\" for \"not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW.\" The gag order did not prohibit Trump from criticizing Engoron. Engoron imposed the gag order last month, on the second day of the $250 million New York civil fraud trial, after Trump posted a picture of the clerk and disparaged her in a Truth Social post. \u201cPersonal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I won\u2019t tolerate it,\u201d Engoron said after finding out about the social media post and critical comments Trump had made about the clerk to reporters covering the trial in Manhattan. The judge has fined Trump twice for a total of $15,000 after finding he violated last month's order. The judge expanded the order to include Trump\u2019s attorneys last week, following their repeated complaints about what they described as the clerk's \"inappropriate behavior,\" which they said included making comments and passing notes to the judge and rolling her eyes during witness testimony. Engoron said at the time that he has every right to get advice from his clerk and that Trump's lawyers were \u201cfalsely accusing her of bias against them and of improperly influencing the ongoing bench trial,\u201d while ordering them not to refer to his staff. He said in a written ruling that his chambers had been \"inundated\" with threats since the trial began on Oct. 2. In their appeal, Trump's lawyers argued that the gag orders were \"not narrowly tailored.\" \"The mere potential that speech may anger or provoke others likewise does not entitle Justice Engoron to suspend wholesale the rights afforded litigants by the First Amendment and the New York Constitution,\" Trump attorneys wrote. \"The First Amendment does not permit Justice Engoron to restrict speech based on the audience\u2019s anticipated unruly reaction.\" They also contended that the fines Trump was hit with were excessive, and that Engoron had not followed proper procedure in imposing them. The appeal Wednesday did not mention the name of Engoron's clerk, but included numerous pictures of her. Trump's attorneys also filed a motion for a mistrial on Wednesday, which included repeated references to the clerk's name in addition to numerous pictures. Friedman, who hit pause on the gag order, is the same appellate judge who issued a temporary stay of the trial in September, citing concerns by Trump\u2019s lawyers regarding outstanding legal issues. A full five-judge panel that included Friedman lifted the stay before the trial started. \"Fortunately, the Constitution and the First Amendment protect everyone, including President Trump,\" Trump attorney Chrise Kise said Thursday. \"The public will again have full access to what is really taking place in this unprecedented trial.\" Another Trump lawyer, Alina Habba, told The Associated Press at the Appellate Division courthouse that she would not be advising Trump to keep quiet about the clerk. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason for restrictions because Ms. James is continuing to disparage my client,\u201d she said, referring to New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the fraud case against Trump and his company. \u201cBoth sides need to be able to speak.\" Trump was also hit with a gag order in the federal criminal election interference case against him, which barred him from making statements about potential witnesses or disparaging comments about the prosecutors, court staff or support personnel. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's presiding over that case, briefly lifted the order last month pending Trump's appeal on constitutional grounds, but eventually put it back in place. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., will hear arguments Monday on Trump's appeal in the federal case. Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

        "title": "Hunter Biden interviewed by the special counsel in his father's classified docs probe",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel appointed to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents has interviewed the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, according to a source familiar with the matter. Special counsel Robert Hur reached out to Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team for an interview about two months ago, a second source familiar with the matter said. Spokespeople for Hur and the Justice Department declined requests for comment, as did the White House. A lawyer for Hunter Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the interview. The White House last month said the president was interviewed Oct. 8-9 as part of the documents investigation after months of negotiations between Biden and Hur over the terms of an interview. The probe was initiated after the White House said in January that documents with classified markings were uncovered at Biden\u2019s Delaware home and at a Washington office he used after he was vice president. The subject of an investigation typically is interviews near the end of a probe, if at all. Hur's investigation has stretched into its 11th month. It remains unclear whether he is expected to bring charges. Hur is expected to deliver a report with his findings at the conclusion of his investigation, which has sparked anxiety among the president's aides. Some have privately expressed concern that the probe will conclude with a politically damaging outcome as Biden campaigns for re-election, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. Additional concern is swirling within the White House that Hur and, more broadly, the Justice Department are overly sensitive to Republican congressional oversight of their work, a third source said. Multiple sources also drew comparisons to former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s delivering a stinging rebuke of Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign related to an investigation into her emails while she was secretary of state. While Clinton was not guilty of wrongdoing, she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, Comey said about four months before she lost the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans have raised questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s proximity to the classified documents that were stored at the president's home in Wilmington, Delaware. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote a letter to the White House in January questioning whether Hunter Biden had access to any of the classified documents in his father\u2019s possession. Hunter Biden listed his father\u2019s Wilmington home as his address on his driver\u2019s license during the time frame when classified documents were stored there. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, has said he did so because the Wilmington house \u201cwas his only permanent address at the time.\u201d The classified documents probe has unfolded as the president\u2019s predecessor, former President Donald Trump, is accused of mishandling documents. Trump also faces allegations that he told a property manager at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida to delete security video allegedly showing how his employees moved boxes of documents before the FBI searched the property. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has sought to liken his handling of documents to Biden's. The president's aides have resisted the comparison, arguing that Biden promptly returned classified documents to the government when they were discovered in his office and then voluntarily allowed federal authorities to search his properties for additional materials.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A man who claimed to be a journalist and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement was convicted Thursday on all charges against him in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. John Earle Sullivan, a 29-year-old from Utah also known as \"Jayden X,\" was convicted of seven counts after just a few hours of deliberation by the jury. Federal prosecutors requested that Sullivan be taken into custody until his sentencing, and U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered him remanded, according to court records. The charges included felony obstruction of an official proceeding and civil disorder. Sullivan shot one of the most infamous videos of Jan. 6, showing the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt, and sold the rights to several media outlets, including NBC News. \u201cI was only observing,\u201d Sullivan said in his trial testimony. \u201cI followed the crowd.

        "title": "Haley secures former Tim Scott donors as her money momentum continues",
        "content": "First comes the momentum, then comes the money. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s presidential bid started to pick up the first after well-received early debate performances. Now, she is starting to vacuum up the second, as an increasing number of GOP donors who oppose former President Donald Trump see her as the best alternative.  That interest has picked up in recent weeks, including among donors who previously backed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott but have started to raise money for Haley in the wake of her home-state rival's exit from the race. Scott\u2019s exit set up a donor and supporter scramble in South Carolina, as she continues to jockey with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the title of the most viable candidate besides Trump, who still holds a huge lead in the polls despite their pressure. \u201cTim Scott\u2019s exit was a signal to donors that the time to coalesce around Nikki Haley is now,\u201d said Alex Stroman, a South Carolina Republican operative who is currently unaligned. \u201cMajor donors don\u2019t just write large checks out of the goodness of their hearts: They are discerning with their money. Making financial investments in Nikki Haley right now will help her win the nomination and easily win the presidency, and her coattails will be long for local, state and federal candidates.\u201d DeSantis has also touted bringing in more money after the latest GOP debate, and he tasked his finance team with courting former Scott donors, too. But the move by a small group of past Scott fundraisers to shift allegiances to Haley is already paying off for the former South Carolina governor.  Eric Levine, a former Scott donor and co-host for a New York fundraising event for Haley next month, said he anticipates being able to raise at least $100,000 on his own at the fundraiser. He called the response he's getting \u201cincredible\u201d and said that the donors he\u2019s hitting up for the December event are \u201cmore enthusiastic\u201d than those that gave and attended the gatherings he helped organize for Scott.  \u201cShe has serious momentum and folks genuinely believe she can beat Trump and easily win the general against Biden,\u201d Levine said in a text message. The Haley event in New York has three other co-hosts with ties to GOP megadonor Paul Singer and one of his close advisers. Terry Kassel, the head of strategic human resources at Singer\u2019s investment firm, Elliott Management, is listed on the invite as a co-host. Another co-host, former Meta executive and TV anchor Campbell Brown, is married to Elliott Management's chief public affairs officer, Dan Senor. And Annie Dickerson, who is also listed as a co-host, has reportedly been a \u201cclose confidante\u201d of Singer\u2019s for years, according to Politico. Levine said he has \u201chope\u201d that their involvement with the event is a sign Singer might be planning to back Haley in the 2024 primary, though Singer has not publicly given any indication whom he plans to support \u2014 or if he will get involved with the primary at all.  Meanwhile, in Iowa, David Oman, a former chief of staff to two Republican governors and former co-chair of the state GOP, said that after watching the race develop, he and a network of about 70 friends and allies, many of them longtime Republican activists, decided it was time to get off the sidelines and throw their support to Haley before it became too late to affect the outcome. The goal of the group, which was rolled out by the Haley campaign this week, is to help her organize on the ground in the short window before the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses \u2014 creating a complement for the cash that is rolling into her coffers. \u201cThe financing of presidential campaigns, super PACs and all that, goes on above us and around us,\u201d Oman said. \u201cI believe this group can and will be helpful with Iowans, with caucusgoers.\u201d Haley's snagging new donors and supporters as the GOP field shrinks speaks to her rising status \u2014 and rising needs. Haley has laid down $10 million worth of advertising plans in Iowa and New Hampshire going forward. And while DeSantis has been losing ground to Trump in public polls, he also built up a deep reserve of cash in his super PAC before he even announced his candidacy. His campaign had significantly outraised Haley's through the most recent campaign finance reports. \u201cI think Haley and DeSantis are the only candidates left in the race with a chance to stop Trump from being the nominee,\u201d said Chad Walldorf, the co-founder of Sticky Fingers restaurants and a previous Scott supporter. \u201cWhile I think DeSantis has been a good governor in many respects, I don\u2019t think that has translated onto the national stage where he has spent tens of millions of dollars only to see his support drop precipitously.\u201d Walldorf, who served on Haley\u2019s gubernatorial transition team after her successful 2010 campaign, said he is hoping to host a fundraiser for Haley and is speaking with her finance team on Friday to see how he can be more helpful to her campaign. He says he is specifically impressed with her views on helping Ukraine and Israel. Billionaire Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, who gave $10 million to back DeSantis' runs for Florida governor, told Bloomberg TV earlier this week that he was \"actively contemplating\" financially backing Haley. Another snapshot of Haley establishing herself as a rising Trump counterweight came Thursday in a new New Hampshire poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire. The poll showed 42% of likely GOP primary voters supporting Trump, but Haley was far and away the second choice, getting 20%. For Haley it\u2019s an 8-point increase since the last CNN/University of New Hampshire poll in September. Meanwhile, DeSantis dropped a point from that last poll, and is now in fourth at 9%, behind former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's 14%. DeSantis has spent relatively little time focused on New Hampshire, instead going all in on performing well in the Iowa caucuses, where a good showing could give him a shot of momentum heading into other states where he's spent less time so far. DeSantis has been moving key staff to Iowa, spending most of his time there, and earlier this month scored the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a big win the campaign is already featuring in TV ads. \u201cWe need someone who puts this country first and not himself,\u201d Reynolds says in an ad in rotation in Iowa. \u201cRon DeSantis is the person that we need leading this country. He is probably the most effective leader that I know. I am so proud to give him my full support and endorsement.\u201d Haley, who has announced dozens of her own Iowa endorsements from lower-profile officials, was tied with DeSantis at 16% in the October NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll. Trump continued to lead by huge margins, bringing in 43%. The same poll found that the exit of Scott, who got 7%, was unlikely to give a significant boost to any of the non-Trump candidates. The early-state showdown between DeSantis and Haley, including the hustle for endorsements and cash, underscores an increasingly undeniable reality of the Republican presidential primary.  \u201cThere is no path forward for any of the other candidates still in the races,\u201d Stroman, the South Carolina operative, said. \u201cIt\u2019s either Ambassador Haley or Governor DeSantis versus Donald Trump.\u201d Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.

        "content": "On Wednesday night, current lawmakers and candidates were mingling inside the Democratic National Committee's headquarters. The guest list included top party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California. But the quiet Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was unexpectedly thrust into the national spotlight when it was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters who came to the doorstep of the DNC. A lawmaker who was inside the building said about 50 people were at the event. The person said that they heard chanting and tried to leave but that police said the building was on lockdown and no one could leave. The lawmaker said it soon became clear that something was out of the ordinary when a U.S. Capitol Police officer was brought in, suffering from pepper spray. \u201cIt reminded me of Jan. 6,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt rattled me.\u201d NBC News has confirmed that Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Brad Sherman of California and Debbie Dingell of Michigan were also at the DNC event. Eventually the Democratic leaders were able to leave the building in their cars through the basement garage, and the lawmaker who spoke to NBC News was able to get a ride in one of the leaders\u2019 cars. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d the lawmaker said of Capitol Police.  In a statement Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden had called into a DNC and campaign staff meeting: \"They expressed appreciation to law enforcement who kept everyone inside the DNC safe last night, including staff and Members of Congress.\" Capitol Police said Wednesday night on X that a \u201clarge group of illegal protesters ... have cleared out, but USCP officers will stay on scene out of an abundance of caution.\u201d They previously put the number of demonstrators at about 150, who they said were \u201cviolently protesting.\u201d Police said that six officers were treated for injuries as a result of the demonstration and that one person was arrested and accused of assaulting an officer. Sherman tweeted Wednesday that he was evacuated from the DNC \u201cafter pro-terrorist, anti-#Israel protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building.\u201d In a joint statement Thursday, Jeffries, Clark, Aguilar and campaign committee Chair Suzan DelBene of Washington thanked Capitol Police and alleged that \"some protesters escalated their activity in a manner that exceeded a peaceful demonstration.\" Protesters have repeatedly disputed the claim that protesters pepper-sprayed police. During a virtual news conference Thursday morning, organizers of the protest alleged that about 90 demonstrators were injured by police. Organizers alleged that \u201ca peaceful protester was hit by, hit with bicycles by two different cops,\" another \"was pepper-sprayed directly in the face by police\" and \u201cat least two peaceful protesters\u2019 glasses were smashed by the police,\" among other violent incidents. Eva Borgwardt, a spokesperson for IfNotNow \u2014 a group that describes itself as \u201cAmerican Jews organizing our community to end U.S. support for Israel\u2019s apartheid system\u201d \u2014 disputed Sherman's account, saying he is \u201cspreading dangerous and reckless misinformation about our nonviolent movement.\u201d She added that protesters had engaged in nonviolent acts of civil disobedience \"to call on Democrats to support a cease-fire and an end to our government\u2019s funding of violence against Palestinian civilians.\" \u201cI personally have never seen such a, like, fast and violent escalation by police with no warning,\u201d Borgwardt said. \u201cProtesters were singing in front of the door to the DNC, and almost immediately, the police were trying to, like, tear them off of each other and shove them down the stairs. \u201cAnd then the peaceful protesters that were assembled in the street \u2014 again, we were holding candles to represent the Palestinian lives lost \u2014 and officers were shoving everyone out of the street with their bicycles, with no warning or explanation,\u201d she added. Capitol Police alleged in a statement Thursday morning that the group \u201cmoved dumpsters in front of the exits\u201d and \u201cpepper sprayed our officers.\u201d Asked by NBC News to respond to the statement, Borgwardt said she \u201cdid not see anything like that\u201d and maintained that protesters did not pepper-spray officers. Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg, one of the organizers of the rally, said that police had the tools needed to carry out a dispersal order peacefully and nonviolently to safely remove protesters but that \u201cinstead they chose to push people and shove people and hit and pepper spray.\u201d \u201cThe police have tools to deal with nonviolent civil disobedience, and last night they chose not to use them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to know why.\u201d Kyle Stewart is an associate producer covering Congress for NBC News.

        "title": "Supreme Court declines Florida's request to enforce law targeting drag shows",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Florida\u2019s bid to enforce a state law that targets drag show performances that, challengers say, imposes unlawful restrictions on free speech. The court, divided 6-3, with three conservatives dissenting, turned away an emergency request from Florida officials after lower courts blocked the law statewide. The majority did not explain its reasoning. The measure, widely seen as part of a conservative campaign against LGBTQ rights, was passed this year by the Florida Legislature. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination and has frequently leaned into culture war issues, signed the bill into law. DeSantis this year also signed into law a bill that restricts transgender health care. Officially dubbed the Protection of Children Act, the law makes it a crime to admit a child to an \u201cadult live performance\u201d that the state deems sexually explicit. The three justices who would have granted the state's request were Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. A district court judge blocked the law under the First Amendment in part because it was too vaguely written, with key terms such as \u201clewd conduct\u201d not defined. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left that ruling in place. The legal challenge was brought by an Orlando bar and restaurant called Hamburger Mary\u2019s, which hosts what it calls family friendly drag shows. The restaurant\u2019s lawyers said in court papers that the shows \u201care not harmful to minors but likely still run afoul of the act due to its overbreadth and vagueness.\u201d The district court prevented the state from enforcing the law not just against Hamburger Mary\u2019s but also statewide. The state argued that the judge did not have authority to do so. In its application to the Supreme Court, the state asked the justices to narrow the injunction so it applied only to the restaurant. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative, wrote a brief opinion explaining why he voted against the state, saying the narrow issue the state was raising was not one the court would normally hear. Fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined most of Kavanaugh's opinion. \"This case is therefore an imperfect vehicle for considering the general question of whether a district court may enjoin a government from enforcing a law against non-parties to the litigation,\" he wrote.

        "title": "David DePape found guilty in Paul Pelosi hammer attack case",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A federal jury on Thursday convicted the man who attacked Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with a hammer during a break-in last year at the couple's San Francisco home. David DePape looked down and showed no emotion as the panel found him guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. The 12 jurors were pulled from a pool of 15 jurors and alternates comprising 12 men and three women. They deliberated for seven hours over two days, about 4\u00bd hours on Wednesday and 2\u00bd hours on Thursday. DePape, 43, faces up to life in federal prison, and he still faces state charges \u2014 attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, residential burglary, false imprisonment and threatening the life of or serious bodily harm to a public official \u2014 connected to the terrifying invasion of the Pelosis' Pacific Heights home. Paul Pelosi, 83, sustained a fractured skull in the Oct. 28, 2022, attack. \"The Pelosi family is very proud of their Pop, who demonstrated extraordinary composure and courage on the night of the attack a year ago,\" the Pelosi family said in a statement Thursday. \"Thankfully, Mr. Pelosi continues to make progress in his recovery.\" U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey said he hopes the verdicts will serve as a statement against political violence. \"What this guilty verdict on all counts sends is a clear message that regardless of what your beliefs are, what you cannot do is physically attack a member of Congress or their immediate family for their performance in their job,\" Ramsey told reporters outside the courthouse in downtown San Francisco. The prosecutors declined to answer reporters' questions. DePape's lead defense attorney also declined to answer questions as she left the courthouse. DePape is due back in federal court Dec. 13, when the sides will set a date for sentencing. The verdict came at the tail end of a chaotic Thursday morning in San Francisco. Commuters faced roadblocks and closures throughout California\u2019s fourth-biggest city as it hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. And about 6 miles northwest of the courthouse, protesters demanding a cease-fire in Gaza took over inbound lanes of the Bay Bridge \u2014 the famed span that connects Oakland and San Francisco. DePape\u2019s next date in state court is Nov. 29, and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins seemed to hint that her case might not go forward in the wake of the successful federal prosecution. \u201cWe will confer with the federal prosecutors, and with the victim in this case, as we determine what our next steps in the state case will be,\u201d Jenkins said in a statement.  \u201cMr. DePape is facing a different set of charges in our case, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse and false imprisonment. We are confident in our case and are prepared to move forward to trial,\" she said. In the federal case, DePape and his defense never contested that he broke into the Pelosis' home and hit Paul Pelosi with a hammer. Instead, the defense tried attempted a narrow argument that DePape never intended to kidnap anyone and that his actions that late night and early morning were not tied specifically to Pelosi's work as a federal lawmaker. The defense tried to claim that DePape wanted to use Pelosi and her husband to help him reach a person the government has labeled \u201cTarget 1.\u201d That person has been identified as Bay Area scholar and Gayle Rubin, a University of Michigan professor who is a leading academic in feminist theory and queer studies. Before closing arguments began Wednesday, a member of U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's staff and a juror were in the same elevator when they overheard two people discussing the case, the court employee said. The elevator riders apparently supported the defense's contention that Rubin, not Pelosi or her husband, was DePape's true target, the court employee said. The panelist, juror No. 3, was allowed to remain on the case, and Corley reminded the jury to consider only evidence heard in court. The trial in downtown San Francisco laid bare the corrosive impact of conspiracy theories and misinformation in modern politics. DePape surprisingly took the witness stand in his own defense Tuesday and rattled off a long list of baseless allegations and grievances \u2014 many of which regularly echo through far-right circles \u2014 that motivated him to break into the Pelosis\u2019 home.

        "title": "Georgia judge issues protective order after leaked witness videos in Trump election interference case",
        "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 The judge in the Georgia election interference case has granted a request from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office for an emergency protective order after parts of videos from key witnesses against former President Donald Trump and his allies were leaked to news outlets.Judge Scott McAfee on Thursday issued a protective order that prohibits attorneys in the case from sharing sensitive materials with the public. The order requires prosecutors to physically label evidence it seeks to protect as \u201csensitive material\u201d and gives defense attorneys 14 days to contest any designations they disagree with. Willis\u2019 team now has 30 days to review all discovery they\u2019ve already provided and label as sensitive. McAfee said that the order would promote the flow of pre-trial discovery and, more importantly, protect the jury pool from evidence that may be deemed inadmissible at trial. \u201cThe Court has an interest in ensuring that all parties retain their right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, a process that could become unattainable should the public be allowed to vet every piece of unfiltered evidence months before trial,\u201d McAfee wrote in the filing. Willis\u2019 office asked for the protective order in a court filing Tuesday after parts of the videotaped statements of Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro and bail bondsman Scott Hall were made public. In its filing, Willis' office argued that an order was necessary \u201cto protect witnesses and to safeguard sensitive and confidential information\u201d during the discovery process. It said the leaks were \u201cclearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case, subjecting them to harassment and threats prior to trial.\u201d The DA in August charged 19 defendants with violating Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization act in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the battleground state. Chesebro, Ellis, Hall and Powell have pleaded guilty. The videotaped statements, known as proffer videos, were made pursuant to the four defendants\u2019 plea agreements, which required them to give true and accurate information to prosecutors. The Ellis and Powell statements were first reported by ABC News, while the Chesebro and Hall statements were first reported by The Washington Post. The recordings, which have not been independently obtained by NBC News, revealed new details of the defendants' testimony to prosecutors. The videos showed Ellis recalling a conversation with Trump adviser Dan Scavino, who told her that Trump would not depart the White House regardless of the election results, she said. Powell had testified that Trump was repeatedly told by others that he\u2019d lost the election to President Joe Biden. A lawyer for Trump co-defendant Misty Hampton admitted at a hearing Wednesday that he had shared witness proffer videos of key figures in the case with a media outlet, saying he thought it was in his client\u2019s best interest. Jonathan Miller, an attorney for Hampton, made the admission during an emergency hearing Wednesday for the protective order. Hampton is charged with a scheme to access voting machines in Coffee County, which Powell and Hall were also charged with. \u201cIn being transparent with the court and to make sure that nobody else gets blamed for what happened and so that I can go to sleep well tonight, judge, I did release those videos to one outlet,\u201d Miller told McAfee during the hearing. \u201cIn all candor to the court, I need the court to know that.\" McAfee had signaled Wednesday that he would issue a protective order barring the disclosure of certain discovery information by Thursday morning. He said the order would institute a process by which parties can label certain evidence as sensitive. \u201cUntil we decide what\u2019s going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,\u201d McAfee said during Wednesday's hearing. Tom Clyde, an attorney for a coalition of media organizations that did not include NBC News, objected to the protective order, citing First Amendment interests, during the hearing Wednesday. \u201cEssentially what the state and the defendants are trying to do is get the authority of the court behind an order that will impose secrecy on information that is exchanged during the discovery process. Notwithstanding how newsworthy that information is, notwithstanding how much it might inform the public about the circumstances of this case, but particularly in this case, the circumstances of an election that took place, that\u2019s extremely significant in public importance,\u201d Clyde said. McAfee said he disagreed with Clyde\u2019s arguments, but acknowledged the First Amendment concerns. The judge said a protective order was needed to protect the jury pool and to keep the flow of discovery going. \u201cUntil we decide what\u2019s going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,\u201d he said during the hearing Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen what may happen when a protective order is not in place.\u201d The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Dec. 1, when several motions from defendants will be argued. Charlie Gile reported from Atlanta, and Summer Concepcion from New York. Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News. ",

George Santos, R-N.Y., alleges he was a cash-strapped candidate who used campaign contributions to live a life of luxury \u2014 including spending donors' money on trips to casinos, shopping at high-end retailers and even Botox treatments and OnlyFans payments. \"Representative Santos was frequently in debt, had an abysmal credit score, and relied on an ever-growing wallet of high-interest credit cards to fund his luxury spending habits.

        "content": "The New Hampshire Democratic Party's Belknap County office was vandalized with antisemitic and white supremacist symbols and messages amid reports by watchdog groups of increases in antisemitic and other bias incidents in the U.S. Democrats are \"outraged and horrified by the recent discovery of antisemitic and white supremacist graffiti\" at the office in Laconia, state party Chair Raymond Buckley said in a statement Thursday morning. \"The documented rise in these hate crimes here in New Hampshire is alarming and unacceptable,\" Buckley said. \"We must confront and challenge this vile ideology at every turn. We stand in unwavering solidarity with the Jewish community and all those targeted by these abhorrent acts. We will not be intimidated or deterred in our fight against bigotry.\" The vandalism included swastikas and an antisemitic slur spray-painted on the side of the group's headquarters, according to Laconia Police Chief Matthew Canfield and Colin Booth, communications director for the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Posters were also discovered glued to the side of the building featuring a star of David with a knife through it, as well as conspiracy theories about Jews and the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Johnna Davis, the chair of the Belknap County Democratic Committee, told NBC News that she believes they were targeted because of a post on the group's Facebook page last week about an event at a local synagogue to commemorate Kristallnacht. The state party doesn't know who is responsible for vandalizing the property, said Booth, who added that the New Hampshire Democratic Party notified the state attorney general's office in the hope that the incident can be investigated as a hate crime and solved quickly. Michael Garrity, a spokesman for Attorney General John Formella, said the attorney general's office is working with the Laconia Police Department. \"Hate crimes and civil rights violations have no place in New Hampshire,\" Garrity said. \"The attorney general\u2019s office is committed to working with our local, state, and federal partners to identify these acts and their perpetrators and to pursuing action to the fullest extent possible.\" Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., said on X: \"I\u2019m thinking of all my friends in Laconia tonight. This antisemitic vandalism is part of a surge in hateful attacks on the Jewish community across the country. There is simply no place for bigotry and hate in our society, and we must speak with one voice to condemn it.\" FBI Director Christopher Wray recently testified before Congress about the rise in antisemitism and domestic extremism in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and subsequent conflict in Gaza.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While there were plenty of major global issues on the agenda for President Joe Biden\u2019s summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, the suggestion of sending new pandas to the U.S. was not on the list and did not come up during the talks, a senior administration official said. So when Xi announced at a dinner with business leaders later in the evening that China was \u201cready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation,\u201d it came as a surprise to the White House. Xi indicated that China would \u201cdo our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties\" between the two countries, and he even referred to the San Diego Zoo as a potential home for future pandas.  The U.S. viewed the comments as a \u201cgoodwill gesture,\u201d the senior administration official said, after Biden and Xi had spent more than four hours together in their first face-to-face meeting in a year. The official said the panda news was not planned or choreographed beforehand with the White House. Xi referred to the pandas as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples,\u201d but he did not share additional details about when or how the next steps would take place. Three giant pandas left the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., last week, traveling from Dulles International Airport on a FedEx flight to Chengdu, China, a roughly 19-hour journey. \u201cI was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas and went to the zoo to see them off,\u201d Xi said Wednesday.  There are still some pandas in the U.S. at Zoo Atlanta, but they are set to depart next year if the deal is not extended. The panda agreements are made between the Chinese government and American zoos, without the direct involvement of the U.S. government. The San Diego Zoo said it did not have any kind of heads-up that Xi would refer to them in his remarks.  \u201cWe are excited to hear of President Xi\u2019s commitment in continuing the giant panda conservation efforts between our two countries, and his attention to the wish of Californians and the San Diego Zoo to see the return of giant pandas,\u201d Paul A. Baribault, the president and chief executive of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said in a statement.  \u201cConservation starts with people, and our team is committed to working with our partners to welcome the next generation of giant pandas to our zoo, continuing our joint efforts in wildlife conservation, and inspiring millions worldwide to protect the planet we all share,\u201d he said.

        "title": "California's first lesbian Senate leader could make history again if she runs for governor",
        "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 The first time Toni Atkins acted as the governor of California, she used her powers to honor the passing of San Diego Padres baseball player Tony Gwynn while playfully rebuffing Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s advice that she \u201cinvade Oregon. \u201d It was 2014, and Atkins \u2014 the first lesbian to be the speaker of the state Assembly \u2014 was filling in for former Gov. Jerry Brown, a quirk of the California Constitution that requires governors to put someone else in charge whenever they leave the state. Atkins, now the president pro tempore of the state Senate, has filled in as governor a few more times since then, most recently in July when she signed three bills into law and quipped that she was thrilled to once again step into the governor\u2019s shoes, \u201c although I have better shoes. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m very interested in looking at that possibility\u201d of running for governor, Atkins told The Associated Press in an interview, saying publicly for the first time what many have assumed since she announced she would step down as the Senate\u2019s top leader next year. \u201cI am looking at it seriously.\u201d The race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom will likely be a Democratic free-for-all sure to attract the party\u2019s top talent for the chance to lead the nation\u2019s most populous state and the world\u2019s fifth largest economy. California voters have never elected a woman to the governor\u2019s office, nor a person who is openly LGBTQ. And a host of other Democratic candidates are also vying to make history. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the first to formally announce her candidacy just a few months into Newsom\u2019s second term. Tony Thurmond, the Black state superintendent of public instruction, is also in, along with former Controller Betty Yee. Attorney General Rob Bonta, who is Filipino, has said he is seriously considering a run. But Atkins is banking on her experience to give her an edge. That includes a brief stint as mayor of San Diego, one of the nation\u2019s largest cities. And it includes becoming just the third person and first woman ever to hold both of the Legislature\u2019s top jobs: speaker of the Assembly and president pro tempore of the Senate, where she negotiated eight state operating budgets and had her hands in countless major policy decisions. \u201cI sort of feel like I\u2019m addicted to responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cI think experience counts and matters, and I believe I have experience to continue to contribute in some way.\u201d California\u2019s top legislative leaders are some of the most powerful people in the state, but it often doesn\u2019t feel like it. While they negotiate major polices, it\u2019s the governor who gets the attention when the deals are done. That\u2019s especially true for Atkins, who has been a more quiet leader than most. During her tenure as Senate leader, Democrats have grown their caucus to 32 out of 40 seats \u2014 their largest majority since 1883. That majority means there is little incentive to work with Republicans. But Atkins made sure Republicans had their bills heard in public hearings and even pushed for former Republican Leader Shannon Grove to be included in briefings with the Newsom administration. \u201cShe always included us and there was never any surprises. I didn\u2019t agree with what was going on, but we had input and participation,\u201d said Grove, who noted she and Atkins bonded over their impoverished upbringing and a shared love of country music icon Dolly Parton. \u201cShe understands that we represent a portion of Californians as well and we were duly elected and therefore our voices should be heard.\u201d Atkins grew up in rural southwest Virginia, where her dad was a miner and her mother was a seamstress. Her childhood home did not have running water, and some of her earliest memories are of walking down a hill with her twin sister to fetch water from a spring to use for cooking and doing laundry. As a young lesbian in Appalachia, Atkins dreamed of moving to California. She got her chance when her twin sister joined the Navy and was stationed in San Diego. Atkins moved there to help care for her sister\u2019s young son, and never left. In San Diego, Atkins was director of a women\u2019s health clinic that performed abortions. She was also politically active, working to help elect Christine Kehoe to the San Diego City Council. Kehoe hired Atkins to work for her, and then urged her to run for her seat when Kehoe was elected to the state Assembly. \u201cToni is not the kind of person that wants to be the smartest person in the room. She wants to be the most helpful and effective person in the room. And oftentimes she is,\u201d Kehoe said. Atkins followed her mentor to the state Legislature in 2010, where she soon found herself in a contentious race for speaker against Anthony Rendon of Los Angeles. Atkins won, but left after two years to run for the Senate. It wasn\u2019t long before Atkins was selected by her colleagues to lead the state Senate, forcing her to work with Rendon, who had replaced her as speaker in the Assembly. Their relationship was rough at times, but fruitful for Democrats. Their partnership expanded Medicaid to include all eligible adults regardless of immigration status and free meals for public school students. \u201cWe had problems, but I think it was, you know, related more to ambition than anything and, you know, probably to an extent immaturity on my part, too,\u201d said Rendon, who plans to run for state treasurer in 2026. \u201cToni Atkins is a very forgiving person. I have not always been the easiest person to deal with. But she, you know, kept coming back and trying to forge a relationship.\u201d Atkins said she is most proud of the policies that were inspired by her impoverished upbringing, including helping implement the federal Affordable Care Act and creating a tax credit for poor families worth several hundred dollars. Those wins are part of what\u2019s driving her potential run for governor, too. \u201cI see what you can do when you\u2019re in that role,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is something about being at the table.\u201d ",

        "title": "Rep. George Santos won't seek re-election following scathing House Ethics report",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Embattled Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., said Thursday he will not seek re-election next year after the House Ethics Committee released a scathing report that concluded there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d he \u201cviolated federal criminal laws,\u201d including using campaign funds for personal purposes and filing false campaign reports. \"I will continue on my mission to serve my constituents up until I am allowed. I will however NOT be seeking re-election for a second term in 2024 as my family deserves better than to be under the gun from the press all the time,\" Santos said in a statement on X. In its wide-ranging 56-page report, the Ethics subcommittee tasked with investigating Santos found \"a complex web of unlawful activity involving Representative Santos\u2019 campaign, personal, and business finances. Representative Santos sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.\" \"He blatantly stole from his campaign. He deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign but were in fact payments for his personal benefit. He reported fictitious loans to his political committees to induce donors and party committees to make further contributions to his campaign\u2014and then diverted more campaign money to himself as purported 'repayments' of those fictitious loans,\" the report continues. Santos \"used his connections to high-value donors and other political campaigns\" to enrich himself, the report contends. \"And he sustained all of this through a constant series of lies to his constituents, donors, and staff about his background and experience,\" it says. In addition, the report says Santos was \u201cfrequently in debt, had an abysmal credit score, and relied on an ever-growing wallet of high-interest credit cards to fund his luxury spending habits.\" He also made large cash deposits that he has not accounted for and made nearly a quarter-million dollars in cash withdrawals for unknown purposes, the report alleges. Specifically, the Ethics panel detailed a host of suspicious campaign expenditures it said did not appear to have a \u201ccampaign nexus.\u201d They included spending at Herm\u00e8s and Ferragamo stores and on an Airbnb while Santos was on a Hamptons weekend getaway, Botox treatments and OnlyFans, a subscription-based site often used to host pornography. The Ethics Committee said it is referring its findings, including \"uncharged\" conduct, to the Justice Department. It did not make a recommendation to the House. The damning report has revived bipartisan efforts to oust Santos from office. Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss., plans to file a resolution to expel him from Congress on Friday morning, a spokesman confirmed. And Democrats, including Reps. Dan Goldman of New York and Robert Garcia of California, said they would file their own expulsion resolutions. Santos easily survived an effort to expel him this month; 179 members voted in favor of expulsion and 213 against, and 19 voted present. A high threshold \u2014 two-thirds of lawmakers \u2014 is needed to remove him from the House. But a handful of Democrats and Republicans who voted against expulsion last time, arguing that Santos deserved due process, now say they would vote to remove him based on the evidence in the report. They include Reps. Jeff Jackson, D-N.C., Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, and Ken Buck, R-Colo. \"Rep. Santos has received his due process. This report is fully damning. I will vote to expel him,\" Jackson said. Santos\u2019 fellow New York Republicans, many of them moderates who face tough re-election bids next year, had led the charge to expel him. On Thursday, they reiterated their calls for him to resign or be expelled. \u201cGeorge Santos should end this farce and resign immediately,\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who is in his first term, like Santos, said on X. \u201cIf he refuses, he must be removed from Congress. His conduct is not only unbecoming and embarrassing, it is criminal.\u201d The Ethics report \u201cis in alignment with my long held belief that this fraudster has no place serving in the People\u2019s House,\u201d Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito, R-N.Y., said in a statement, \u201cand I once again call on my colleagues to join me in advocating for George Santos\u2019 expulsion from Congress.\u201d The Justice Department has already charged Santos with multiple federal counts, including identity theft, money laundering and theft of public funds. He is set to go on trial in September and has pleaded not guilty. A former campaign fundraiser for Santos, Sam Miele, pleaded guilty to wire fraud Tuesday. In his plea, Miele acknowledged having posed as former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's chief of staff while he was trying to raise money for Santos. He also admitted that he charged donors' credit cards without authorization for contributions to Santos' campaign. He did not implicate Santos in his plea, and his attorney would not say whether he is cooperating with the federal investigation into Santos. Santos' former campaign treasurer Nancy Marks also pleaded guilty last month to charges that did implicate him in wrongdoing, including falsifying campaign forms so he could get matching funds he was not entitled to. Information from Marks, who was Santos' treasurer in his 2020 and 2022 campaigns, was used for last month's superseding indictment against Santos. The Ethics panel's report refers to numerous emails and text exchanges between the pair, which it said indicate that Santos was well aware of the scheme. Santos, 35, has rejected calls for his resignation, but it has been clear that months of media scrutiny, political pressure and mounting legal problems have been taking a personal toll on the freshman fabulist. \u201cI will remain steadfast in fighting for my rights and for defending my name in the face of adversity,\" Santos said Thursday on X. \"I am humbled yet again and reminded that I am human and I have flaws, but I will not stand by as I am stoned by those who have flaws themselves.\" The Ethics Committee said that Santos did not cooperate with the probe and that he provided only limited responses that included \"misstatements\" and \"falsehoods.\" Ethics investigators said they opted not to subpoena Santos, determining that doing so could have delayed their probe and that his testimony would have \"low evidentiary value given his admitted practice of embellishment.\u201d Led by Reps. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, and Susan Wild, D-Pa., the subcommittee met nine times, authorized 37 subpoenas and 43 voluntary requests for information, and received over 172,000 pages of documents. The report said Santos did cooperate in response to one aspect of the investigation concerning allegations that he had sexually harassed someone seeking a job in his congressional office. Santos provided a \u201crobust response\u201d to the allegations, and the person\u2019s testimony contradicted that of other witnesses, undermining his credibility, the report said. The Ethics subcommittee \u201cfinds no substantial reason to believe Santos sexually harassed or discriminated against a prospective employee,\u201d the report said.

        "title": "Justice Department launches hub to help jails improve conditions and safety",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has launched a new program to assist jail administrators across the country improve safety and standards. The Jails and Justice Support Center (JJSC) has a mission of assisting jails \"in creating and sustaining safe, humane, and effective environments\" by working directly with jails to provide training and technical assistance, as well as providing referrals to other federal programs. Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, told NBC News in an interview that the department felt it was important to partner with law enforcement figures in the field and that the initiative is a reflection of what sheriffs and jail administrators said they need. Jails are \"at the front lines\" of some of society's most difficult issues, Gupta said, adding that the smallest jails often need the most assistance. The Justice Department has the ability to investigate individual jails when they find patterns and practices that violate constitutional rights. But the Jails and Justice Support Center is akin to preventative medicine, aimed at trying to proactively help jail administrators deal with issues on the front end, rather than investigating them on the back end. The project is modeled after the Collaborative Reform Initiative \u2014 a DOJ effort launched during the Obama administration in the wake of the unrest in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, after the 2014 death of Michael Brown and in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray \u2014 as well as the Law Enforcement Knowledge Lab, which DOJ launched last year. Gupta, a progressive civil rights attorney who received support from major law enforcement organizations during her 2021 nomination, announced the launch of the hub at an event at the Arlington County Sheriff's Office in Virginia on Wednesday. Ahead of the launch, Gupta told NBC News that a comprehensive approach in collaboration with jail administrators would be most effective and help deal with a variety of issues faced by law enforcement, including the recruitment and retention crisis that particularly affects some of the lower-paying law enforcement jobs at jails. Gupta said what they heard from the field was that jails needed \"real-time best practices and technical assistance.\" Jail leaders and DOJ have the same goal, she said, \"which is safe facilities where the dignity, humanity, constitutional rights of everyone \u2014 and that covers people who are incarcerated, the staff, people who are visiting jails \u2014 are upheld and honored.\" It's similar to the work DOJ has done on policing, Gupta said. \u201cThere will be a lot of learning from consent decrees, but also from sheriffs that are doing very innovative work around substance use disorders, use of Medicaid dollars to better help transition people who are leaving their facilities into community-based treatment, addressing the needs of people with behavioral and mental health disorders and practices that keep staff and incarcerated people safe,\u201d she said. \u201cSheriffs are the first to tell you that they have been saddled with some of these really difficult social problems and that jails are at the frontlines of some of these difficult issues.\u201d Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "In a New York court, Democrats seek a redo after their bungled gerrymander",
        "content": "New York's top court will soon decide whether to allow the state's congressional map to be redrawn for a third time this decade, as Democrats seek to eke out more favorable political boundary lines before the 2024 elections. Democratic lawmakers in the state bungled a gerrymander last year, passing maps that so significantly boosted their congressional prospects that state courts tossed them in favor of a court-drawn map. Now, Democrats are hoping to get a new set of maps approved. During a hearing Wednesday in Buffalo, Aria Branch, an attorney from the Democratic election firm Elias Law Group, argued on behalf of a group of New York voters that the state\u2019s Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) had failed voters when it did not produce maps and must be reconvened for another attempt. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, filed briefs in support of the petition. \u201cThe IRC has never been held to account for its failure,\u201d Branch said Wednesday. Republicans have asked the court to leave the current map in place, pointing to the Democratic Legislature\u2019s ability to overrule the commission. \u201cThe worst-case scenario \u2014 the one that\u2019s completely out of bounds \u2014 is to have a mid-decade redistricting by the Legislature, regardless of whether the IRC is involved. That\u2019s a recipe for another festival of gerrymandering,\u201d attorney Misha Tseytlin said, arguing on behalf of the Republican voters who challenged the Democrats' first map. The Independent Redistricting Commission deadlocked last year, making way for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to step in with a congressional map that was expected to elect just four Republicans in the state\u2019s 26 districts. The court-ordered map implemented in its place, coupled with strong Republican turnout, elected 11 Republicans and 15 Democrats in 2022. The U.S. House is currently controlled by Republicans, who have a slim eight-seat majority. Democrats have invested heavily in challenging Republican gerrymanders elsewhere across the country. Two years into this decade\u2019s redistricting cycle \u2014 triggered by the 2020 census results \u2014 a significant portion of the nation\u2019s maps remain unsettled, with eight states mired in litigation. Florida, Georgia and Louisiana have had their maps struck down by courts and are in the process of redrawing them. In Alabama, after the U.S. Supreme Court had weighed in, the U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama last month ordered that a new, court-drawn map with a second Black opportunity district be put into place. New maps in those four states \u2014 all Republican gerrymanders \u2014 are likely to create four new minority districts, which are wins for Democrats who are reliably the preferred candidates of Southern voters of color. John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said he prefers to focus on fair maps, but politically he expects Democrats will come out on top in this cycle. \u201cVoters, especially voters across the South, will have their voices heard in 2024 in a way they certainly haven\u2019t been in a really long time, specifically Black voters,\u201d he said. The political gains for Democrats, however, were undermined by Republicans in North Carolina who redrew the state\u2019s congressional map after the top state court \u2014 newly controlled by the GOP \u2014 reversed a prior ruling against partisan gerrymandering. A similar redrawing in New York could reverse those losses, but in Buffalo, some on the seven-judge panel appeared skeptical Wednesday of Democrats' arguments, asking why the courts should weigh in further when they had made no plans to allow another redrawing process last year. \u201cDo you find it odd that this high court would decide that, you know what, let\u2019s leave this topic and this state unmoored, so that they\u2019re at their own devices to figure out what happens after 2022?\u201d said Judge Madeline Singas, a Democrat. Other judges appeared skeptical of an effort to redraw the maps now, rather than demanding the IRC be reconvened last spring after it had failed and the legislature stepped in. \u201cThe top of your argument is that you\u2019ve come here to vindicate the IRC process, which is what was denied,\u201d said Judge Anthony Cannataro, a Democrat. \u201cSo it seems you want to have it both ways. You want the IRC process, or do you just want a set of maps that complies or confirms to what you think the maps should be?\u201d Jane C. Timm is a senior reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Democratic lawmakers press Biden on Israeli violence in the West Bank",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two Democratic lawmakers wrote to President Joe Biden on Thursday to ask him to keep pressing Israel to crack down on violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. \"As your administration tirelessly works to prevent the expansion of this conflict, we write to specifically highlight the threat that violence in the West Bank \u2014 especially vigilante violence by Israeli settlers \u2014 poses to those efforts, Israel\u2019s near-term security, Palestinian human rights, and long-term regional peace,\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., wrote in a letter first obtained by NBC News. Goldman and Booker, the only two lawmakers who were in Israel during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, argue that violence by settlers undermines the Palestinian Authority, which they view as a crucial partner in attempting to unify Gaza and the West Bank as part of an eventual peace plan that establishes a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \u201cWe strongly believe that a two-state solution remains the only genuine option to achieve a just, secure, and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cHowever, settler violence against Palestinian civilians destroys the very seeds of trust and cooperation needed to make progress toward a two-state outcome and an enduring peace in the region.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Israeli violence against Palestinians in the West Bank is one of the issues straining the relationship between the U.S. and Israel, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month that the incidents are \"unacceptable,\" according to the State Department. The lawmakers, both Biden allies with strong ties to Israel, appear to be bolstering his position at a delicate moment for his domestic politics and his relationship with Netanyahu. The letter falls well short of the cease-fire that some Democratic members of Congress and many progressive activists want the U.S. to seek. But the request to pressure Israel to police its own people in the West Bank comes amid pro-Palestinian demonstrations aimed at swaying the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers. On Wednesday night, protesters blocked access to the Democratic National Committee, and pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested outside Goldman's Brooklyn office last week when they blocked traffic. In addition to their broader call to pressure Israel about violence in the West Bank, Booker and Goldman specifically ask Biden to ensure that it is not carried out with weapons provided by the U.S. to Israel. \"As the U.S. works to support Israel\u2019s defense, we urge your administration to seek adequate assurances from the Israeli government that any weapons they provide will not be used to perpetuate settler violence in the West Bank,\" they wrote.

        "content": "Police said they evacuated the area around the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, D.C., after making arrests at a chaotic pro-Palestinian rally Wednesday night. U.S. Capitol Police said on X that a \"large group of illegal protesters...have cleared out, but USCP officers will stay on scene out of an abundance of caution.\" They previously put the number of demonstrators at about 150 and said they were \"violently protesting in the area.\" Six officers were treated for injuries as a result of the demonstration, and one person was arrested and accused of assault on an officer, Capitol Police said on X. Capitol Police said in a separate notice to reporters that they had restricted entry and exit to the nearby House office buildings. \"We\u2019re monitoring the situation outside the DNC and are in touch with USCP and Metro Police, who are directing the security response,\" A DNC spokesperson said in a statement. Numerous lawmakers were in the DNC headquarters when the protest erupted. The top three House Democratic leaders were all inside the DNC headquarters as protests started outside tonight, according to a source familiar with the group of lawmakers attending the DNC event.  Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar were in the building with other Democrats for a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) candidate week leadership reception, according to a source familiar with the group of lawmakers attending the DNC event.  The source did not say how long the lawmakers were inside. Spokespeople for Jeffries and Aguilar would not comment on members in attendance, and Clark\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. NBC News has also confirmed that Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Brad Sherman of California and Debbie Dingell of Michigan attended the DCCC candidate week leadership reception.  Capitol Police said that all lawmakers were moved from the area for their safety. IfNotNow, a group that describes itself as \u201cAmerican Jews organizing our community to end U.S. support for Israel\u2019s apartheid system,\u201d said it was at the protest, and accused officers of being violent toward demonstrators. \u201cBREAKING: Police are being extremely violent outside @TheDemocrats headquarters,\u201d the group posted on X. \u201cWe are linking arms, threatening no one, and begging our politicians to support an end to the killing and the suffering in Gaza. Begging, peacefully, for a ceasefire. And this is the response.\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., posted on X that he was evacuated from the DNC \"after pro-terrorist, anti-#Israel protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building.\" NBC News hasn't independently verified Sherman's characterization of the protest. Capitol Police didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on his remark about pepper spray being used on police. The Metropolitan Police Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. IfNotNow spokesperson Eva Borgwardt said in a statement that Sherman's account was inaccurate, adding that the congressman was \" spreading dangerous and reckless misinformation about our nonviolent movement.\" \"Calling hundreds of progressive Jews fighting for peace, many of whom have family members in Israel, 'pro-Hamas' is beyond the pale and the Congressman should apologize for his remarks,\" Borgwardt said. She added that the protest was \"nonviolent\" and a \"moral act of civil disobedience to call on Democrats to support a cease-fire and an end to our government\u2019s funding of violence against Palestinian civilians by Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government.\" Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., posted on X that he was \u201crescued\u201d from the DNC building by \u201carmed officers\u201d who \u201cdid not know the protestors\u2019 intent; they knew only that Members of Congress were inside, could not leave and that protestors would not let police through.\u201d \u201cForcing police to guess intent is irresponsible and dangerous,\u201d Casten added. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters wearing shirts emblazoned with \"CEASE FIRE NOW\" clashing with officers on the steps of the DNC, who appeared to be working to remove demonstrators from the scene. The protest comes a day after thousands gathered in Washington for a March for Israel rally against antisemitism. The security level for Tuesday's event was raised to the highest designation. There were no immediate reports of arrests or counterdemonstrations. Rebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "The Republican presidential primary campaign is heavy on bloodlust",
        "content": "Republican presidential hopefuls are out for blood \u2014 literally. Former President Donald Trump wants shoplifters shot in their tracks. He recently lamented that former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley couldn\u2019t be put to death for assuaging China\u2019s concerns following the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. In his last year as president, he revived and expanded the federal death penalty \u2014 allowing for firing squads to be used in certain states \u2014 and now he wants to execute child traffickers. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Harvard Law graduate who served as a lawyer in the Navy, promises to kill suspected drug smugglers crossing the Mexican border. Without investigation, arrest or trial, he has said, they will end up \u201cstone cold dead\u201d if he\u2019s elected president. In Florida, he has broadened the death penalty so that people who commit heinous crimes short of homicide \u2014 such as sexual battery against children \u2014 can be executed. And he backed legislation offering immunity to people who run over protesters with their vehicles. At last week\u2019s GOP presidential primary debate, DeSantis\u2019 message to Israel about how it should respond to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack was simple: \u201cFinish the job once and for all with these butchers, Hamas.\u201d Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley had an even shorter but similarly clear message: \u201cFinish them.\u201d Haley, like DeSantis, has said she would send U.S. special forces into Mexico to \u201celiminate\u201d drug cartels. The Haley and DeSantis campaigns didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment. \u201cThe escalation in violent language reflects the escalation in ostensible dangers posed by the threats manufactured to stoke the fears of the MAGA base,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida Republican operative who has become a vocal anti-Trump voice. Irrespective of the advisability, practicality or legality of the various proposals, they suggest the candidates believe voters will reward them for a particular trait: bloodlust.  That\u2019s especially true when it comes to a set of issues that animate the Republican base in the Trump era \u2014 crime, illegal immigration and trafficking of drugs and children \u2014 creating a race among the hopefuls to outmuscle one another. Even when they aren\u2019t calling for the killing of suspects and criminals in the U.S. or targets in other countries, the top candidates are taking hawkish positions on those issues. In an interview with The New York Times, longtime Trump adviser Stephen Miller previewed what he called a \u201cblitz\u201d to thwart illegal immigration in a prospective second Trump administration.  \u201cAny activists who doubt President Trump\u2019s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe immigration legal activists won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has failed to gain much traction in the polls, criticized Trump and DeSantis in remarks at the Hudson Institute in Washington on Wednesday, pointing specifically to Trump\u2019s recent formulation that his domestic political critics are \u201cvermin\u201d who are more of a threat to national security than foreign enemies. Christie said Trump\u2019s rhetoric echoes the propaganda of the Nazis. Moreover, Christie suggested DeSantis is mimicking Trump with his own violent rhetoric. One example Christie pointed to: DeSantis\u2019 pledge to \u201cstart slitting throats\u201d of federal bureaucrats \u201con Day 1\u201d of his administration \u2014 which DeSantis later said was simply a \u201cfigure of speech\u201d he used to draw attention to his effort to downsize the government. \u201cWhen Ron DeSantis thinks it sounds tough, saying he\u2019s going to slit the throats of bureaucrats or shoot immigrants stone cold dead at the border, use the United States army to invade Mexico, [it] is fundamentally unserious,\u201d Christie said in a speech at the conservative think tank. \u201cThis is TV tough-guy talk, which he learned from his mentor, Donald Trump.\u201d  Responding to this article, Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said it\u2019s actually Democrats who have called for violence \u201cagainst President Trump and his supporters.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is the law and order candidate, while liberals like [President Joe] Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Ayanna Pressley, Maxine Watters, and Jon Tester have riled up their supporters to foment dangerous unrest,\u201d he said. But Biden\u2019s campaign pointed right back at the GOP.  \u201cMAGA Republicans don\u2019t have a positive vision to run on, so they resort to violent rhetoric and fanning the flames of division,\u201d campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said. \u201cWith no vision and deeply unpopular policies, they know the only way to win is by tearing the country apart. President Biden ran in 2020 to restore the soul of the nation and bring us together \u2014 and that\u2019s why he got more votes than any presidential candidate in American history. Americans will once again reject Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans\u2019 hateful and divisive message next November.\u201d The top candidates for the GOP nomination, who portray the push toward more violent policy outcomes as an attempt to restore \u201claw and order,\u201d have all signed on to an idea gaining steam more broadly in the party that military force should be used against Mexican drug cartels, in large part to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. The issue of border security has always been a go-to in Republican politics, but in recent months party leaders have started framing it in more overtly violent terms. \u201cWhen it comes to the cartels, we should treat them like the terrorists that they are,\u201d Haley told Fox News in August. \u201cI would send in special operations there and eliminate them just like we eliminated ISIS and make sure they know there\u2019s no place for them.\u201d But they have also been walking a tightrope as they try to appeal to voters\u2019 desire for demonstrations of strength while respecting the base\u2019s wariness of sending American troops into battle. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is polling behind Trump, DeSantis and Haley, less regularly invokes that kind of bellicose rhetoric \u2014 but he has also veered into especially gruesome territory. \u201cI would love nothing more than for the IDF to put the heads of the top 100 Hamas leaders on stakes and line them up on the Israel-Gaza border,\u201d Ramaswamy said last month in a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Summit, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Trump, who is leading the field by dozens of points in national polling and state-by-state surveys, often notes that he didn\u2019t enter the U.S. into any new wars during his term as president. A national GOP strategist said DeSantis and Haley try to one-up Trump\u2019s rhetoric but asserted that Trump tends to be more restrained in his commentary when it comes to foreign wars. \"Nikki Haley especially and DeSantis, to some extent, have a hawkish instinct that comes out when they speak like this. Whereas Trump [says] al-Baghdadi \u2018died like a dog,\u2019 and he says savage stuff, but he seems to have less of the bloodthirsty instinct that it sounds like when they speak like this,\" the source said. This person added that such rhetoric actually may not play well with Republican voters who seek to stay out of foreign entanglements because it comes across \u201clike you\u2019re a little too comfortable with the warfare.\u201d Trump supported the idea of launching missiles into Mexico to combat cartels as early as 2020, according to a memoir written by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and DeSantis has said the U.S. should use \u201cdeadly force\u201d against migrants suspected of bringing drugs across the border. For DeSantis, like Trump, it\u2019s the latest in long line of examples of policy and rhetoric being framed by an eagerness for violence or, in some cases, death. Most notably, as DeSantis was gearing up to run for president early this year, he got large Republican majorities in the Florida Legislature to pass a measure making child rapists eligible for the death penalty even if their victims don't die. The measure directly contradicts U.S. Supreme Court rulings that found it is unconstitutional to sentence someone to death for a crime less than homicide. DeSantis at the time said he hoped the new Florida law would give the Supreme Court an opportunity to set a precedent expanding the death penalty. \u201cIn Florida, we believe it\u2019s only appropriate that the worst of the worst crimes deserve the worst of the worst punishment,\u201d he said.  Another law signed by DeSantis gets rid of a requirement that jurors must agree unanimously that someone deserves the death penalty. It allows for the death penalty with 8-4 juries, the lowest standard in the country. Alabama also allows for non-unanimous death penalty sentences, but a 10-2 threshold is required, according to the American Bar Association. The proposals easily passed the Florida Legislature, which was eager to give DeSantis wins ahead of his expected run for president. But the changes did come with pushback from some criminal justice reformers who said they went too far. \u201cWith this new legislation, Florida runs the haunting risk of sentencing more innocent people to death,\u201d Melanie Kalmanson, a member of the American Bar Association\u2019s Death Penalty Representation Project Steering Committee, said when the bill passed. \u201cIn addition, the state will impose sentences of death that are almost certainly unconstitutional.\u201d GOP strategist David Kochel said that to the extent bloodlust is a phenomenon, it\u2019s isolated to Trump.  \u201cI think Trump is a category difference. It\u2019s the brand,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cNobody is really trying to compete with him. He says unhinged things to make liberals in the media lose their minds and attack him. It\u2019s how he optimizes the attention market. The media has fallen for it for eight years.\u201d But a Republican strategist who advised one of the candidates who has already dropped out said the hopefuls are competing with one another to meet the requirements of primary voters. \u201cPeople are angry, and they want action,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the specific promises or policies. It\u2019s about conveying a sense of urgency, anger and action.\u201d Scott Howell, another veteran Republican operative, said some of it is simply a function of primary politics. \u201cIt is a primary. If AOC was in Democratic primary, she would be pulling Joe Biden further to the left,\" Howell said, referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York. \"There is a lot of crap going on right now, and emotions are high,\" he added. \"I think, candidly, a lot of them are just throwing hooks in the water and see what fish they can catch.\" Jonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Washington.

        "title": "Xi and Biden end yearlong silence, finding common ground on AI, fentanyl and military communications",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 President Joe Biden met face to face with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Wednesday and said afterward they had agreed to revive dormant military communication channels, crack down on fentanyl trafficking and work jointly to address rapid advances in artificial intelligence. The four-hour summit broke a yearlong silence marked by rising tensions that have stoked fears that the two countries are on a path toward direct conflict. At a news conference afterward, Biden said, \"I believe they were some of the most productive and constructive discussions we've had.\" Having gone a full year without speaking, much less meeting in person, the two leaders agreed that they could now pick up the phone and call each other directly when needed, Biden said. The summit took place at the 654-acre Filoli estate in Woodside, about 35 miles south of San Francisco, where the two leaders are also taking part in a separate summit meeting of Asian-Pacific nations. After a formal session with top advisers, Xi and Biden met again for a working lunch and later walked the grounds together in front of the cameras. They passed reporters at one point, and in response to a shouted question about how the talks were going, Biden said, \"Well,\" and gave a thumbs-up. There were no breakthroughs, however, on some long-standing issues \u2014 chiefly, the status of Taiwan \u2014 that have soured relations between the world's two largest economic powers. Nor was there any sign that Biden was reassessing his belief that China is a formidable and potentially dangerous competitor. He cautioned that he won't accept Chinese promises to cooperate at face value. When a reporter asked whether he trusted Xi, Biden repeated a phrase former President Ronald Reagan used when he negotiated arms control accords with the old Soviet Union in the 1980s: \"Trust but verify.\" Asked at the news conference whether he saw Xi as a dictator \u2014 the word he used to describe Xi over the summer \u2014 Biden said he did. \u201cHe\u2019s a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is a communist country that\u2019s based on a form of government totally different than ours,\u201d he said. Responding Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry criticized Biden\u2019s remark as \u201cextremely wrong and irresponsible political manipulation.\u201d \"The term came out naturally but also quite undiplomatically given that they just had the summit meeting and the Chinese are particularly sensitive about this,\" Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, said in an email. \"I think Biden might feel more at ease using the term now the meeting is over.\" She added that China will not abandon the agreement at this point but that Biden's remark doesn\u2019t cast a very promising light\" on the future of bilateral relations. Biden said earlier: \"We're in a competitive relationship, China and the United States, but my responsibility is to make this rational and manageable, so it doesn't result in conflict. That's what I'm all about. That's what this is about.\" Still, Biden hailed the three areas in which the sides reached consensus. The U.S. discussed with China a plan to cut down the flow of fentanyl precursors that are contributing to an illegal drug scourge in the U.S., according to a senior administration official who briefed the media pool. \u201cThe president basically said, look, this one of the worst drug problems the United States has ever faced. Tens of thousands of American perishing annually,\" the official said. After close calls between Chinese and American warships and planes, U.S. officials are delighted that China will reopen military communication lines. In announcing the resumption of military-to-military talks, which aim to prevent inadvertent conflict, Biden said \u201cvital miscalculations\u201d can cause \u201creal trouble.\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet with China\u2019s defense minister, once the person is named, the U.S. official said. China\u2019s previous defense minister, Li Shangfu, departed the administration weeks ago. Li had been sanctioned by the U.S. The official also said the countries are establishing \u201coperational engagements,\u201d allowing senior military commanders to engage with counterparts. Taiwan remains a knotty problem for both sides. Xi wants to unify China and Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that China claims as its own. While Biden's \"one China\" policy does not favor Taiwan independence, he has objected to what he sees as aggressive military actions that have menaced Taiwan. Biden asked that China respect Taiwan's electoral process ahead of the island's presidential election in January. In response, Xi argued that peace is \"all well and good\" but that eventually they needed to move toward resolution, the U.S. official said. Hua Chunying, a Chinese official who attended the larger bilateral meeting, said on X that Xi said the \"Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.\" She added that the U.S. should \"support China's peaceful reunification.\" \"China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,\" she said in the post. Biden and Xi greeted each other at 11:15 a.m. local time. As Xi left his limousine, he walked toward the historic country house along a red carpet and was greeted by Biden, who had arrived earlier and was awaiting him in the doorway. The two briefly shook hands and waved to the media corps before they entered the building. Inside, they faced each other across a long rectangular table, with Chinese and American flags at the far end. They were flanked by their respective delegations. Biden sat between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In his opening remarks, Biden said previous meetings between the two leaders have \"always been candid, straightforward and useful.\" He said competition between China and the U.S. must not veer into conflict, a point he has been stressing for months. \"I value our conversation, because I think it\u2019s paramount that you and I understand each other clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication,\u201d Biden said. Xi spoke next. Through an interpreter, he said the two countries have the most important bilateral relationship in the world. \"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\" Xi said. \"It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflicts and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides.\" The summit featured a few lighter moments. Biden will turn 81 on Monday. Xi\u2019s wife shares the same birthdate. When Biden said he wished her a happy birthday, Xi said he had been working so hard that he\u2019d forgotten. He thanked Biden for the reminder, the official said. After the news conference, Biden was scheduled to attend an evening reception in San Francisco for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders, which Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden will also attend. The summit is the first time the two presidents have met since a three-hour session on the sidelines of a summit in Bali, Indonesia, a year ago. The visit is also the first time Xi has stepped foot in the U.S. since 2017. In the hours before the meeting, John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, told reporters: \u201cI think we\u2019re all expecting that this will be a productive discussion today. And hopefully, a precursor to much more communication and dialogue between our two teams going forward.\u201d Over the past year, relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated in ways that elevate the risk of an unwanted confrontation, U.S. officials said. As an example, when the Biden administration shot down a Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. in February, the Defense Department had no one in China to contact because Beijing had closed an important military communications channel, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Tuesday while previewing the Biden-Xi meeting. \u201cIt is true that when the Chinese spy balloon went across the United States, we had no way to communicate with the Chinese,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s not responsible, and we hope to at least take some preliminary steps\" toward improving communications. U.S. officials believe Biden entered the meeting from a position of strength. While the Chinese economy is struggling with high youth unemployment and disinvestment from foreign companies, Biden has boasted of robust economic growth in the U.S., accompanied by a low jobless rate. After he arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday, Biden attended an evening fundraising event at which he said: \u201cPresident Xi is another example of how re-establishing American leadership in the world is taking hold. They\u2019ve got real problems, folks.\u201d Preparation for the summit was months in the making. In the run-up, Blinken had given priority to resuming military-to-military talks with China, as well as curbing the flow of narcotics into the U.S., according to a U.S. official involved with China policy. Blinken raised the issues directly with Chinese officials four times since his visit to China in June, including with top Xi administration officials like Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi. When Wang visited the U.S., Blinken described a Chinese fighter jet\u2019s close call with a U.S. warplane flying in international airspace over the South China Sea. He noted that the leaders were sitting at a table about 10 feet long \u2014 the distance between the two aircraft during the near-collision, the source said. Blinken used the anecdote to illustrate the risk of an accidental collision and show why the two countries need to revive military communication channels.

        "title": "Biden supporters' New Hampshire write-in campaign risks underscoring the president's vulnerability",
        "content": "CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s push to strip New Hampshire of its prized role at the start of the nominating calendar has left some of his top backers here divided over how to respond. One approach that's gaining momentum \u2014 rallying support for a write-in campaign \u2014 is increasingly seen as a risky proposition that might only serve to underscore Biden's vulnerability heading into the general election. Biden's name will not be on the New Hampshire ballot on Jan. 23. The state decided to skip ahead of the order that the Democratic Party \u2014 and the president \u2014 wanted for the primary calendar. By doing so, it faces sanctions from the Democratic National Committee. To the organizers of a new \u201cWrite-In Joe Biden\u201d campaign, the so-called grassroots effort is a way not just to demonstrate the depth of support for Biden but also to give organizing efforts a test run ahead of the bigger fight to come next November, when New Hampshire\u2019s electoral votes could be crucial. \u201cThis is really about making sure that we have the foundation built so that in November we can carry New Hampshire and get those four electoral votes,\u201d Jim Demers, one of the leaders of the write-in campaign, said in an interview. \u201cA really good, strong showing by the president is critical.\u201d But others fear that the exercise can only fail, either with Biden falling short of the kind of convincing win an incumbent should expect or with Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, the main Democratic challenger whose name is on the ballot, scoring an outright victory on primary day. One such Democrat, who requested anonymity to discuss concerns about Biden\u2019s predicament, referred to historical precedent. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson also was not on the New Hampshire ballot. Though Johnson won nearly 50% of the vote as a write-in candidate, Sen. Eugene McCarthy\u2019s surprisingly strong second-place finish was an ominous signal of Johnson's declining support. Just weeks later, Johnson announced he would not seek a second full term. Phillips hopes history repeats itself. \u201cA relatively unknown Minnesota senator came here in 1968 for very similar reasons \u2014 a president who was very unpopular. Young people completely angry and disenfranchised about their voices\u2019 not being heard as it related to the Vietnam War,\u201d Phillips told NBC News when he was asked about the Biden write-in effort. \u201cI\u2019m in this to win it. I intend to, but if that opens the door to someone who is better able to do it and voters decide that, I will get behind that person in the same way I\u2019m getting behind my campaign.\u201d There is also a third camp \u2014 former backers of Biden who have already defected largely in protest of his primary slight.  \u201cI understand why he wants to run in South Carolina. He owes a lot to that state and its congressional delegation. But I cannot see this idea to write in Joe Biden\u2019s name when he\u2019s basically said, 'I want to do away with your first-in-the-nation primary,'\u201d said Stephen Shurtleff, a former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives whom Biden endorsed in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary. \u201cI look at it as asking us to reward negative behavior.\u201d Biden\u2019s first two presidential campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, did not last long enough for him to compete in the New Hampshire primary. In 2020, fearing another disappointing finish after having stumbled in Iowa, Biden left the state before polls even closed on Election Day to plant his flag in South Carolina. His dominant win there nearly three weeks later was a stunning springboard to the Democratic nomination, a fact that was not lost on Democrats when he rewarded South Carolina with the first voting slot in 2024. New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan made it official Wednesday that his state would hold its primary Jan. 23, defying Biden\u2019s preferred pecking order, which would have forced the state to share its primary date with Nevada. Scanlan\u2019s announcement included some unsubtle jabs at Biden and the Democratic National Committee. He spoke before an array of flags that New Hampshire had carried onto South Carolina battlefields during the Civil War. \u201cWe did not take the first-of-the-nation primary from anyone, and we will vigorously defend it,\u201d Scanlan said. Biden\u2019s campaign says it is not involved in the write-in effort; instead, it said, it is putting its focus on states that are following the DNC's preferred calendar, like South Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris underscored that Friday with a last-minute trip to file Biden\u2019s paperwork in South Carolina personally. Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, downplayed the risks for Biden of staying off New Hampshire\u2019s ballot. \u201cWe always enjoy a robust primary,\u201d said Buckley, who said he has written in Jimmy Carter\u2019s name every four years since he became party chair. \u201cI think that the Democrats in New Hampshire are very excited about writing in Joe Biden. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do. But it\u2019s a long time between now and Jan. 23.\u201d Demers said write-in organizers have seen strong early support for their campaign since they launched it two weeks ago. He said that the group hopes to raise enough money by the primary for staffing and voter education efforts \u2014 but that to be successful it would also need more significant funding for paid advertising. \u201cThere has been talk that there are groups that are interested. So we expect that this grassroots effort will be augmented by independent expenditures, as well,\u201d he said. Demers said the group has another goal in mind: helping convince national Democrats ahead of decisions about the 2028 calendar that New Hampshire deserves its prized early role. \u201cIf New Hampshire voters, New Hampshire Democrats, come out, write in the president, show that they still want to be part of this process, it gives us a story to tell,\u201d he said.

        "title": "'Antiestablishment' activist sought to incite Trump supporters on Jan. 6, DOJ argues",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A man who previously held himself out as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement went to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 with the \"goal of inciting the crowd,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments at his trial Wednesday. John Earle Sullivan, also known as \"Jayden X,\" is a self-purported activist and journalist on trial in Washington, where he faces a host of charges, including felony obstruction of an official proceeding and civil disorder. Sullivan, who recorded the shooting death of rioter Ashli Babbitt after she tried to enter the House Speaker's Lobby through a window broken by the pro-Trump mob, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the right for those seeking to blame \"antifa,\" or left-wing provocateurs, for the violent criminal actions hundreds of rioters undertook during the breach of the Capitol. At trial, government prosecutors portrayed Sullivan as an \"antiestablishment\" grifter and chaos agent \u2014 his company was called Insurgence USA \u2014 who wanted to \"burn it all down\" during the Capitol attack. \u201cI\u2019m gonna side with anyone who is ready to rip this s--- down,\u201d Sullivan said in a quotation cited by prosecutors. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Barclay told jurors during closing arguments Wednesday: \"It does not matter whether Sullivan was holding a camera to record his crimes. He incited the mob at every step. He knew why he was there that day. He wanted to tear it all down.\" Sullivan testified in his own defense, holding himself out as a documentarian just interested in getting the best shot. \"I was only observing,\" Sullivan said in his testimony. \"I followed the crowd. I'm there to document.\" But prosecutors played video after video of Sullivan doing much more than just documenting, including pulling out what they said was a knife as rioters tried to breach the House floor. Sullivan conceded that videos showed that he claimed to have a knife on him, and he conceded to jurors that he took a knife with him on his trip. But he also told jurors that he did not recall whether had the knife with him inside the Capitol, and he said he was not sure whether the knife-looking object he was holding in one of the videos was actually a knife. \"I don't remember bringing a knife specifically,\" Sullivan said. \"I'm not sure if that's a knife.\" Sullivan described his rhetoric from that day as an effort to blend into the crowd. \u201cI say whatever I can to keep myself safe,\u201d he told jurors. Prosecutors presented evidence indicating Sullivan's rhetoric continued long after he left the Capitol. In a call with members of his Discord channel after the riot, Sullivan bragged about being \"on the front line\" and the impact his rhetoric had on the mob. \"I brought my megaphone to instigate s---,\" he said. He said he wanted to \"make those Trump supporters f--- s--- up.\" Sullivan's attorney, Steven Kiersh, argued that his client's \"intent was to film the events that were happening on January 6th\" and that jurors only needed to watch the 50-minute video he recorded inside the Capitol that day for proof. \"That recording of history is for everyone's benefit,\" Kiersh said. Sullivan's heated rhetoric, Kiersh argued, was \"just words\" that had no meaning, with the goal of helping him blend in with the crowd. \"His intent was not to burn the place down,\" Kiersh argued, noting that Sullivan did not have matches or lighter fluid on him. \"His intent was to film.\" Citing a video in which Sullivan said he was recording only to keep himself from getting arrested, prosecutors said the recording was only \"a ploy\" for Sullivan to provide cover for his true goal of inciting the mob. \"Everything that came out of his mouth was a ploy,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Lederer told jurors, referring to Sullivan's testimony. The only thing more offensive than his testimony, she said, was his \"request for you to believe it.\" \"He came to engage in chaos,\" she added. The government found that Sullivan \u201creceived at least $90,875 in payments from at least six companies\u201d \u2014 including NBC News \u2014 for the rights to his Capitol video, and it seized more than $62,000 from his accounts. About 1,200 defendants have been arrested in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and about 400 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration. Jurors are expected to begin deliberating Thursday morning in Sullivan's trial. Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Lawyer for Trump co-defendant in Georgia case admits leaking witness videos",
        "content": "An attorney for one of former President Donald Trump's co-defendants in the Fulton County district attorney's 2020 election interference case admitted at a hearing Wednesday that he had shared witness proffer videos of key figures in the case with a media outlet, saying he thought it was in his client's interest to do so. Jonathan Miller, an attorney for Misty Hampton, made the confession during an emergency hearing for a protective order that was prompted by the publication of parts of the video statements of Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro and Scott Hall by ABC News and The Washington Post. The judge said he would issue a protective order barring the disclosure of certain discovery information by Thursday morning. Powell, Ellis, Chesebro and Hall were among the original 18 defendants charged alongside former President Donald Trump in the racketeering case in August. All four have pleaded guilty to related charges. The proffer videos were made pursuant to their plea agreements, which required that they provide true and accurate information to prosecutors. The videos showed Ellis recounting a conversation with Trump adviser Dan Scavino in which he told her that Trump would not leave the White House regardless of the election results, and Powell testifying that Trump was repeatedly told by others that he\u2019d lost the election. \"In being transparent with the court and to make sure that nobody else gets blamed for what happened and so that I can go to sleep well tonight, judge, I did release those videos to one outlet,\" Miller told Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee during the hearing. \"In all candor to the court, I need the court to know that,\" he said. Asked why he'd done so, he noted that while the four's guilty pleas were public, \"to hide those proffers, that show all the underlying things went into those pleas, it misleads the public about what's going on.\" He said two of the defendants \"were directly related to my client. And I don\u2019t believe that either one of those hurt my client. If anything, I believe they help my client and the public needs to know that.\u201d \"The public has a right to know,\" he added. Miller did not name the defendants related to his client, but Hampton is charged with a scheme to access voting machines in Coffee County, which Powell and Hall were charged with as well. In her proffer video, Powell distanced herself from the plot while Hall identified another person as being part of the \"brain trust\" behind the plan, according to the Washington Post report. The DA's office argued in court filings that a protective order was necessary \"in order to protect witnesses and to safeguard sensitive and confidential information\" during the discovery process. It said the leaks were \"clearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case, subjecting them to harassment and threats prior to trial.\" Tom Clyde, an attorney for a coalition of media organizations that did not include NBC News, urged the judge not to issue a protective order. \u201cEssentially what the state and the defendants are trying to do is get the authority of the court behind an order that will impose secrecy on information that is exchanged during the discovery process. Notwithstanding how newsworthy that information is, notwithstanding how much it might inform the public about the circumstances of this case, but particularly in this case, the circumstances of an election that took place, that\u2019s extremely significant in public importance,\u201d Clyde said. The judge said he was mindful of Clyde's First Amendment concerns, but disagreed with his arguments. \u201cUntil we decide what\u2019s going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,\u201d he said. \"We've already seen what may happen when a protective order is not in place.\" In a separate filing Wednesday, the DA's office urged the court to revoke the bond of defendant Harrison Floyd, the former head of Black Voices for Trump, arguing that he had violated the conditions of his release. The DA's office said that Floyd had \"publicly tweeted multiple times\" this month in an effort to \"intimidate codefendants and witnesses, to communicate directly and indirectly with codefendants and witnesses, and to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice.\" An attorney for Floyd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "title": "Divisive megachurch pastor draws criticism for role at March for Israel",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A controversial televangelist's role as a guest speaker at a large-scale rally Tuesday in support of Israel and against Jewish hate drew mounting criticism as his past remarks about Jews \u2014 widely denounced as antisemitic \u2014 resurfaced. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement Wednesday that Pastor John Hagee\u2019s history of \"Islamophobia and antisemitism\" should have prevented him from speaking at the March for Israel on the National Mall in Washington. Follow live updates here \"Hypocrisy does not begin to describe the decision by pro-Israel groups to invite an antisemite to speak at a rally against antisemitism after they spent weeks falsely accusing every pro-Palestine march of being antisemitic,\" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the council's national deputy director. Mitchell also called on the bipartisan delegation of political leaders who spoke at the rally, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to \"renounce his bigotry.\" \"Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism are unacceptable. Period,\" Mitchell said. \"So is antisemitism, regardless of whether an antisemite like John Hagee supports the Israeli government.\" Spokespeople for Schumer, Johnson and Jeffries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hagee, 83, also could not immediately be reached for comment through Christians United for Israel, which he founded in 2006 and which bills itself as \"the largest pro-Israel organization in the United States.\" He has courted controversy over the decades, having received fallout following a 2005 sermon posted online in which he suggested God allowed Adolf Hitler to carry out the Holocaust to allow Jews to ultimately return to Israel. Hagee later denied that he condoned Hitler or the Holocaust. The response from CAIR, the country's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, follows remarks from Jewish leaders who spoke in support of the rally but sought to distance themselves from Hagee even before he took the stage Tuesday afternoon. \"Contrary to what I was told, Pastor John Hagee will be speaking at today's rally,\" Hadar Susskind, the president of Americans for Peace Now, a nonprofit peace advocacy group, posted on social media. \"I am horrified that he was given this platform. His history of hateful comments should disqualify him from decent company, much less from speaking on stage. He is not welcome and should not speak.\" Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T'ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization based in New York City, wrote on social media that progressive groups that support Israel \"knew this rally wouldn't represent our values,\" in part because Hagee was included. The Jewish Federations of North America, an event organizer, declined to comment Wednesday. Organizers had seen the March for Israel as a way to show unity among Jewish Americans after the Oct. 7 ambush by Hamas in Israel, which killed 1,200 people and led to about 240 being taken hostage. The conflict overseas has also prompted a surge in antisemitism and bias incidents in the U.S., according to the Anti-Defamation League, with CAIR finding a similar uptick of threats reported by Palestinian Americans and Muslims. The Washington rally attracted a wide variety of viewpoints among participants about Israel's actions in Gaza after the attack, with some in staunch support of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others questioning his policies while also arguing Israel must defend itself against terrorism. Hagee was invited to speak under a section of the program called \"Voices of Allies,\" which included Anila Ali, a Pakistani American Muslim and women's rights activist. Hagee, who founded the nondenominational evangelical Cornerstone Church and a television ministry in San Antonio, has regularly used world events to link his claims of biblical prophecy. In 2008, he gained attention for endorsing Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona for president. The move drew criticism from the Catholic League, a Catholic civil rights group, which has described Hagee as an \"anti-Catholic bigot.\" Hagee later said he regretted comments he made about the Catholic church, and he also walked back previous remarks in which he said Hurricane Katrina was punishment for the LGBTQ community, PolitiFact reported. A Huffington Post report examining Hagee's comments about Hitler and Jews brought further criticism; Hagee had said in a sermon that \"God sent a hunter\" and that Jews were killed \"because God said my top priority for the Jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of Israel.\" McCain ultimately rejected Hagee\u2019s endorsement, leading Hagee to say he was misrepresented and tired of \u201cbaseless attacks.\u201d Hagee faced controversy again in 2014, when the ADL called on him to apologize after he said Barack Obama was \"one of the most antisemitic presidents in the history of the United States of America.\" Over the years, he has remained a prominent figure among conservative Republicans, becoming an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump and recently hosting Republican presidential candidates loyal to Israel at his organization's annual summit. At the March for Israel, Hagee was pointed about his continuing support for the Jewish people and Israel's resilience. \"Israel,\" he said, \"you are not alone today, tomorrow or forever.\" Erik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.

        "title": "Group of Democrats urges Biden and Blinken to support a cease-fire in Gaza",
        "content": "Two dozen Democratic lawmakers signed a letter Wednesday urging President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to seek a cease-fire in Gaza.  The letter \u2014 signed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Betty McCollum of Minnesota, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and 21 others, many of whom are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2014 said that the lawmakers were concerned about the intensifying war in Gaza, \"particularly grave violations against children, and our fear that without an immediate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a robust bilateral ceasefire, this war will lead to a further loss of civilian life.\" \"We write urging clarity on your strategic objectives for achieving deescalation and stability in the region,\" the Democrats wrote. \"We understand that the Administration has serious concerns regarding the objectives and consequences of a large-scale ground offensive, and we urge you to press this case directly.\" Their letter came as Israel expanded its ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, with the country's military launching a raid on Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip's main hospital, in what it has described as a \"targeted operation\" against Hamas. More than 1.6 million people have been displaced in Gaza, and health officials there say more than 11,200 have been killed. Israel says 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, with 239 people still held hostage in Gaza. In a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Oct. 12 and 13, about 68% of respondents said they agreed with the statement: \"Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate.\" \u201cWe reaffirm our unequivocal condemnation of the Hamas attacks on Israel that took place on October 7th, in which Hamas killed over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, and captured over 200 hostages,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter. \u201cWe also share dire concerns with the ongoing Israeli response, in which the Israeli Defense Forces have killed over 11,078 Palestinians, nearly half of whom have been children.\u201d They added: \u201cWe thank the President for calling for a humanitarian pause so that humanitarian aid may flow and diplomacy may take place. However, given the present lack of an apparent and clear strategic plan, we encourage a redoubling of efforts to achieve rapid de-escalation through a ceasefire and robust, regional engagement that includes international humanitarian organizations.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Democrats\u2019 letter. On Tuesday, 400 employees of Biden\u2019s own administration signed a similar letter, calling for the president to pursue a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.  McCollum said in a statement that \u201cit has been deeply disturbing to see children continue to bear the awful toll of this war.\u201d According to a recent Associated Press-NORC survey, while nearly 70% of Democrats approved of Biden\u2019s job performance overall, the number dropped to 50% when it comes to his handling of the conflict in Gaza.

        "title": "Ethics report on Rep. George Santos won't make recommendations for House action",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Ethics Committee will release its report on Rep. George Santos before the end of the week, but it won't offer any recommendations for what members should do about the scandal-plagued Republican, the panel's chair said Wednesday. \"We are not going to make any recommendations to the House,\u201d said Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss. \u201cThat will be up to each individual member as to whether they feel like the information that\u2019s obtained in the report, that is available in the public domain, rises to the level of expulsion.\u201d Guest added that issuing a report recommending sanctions would have delayed the investigation into next year. The bipartisan committee had vowed to release the results of its investigation by Friday. Santos, of New York, said it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to discuss the pending report about him. \u201cLike I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m staying in office,\u201d he said Wednesday. New York Republicans who led a failed effort this month to expel Santos, however, were clear that they still want to see him gone no matter what the report says. \u201cI would certainly support expulsion again,\u201d said Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., called Santos \"a fraud.\" \"He should not be a member of Congress,\" Molinaro said. \"I called for his resignation. I forwarded a vote to expel. I think this report, however, will give other members the opportunity to reflect, to affirm and confirm what we know.\" Santos faces multiple federal charges, including wire fraud, identity theft, money laundering, lying to Congress and theft of public funds. He has pleaded not guilty and is set to go to trial in September. He and many other Republicans have argued that his future should be up to voters to decide, despite the many fabrications on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before he was elected to Congress. The vote to expel him two weeks ago failed, 179-213, with 19 members voting present. Some said they were waiting to see the Ethics Committee's report before they made determinations about Santos\u2019 future. Guest said that while he opposes expelling members of Congress, he expects that another motion to expel Santos will come up after the Ethics Committee report is released. Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito, R-N.Y., who authored the last expulsion resolution, promised as much when it failed. \u201cIn two weeks, we will read the ethics report, and, you know, you don\u2019t need to be a retired New York City detective to understand that the report is probably not going to be good, and we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d he said at the time. The House left town Wednesday afternoon for the Thanksgiving recess and will return Nov. 28. Kyle Stewart is an associate producer covering Congress for NBC News. ",

        "title": "N.H. sets presidential primary date for Jan. 23, defying Biden\u2019s new primary order",
        "content": "CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 New Hampshire on Wednesday announced Jan. 23 as the date of its presidential primary, setting up the second GOP contest of 2024 eight days after the Iowa caucuses \u2014 and defying President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s plans to give South Carolina the party\u2019s first primary contest. The move means the Granite State will remain first on the primary calendar, but it faces punishment from the DNC, including but not limited to the potential loss of delegates to the Democratic convention, for not following the party\u2019s new order, which was recommended by Biden. The conflict between New Hampshire and national Democrats means Biden\u2019s name will be missing from the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot this year. New Hampshire has held its \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d primary status for more than a century. And in 1975, the state enacted a law that required the primary to take place at least seven or more days before any other state. Jan. 23 \"complies with our state statute, requiring our presidential primary to be at least seven days before any similar event, and it preserves the position of the traditional Iowa caucus,\" New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan said at a press conference Wednesday. Scanlan told NBC News ahead of his announcement that he waited to set the date until he was \u201ccomfortable that New Hampshire will hold the first in the nation presidential primary.\u201d Iowa Democrats, who were also stripped of their early slot in the DNC\u2019s approved 2024 calendar, shifted their traditional in-person caucuses to a mail-in system this year \u2014 which Scanlan had said risked triggering New Hampshire\u2019s law requiring him to move ahead of another state primary. But in early October, Iowa Democrats announced they will release their results on March 5, which is Super Tuesday. The official date clarifies the road to the GOP nomination for the candidates seeking to challenge Biden in the general election. They will compete in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15 before turning to New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 8 and South Carolina\u2019s primary on Feb. 24. For Democrats, South Carolina\u2019s primary will be on Feb. 3, followed by Nevada\u2019s on Feb. 6. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chair, said in February that changing the calendar to put South Carolina first \u201cputs Black voters at the front of the process.\u201d In July, during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cInside with Jen Psaki,\u201d Harrison said that \u201cSouth Carolina has been the best indicator\u201d of who the eventual nominee will be. The state was the first contest Biden won in the 2020 Democratic primaries. Scanlan fired back at that line of reasoning in his press conference. \"Using racial diversity as a cudgel and an attempt to rearrange the presidential nominating calendar is an ugly precedent,\" Scanlan said. \"At what point does the state become too old or too wealthy or too educated, or too religious to hold on early primary? The truth is, there is no individual state that truly reflects the makeup of America and no state is more American than any other state.\" In a letter to New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley, Biden campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez said Biden was \u201cobligated as a Democratic candidate for President to comply with the Delegate Selection Rules for the 2024 Democratic National Convention promulgated by the Democratic National Committee.\u201d  But New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, believes \u201cdelegates really don\u2019t matter\u201d in this case.   \u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s power of this process is in its ability to allow candidates to come in and be themselves,\u201d he told NBC News.  During a talk at Saint Anselm College in October, Scanlan made his case for why New Hampshire should go first.  \u201cIt\u2019s a small state geographically. It has a small media market compared to other states in the country, especially the large ones. We are a purple state politically. We have regular high voter participation. And it is very easy for any United States citizen who qualifies to run for president to actually try and make it happen,\u201d he said. This is not the first time New Hampshire has faced challenges to its status as the first primary. In 1995, then-Secretary of State Bill Gardner had to fend off a challenge from Delaware, which passed a state law putting its primary on the same date as New Hampshire\u2019s. Scanlan told NBC News he thinks the DNC and other states \u201cwill continue to pose challenges until they get tired and give up. We won\u2019t.\u201d Sununu agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our process, we\u2019ve always gotten first, and so I imagine that will continue,\u201d he said.

Senators NBC News spoke to this evening haven\u2019t been able to provide much clarity about timing but have all been confident that the CR will pass before Friday. Lori Rampani House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that ultimately House Democrats \"could live with\" the Republican CR they voted to pass yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bifurcation, but it\u2019s a bifurcation that is certainly something we could live with.

The aid issue is expected to come up after Thanksgiving. Julie Tsirkin The Senate still hasn't officially announced that it's voting on the CR soon. The vote may be delayed because, according to two sources familiar with the matter, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., has a hold on the bill.

Kyle Stewart and Garrett Haake A few hours ago, the House announced that it was canceling votes for the rest of the week and members headed out early for Thanksgiving recess.  Votes were canceled after Republicans failed to pass the rule to move forward with the Commerce, Justice and Science funding bill, one of 12 bills to fully fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year. Rule votes set the terms for debating and passing legislation and usually pass with just members of the majority party; historically they rarely fail, but there have been several instances of this happening this year. The House is now out of town until Nov. 28. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News that he\u2019s \u201cnot frustrated\u201d by the fact that he\u2019s had to pull multiple spending bills from the floor because he couldn\u2019t get GOP consensus on them. \"This is part of the process and we\u2019re working towards consensus and I\u2019ve been on the job for less than three weeks,\u201d he said. Frank Thorp V, Julie Tsirkin and Kate Santaliz All 100 senators need to agree in order to pass the CR today and overcome some procedural hurdles. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only public holdout, but agreed to move forward in exchange for getting a vote on an alternative short-term funding bill that includes spending cuts. It is not expected to pass. Then, the full Senate will vote on the CR. It's expected to pass easily and then senators will likely head home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Kyle Stewart and Scott Wong The so-called laddered continuing resolution, or CR, that passed the House yesterday would fund the government at current spending levels, but it splits that funding into two parts. The first part funds the departments dealing with agriculture, transportation, housing and urban development, military construction, energy, water and Veterans Affairs through Jan. 19. The remaining agency appropriations will be funded through Feb. 2. That includes departments dealing with commerce, justice, science, defense, financial services, homeland security, the interior, the environment, labor, education, health and human services, the legislative branch, state and foreign operations. The CR is \u201cclean,\u201d with no spending cuts or contentious policy provisions that would alienate Democrats. It also does not include a supplemental package covering things like aid for Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance or border security, leaving those issues for later in the year.

        "title": "Trump attorneys renew criticism of judge and clerk in New York fraud case by filing motion for mistrial",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers on Wednesday filed a motion for a mistrial in the $250 million New York civil fraud case, claiming that Judge Arthur Engoron and his principal law clerk demonstrated bias. The defendant's filing largely focuses on their observations of interactions between the judge and his law clerk in the case. Engoron has already issued a partial gag order prohibiting Trump from making disparaging remarks about his law clerk during the trial. Engoron issued the gag order last month after the former president trashed his law clerk on social media and to reporters. Trump\u2019s legal team has also argued that Engoron is too \u201cintertwined\u201d with his clerk, who has passed him notes and sometimes whispered to him during testimony. Engoron later expanded the gag order to include members of Trump\u2019s legal team, whom he said were \u201cfalsely accusing [his clerk] of bias against them and of improperly influencing the ongoing bench trial.\u201d Engoron said members of Trump\u2019s legal team had alleged that it\u2019s improper conduct for a judge to consult with his law clerk amid proceedings and that the passing of notes between them during the trial carries the \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d Engoron pushed back, saying in his order that arguments from Trump\u2019s lawyers \u201chave no basis.\u201d The judge later gave Trump's attorneys the green light to file an order for a motion for a mistrial, and Trump attorney Alina Habba said it would be done in a \"delicate manner.\" In the filing for a mistrial, Trump attorneys named the clerk and even included pictures of her while alleging she demonstrated \"political bias,\" pointing to what they described as political donations that exceed permitted limits.  \u201cSpecifically, the Court\u2019s own conduct, coupled with [the clerk's] unprecedented role in the trial and extensive, public partisan activities, would cause even a casual observer to question the Court\u2019s partiality,\u201d Habba and other Trump attorneys, Clifford Robert, Michael Farina and Christopher Kise, wrote in the filing. \u201cThus, only the grant of a mistrial can salvage what is left of the rule of law.\u201d The clerk's \u201cposition as a de facto co-judge violates the code\u201d and \u201ccreates the appearance, if not the fact, of a co-judge presiding over the trial,\u201d they added. Trump's lawyers went on to argue that the gag orders and enforcement also demonstrate bias. (Trump has already been fined twice for violating the gag order.) \u201cThis Court\u2019s efforts to silence counsel from objecting to and creating a record of what anyone could observe publicly taking place in the courtroom during the trial thus plainly augment the appearance of impropriety,\u201d they wrote. In response to the request from Trump lawyers for a mistrial, Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office brought the fraud case against Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization, said the former president is again \u201ctrying to dismiss the truth and the facts, but the numbers and evidence don\u2019t lie.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is now being held accountable for the years of fraud he committed and the incredible ways he lied to enrich himself and his family,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cHe can keep trying to distract from his fraud, but the truth always comes out.\u201d Trump recently smeared Engoron's law clerk in a post to his Truth Social platform by reposting a different user's Instagram post showing her at an event where she posed with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. In the post, Trump suggested, without evidence, that the clerk had an inappropriate relationship with Schumer. Trump then amplified attacks against her in brief remarks to reporters. The gag order only applies to Engoron's staff, not to the judge himself. His ruling noted that his chambers had been \"inundated\" with hundreds of threats since the beginning of the trial. Trump has continued to blast Engoron and James in recent social media posts, claiming without evidence that they are attempting to interfere with his chances of winning re-election.

        "title": "Sen. Joe Manchin says he 'absolutely' would consider a presidential run",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., inched closer Wednesday to confirming that he could run for president. \"I will do anything I can to help my country, and you're saying, 'Does that mean you would consider it?' Absolutely,\" Manchin said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker. \"Every American should consider it if they're in a position to help save the country,\" he added. Manchin said he first has to explore whether there's an appetite among voters for a moderate candidate like him. \"I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure, to mobilize that moderate, sensible, commonsense middle,\" he said. Manchin suggested that if he can \"reinvigorate\" the middle-of-the-road constituency, that would play a major role in whether he would launch a White House bid. \"I'm totally, absolutely scared to death that Donald Trump would become president again,\" he said. \"I think we will lose democracy as we know it.\" The news comes after Manchin announced last week that he would not seek re-election to the Senate, which will make it difficult for his party to hold the seat in the deep-red state and reshape the battle for Senate control in 2024. Manchin said he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a deadline for him to make a decision about a presidential run, but mentioned he would figure that out around Super Tuesday, scheduled for March 5, if he has a following.  The senator dodged questions about whether he would only run as a third-party candidate, just saying, \u201cThe bottom line is, I\u2019m as independent as it becomes.\u201d  Manchin seemed to reject the notion that an independent bid could hurt President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a spoiler in my life of anything, and I would never be a spoiler now,\u201d he said.  He said he doesn\u2019t think Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are the strongest ticket to defeat Trump, arguing that they don\u2019t cater to centrists. He said that Biden has moved \u201ctoo far left\u201d in his policies, especially on energy, and criticized the migrant situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. Although he said he is dissatisfied with the Biden administration, Manchin spoke highly about the president\u2019s stamina. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve met with Biden, we\u2019ve always had a very active engagement,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns about the effects of the president\u2019s age on his physical and mental health.  Manchin repeated that he\u2019s worried about the prospect of another Trump presidency, especially as the former president has threatened using executive power to take revenge on his opponents and prosecutors who have investigated and charged him with crimes.

        "title": "Asa Hutchinson has no plans to drop out of presidential race despite low polling",
        "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he has no plans to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, even though he said in September he should re-evaluate his campaign if he was not polling at 4% by Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is next week. Hutchinson is still scraping around 1% in GOP primary polls like the October NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of Iowa. But in an interview with NBC News, the Republican pointed to the Israel-Hamas war as enough reason to continue his campaign. And he called for the GOP to adopt more \u201ccompassionate\u201d messaging on abortion in the face of a revolt by voters against their brand on the issue.  \u201cIn the last month, just think about how the world has changed, with Hamas killing so many Israelis and invading, in an atrocious way, that country,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at war in the Middle East, there\u2019s more regional conflict. There\u2019s a greater need for me to be in this race for president now than even 30 days ago.\u201d Hutchinson blamed his low poll numbers on being outspent on TV advertising. He added that he thinks voters in Iowa and New Hampshire won\u2019t decide who to vote for in their January contests until after Thanksgiving, if then. \u201cWe\u2019re planning the campaign for Jan. 15 and leading up to that,\u201d Hutchinson said, adding that he thought he could distinguish himself \u201cbecause everybody else is just slinging mud at each other right now.\u201d When asked about pressure to drop out, following former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s decisions to end their campaigns, Hutchinson sidestepped. Despite his strong criticism of former President Donald Trump throughout the campaign, he said that there\u2019s no rush to consolidate support behind an anti-Trump candidate and that Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state, should have a choice of candidates with a breadth of experience. \u201cThe argument is that somehow, if we consolidate, that\u2019s going to make it tougher on Trump. In Iowa, Trump is down to 43% of the vote \u2014 that means 57% is looking for alternatives. They\u2019re going to have the opportunity to choose. No one thinks that this field should be consolidated before Super Tuesday,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThey ought to let the first four states vote and let\u2019s see, you know, where the strength is then. And there\u2019s certainly adequate time to make sure that we have the organized opposition to a Donald Trump presidency.\u201d In order to avoid more losses in 2024, Hutchinson said Republicans need to focus more resources on maternal health care and adoption services as well as abortion \u2014 and they need to adopt different language and policies to highlight. \u201cRepublicans need to express this in more compassionate terms, because these are problem pregnancies and that\u2019s why the woman is considering different options,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cAnd so what are we putting into maternal health care? What resources are we putting into making sure that there\u2019s adequate adoption services that are available in support for these challenges that women face?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about this,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd not just in terms of, you know, what your view is, but also in terms of compassion for these difficult circumstances that women find themselves in.\u201d Hutchinson also said Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called him to explain her endorsement of Trump, her former boss, before announcing it publicly. He said he wasn\u2019t surprised by her choice, but he also suggested there\u2019s pressure on politicians to endorse the former president \u2014 at least partially motivated by the backlash awaiting those who don\u2019t.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of congressional support and part of it is they worry about the consequences and retribution if they don\u2019t do that,\u201d Hutchinson said.

        "title": "Hunter Biden asks judge in his criminal case to subpoena Donald Trump and ex-DOJ officials",
        "content": "Hunter Biden asked the judge presiding over his criminal gun charge case to subpoena former President Donald Trump and top officials in his Justice Department, arguing that the investigation into him was the direct result of \u201cincessant, improper, and partisan pressure\u201d from Trump and his allies. The court filing Wednesday asks U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump nominee, to issue subpoenas to Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, former acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, and former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. \"Mr. Biden seeks specific information from three former DOJ officials and the former President that goes to the heart of his defense that this is, possibly, a vindictive or selective prosecution arising from an unrelenting pressure campaign beginning in the last administration, in violation of Mr. Biden\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights under the Constitution,\u201d the filing said. Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, was indicted in September on three counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. Two of the counts accuse him of having completed a form indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in Oct. 2018, and the third alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic. Two of the counts carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, while the third has a maximum of five years. Hunter Biden's lawyers have maintained the charges are unfair because prosecutors agreed to a plea deal this year that would have had a gun charge using the same facts dropped if he stayed out of trouble for a period of two years. Prosecutors had also agreed to recommend a sentence of probation in return for a guilty plea on misdemeanor tax charges. The deal was scuttled after Noreika raised questions about some of the provisions in the agreements. The filing maintains the decision to bring harsher charges was political, as was the underlying investigation itself. \"In the lead up to the 2020 election, IRS case files show certain investigative decisions were made 'as a result of guidance provided' by, among others, 'the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s office,'\u201d the filing said. It also points to a passage from Barr's recent book where he said Trump called him in October 2020 asking about the status of the probe into Joe Biden's son. Barr wrote that he responded, \u201cDammit, Mr. President, I am not going to talk to you about Hunter Biden. Period!\u201d \"These confirmations of communications give more than a mere appearance that President Trump improperly and unrelentingly pressured DOJ to pursue an investigation and prosecution of Mr. Biden to advance President Trump\u2019s partisan ambitions,\" said the filing by Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell. It also notes the pressure from House Republicans on special counsel David Weiss, who the GOP argued was taking it easy on Hunter Biden by offering him a plea deal to end the yearslong tax and gun charges probe. Lowell said that pressure \u201cculminated in Special Counsel Weiss\u2019s then changing course and bringing this Indictment on September 14 against Mr. Biden, charging three felony counts for the same gun and same facts that just a few months prior Mr. Weiss had agreed to divert under a pre-trial diversion agreement.\u201d The proposed subpoenas would call for the four to turn over all \"documents and records (personal or official platforms) reflecting communications\" during the Trump administration \"relating to or discussing any formal or informal investigation or prosecution of Hunter Biden, including, but not limited to, any decision, referral, or request to investigate or not investigate or charge or not charge Hunter Biden.\"  Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to the gun charges in October. Weiss has indicated in court filings that he plans to bring tax charges against him, as well. The special counsel's office declined to comment on the filing. Rosen, Donoghue and Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gary Grumbach produces and reports for NBC News, based in Washington, D.C.

        "title": "Left-leaning nonprofit poured $196 million of secret money into political world in 2022",
        "content": "The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a financial hub for liberal political activity in Washington and around the country, spent $196 million last year backing state ballot measures on abortion rights and helping Democrats to a better-than-expected result in the 2022 midterm elections, among other efforts. The big spending, detailed in a new tax filing obtained by NBC News, reflects the massive growth in anonymously funded, big donor-fueled political groups on the left since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. The Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is registered as a nonprofit and does not have to disclose its funders, has exploded in size since then, and it spent even more in 2022 than the $141 million it disbursed in 2018, the Trump-era midterm election. By comparison, the group spent $11 million in 2014. Yet the numbers, while large, may also show how money in politics has tightened up somewhat in the last few years after a period of rapid growth. Political nonprofits often see their spending jump significantly in election years, but Sixteen Thirty Fund's outlays in 2022 were similar to its levels in 2021. And the filing demonstrates how abortion rights moved to the center of politics \u2014 and political fundraising \u2014 in 2022, as the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and abortion became a state-by-state policy battle. Millions of dollars that the Sixteen Thirty Fund collected flowed into funding policy and political battles over abortion around the country, like successful ballot measure campaigns in Kansas and Michigan. The 2022 filing doesn't even include a more recent outlay: $12 million that the fund spent in Ohio this year, according to state campaign finance records there. That money helped finance twin ballot measure efforts, which culminated last week in passage of a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights, superseding a legislative ban. Working to protect abortion rights was a theme in a Medium post that Sixteen Thirty Fund president Amy Kurtz wrote Wednesday summarizing the group's recent activity. \"Sixteen Thirty Fund played a vital role in 2022 protecting democracy and moving the needle on policy solutions,\" Kurtz wrote, noting its support for abortion rights and candidates who advanced \"progressive values\" in 2022. The Sixteen Thirty Fund raised $191 million in revenue in 2022, the tax filing shows, the majority of which came from just six contributors who gave huge amounts: $34.8 million, $19 million, $14.9 million, $12 million, $11.9 million and $8.5 million. By comparison, only a few dozen donors disclosed spending those amounts on politics in 2022, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that tracks money in politics. Overall, more than $170 million of Sixteen Thirty's funds came from 32 donors who gave at least $1 million apiece in 2022. While the Sixteen Thirty Fund does not name its donors, filings in past years have detailed some of its biggest supporters prior to 2022. It has received tens of millions in past years from groups including the Open Society Policy Center, part of the nonprofit network funded by Democratic megadonor George Soros. Berger Action Fund, the nonprofit founded by the Swiss-born billionaire Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, has also given significant sums to Sixteen Thirty Fund in the past. (Berger Action Fund has previously said it does not allow its funds to be used on partisan political activity.) In her Medium post, Kurtz wrote that the Sixteen Thirty Fund supports legal changes that would require donor disclosure and impose other, tighter regulations on political nonprofits. But in the meantime, she wrote, \"we follow the rules and respect the choices of individual donors to remain anonymous if they want to be.\" Most of the money Sixteen Thirty Fund raised in 2022 flowed back out via grants to other political and nonprofit groups on the left, including millions to groups focused on voter turnout, statewide ballot measures and specific campaigns from the state legislative level up to the U.S. Senate. Less than half of Sixteen Thirty Fund's spending, $66 million, was labeled as expressly political activity, but much of the rest still related to the midterm elections in some way. Twenty-eight different groups received grants of at least $1 million from the nonprofit hub. That includes America Votes, a leading voter-turnout group on the left, which got nearly $20.7 million in funding from Sixteen Thirty Fund. A pair of Michigan ballot measure efforts also got big grants: $10.4 million backing changes to state election rules, and $5.8 million to the effort that put abortion rights in the state constitution. Other notable grants included $1.5 million to the Kansas ballot measure effort that protected abortion rights there, and $4.2 million to Open Democracy PAC, which backed \"pro-democracy\" candidates for a slew of state and local offices in 2022.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Housing and Urban Development is highlighting homeownership figures for first-time homebuyers in an annual report from the Federal Housing Administration released Wednesday. The FHA helped more than 478,000 first-time homebuyers obtain mortgage insurance during fiscal year 2023, according to the report submitted to Congress. \u201cThe President and I share the belief that enabling wealth-opportunities \u2014 like homeownership for underserved borrowers \u2014 helps us all,\u201d HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. \u201cIn 2023, HUD delivered on this mission, building a fairer, more inclusive, and stronger country by bringing nearly half a million new homebuyers into the fold.\u201d Overall, the FHA helped 765,000 homeowners, including more than 33,000 seniors, get access to mortgage credit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. FHA mortgages are designed for low- and middle-income homebuyers and require lower down payments that allow for more flexibility on credit requirements than conventional mortgage loans. The Biden administration on Oct. 16 announced new efforts to support homeownership, including awarding loans to tribal communities and supporting veterans behind on their mortgage loans, as well as releasing data to show how the funds from the American Rescue Plan are supporting homeowners at risk of foreclosure. Still, the number of mortgages the FHA helped facilitate for both first-time homeowners and repeat buyers was the fewest since 2007. A spokesperson for HUD, which oversees the FHA, said the figure was attributable to the housing market volume\u2019s shrinking. The report also pointed to a slew of challenges HUD faced over the past fiscal year, including the rising cost of homes and low housing supply. \u201cDespite numerous challenges in the mortgage and housing markets, FHA continued to facilitate the availability of financing for first-time homebuyers, borrowers of color, and others traditionally underserved by the conventional mortgage market,\u201d the 135-page report said. The report also noted that the average age of first-time homebuyers held steady at 38. The average age has hovered around 37 and 38 since 2015. Megan Lebowitz is based in the Washington bureau.

        "title": "Why Vivek Ramaswamy is itching for a fight with his own party",
        "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s fight for the Republican presidential nomination is increasingly turning into a battle with the Republican Party itself. Ramaswamy\u2019s latest salvo, after he attacked Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel in his opening statement at last week\u2019s GOP debate, includes the launch of a new website: FireRonna.com. He blames McDaniel for the party\u2019s bad election results since she took over the RNC in 2017, though that\u2019s also when Donald Trump became president. He chafed at the party\u2019s debate rules earlier in the campaign. But it\u2019s more than that: It\u2019s all part of Ramaswamy\u2019s campaign persona as an outsider parachuting in to address a broken system and his attempt to draft off the same anti-insider sentiment that lifted Trump from outsider to leader of the party and the country. Ramaswamy is sticking to that theme even when he doesn\u2019t have the truth on his side. When he continued to call for McDaniel\u2019s resignation on social media after the debate, he claimed the RNC is \u201cgoing to cut me off of funding\u201d in retaliation. The RNC doesn\u2019t fund candidates in primaries, as a spokesperson for the RNC and McDaniel noted. Ramaswamy has mostly self-funded his campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a party of losers at the end of the day,\u201d Ramaswamy said within minutes of the start of last week\u2019s debate. \u201cIt is a cancer to the Republican establishment,\u201d he said, citing the losses the right suffered in states like Ohio and Virginia last week.  Ramaswamy continued by calling for McDaniel\u2019s resignation. \u201cRonna, if you want to come onstage tonight, you want to look the GOP voters in the eye and tell them you resign, I will turn over my \u2014 yield my time to you,\u201d he said. It might have been a new message for the national TV audience, but they aren\u2019t new talking points for Ramaswamy. In recent weeks, he has been targeting attacks on his own party to small rooms of Republicans in early-voting states such as New Hampshire and Iowa. At a campaign stop in Hampton, New Hampshire, last month, Ramaswamy criticized the RNC for prohibiting him and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie from participating in a live broadcast together on Fox News. To qualify for the RNC debates, Ramaswamy had to sign a pledge not to participate in unsanctioned debates. But he described it to his event audience with more sinister undertones: \u201cThey\u2019re trying every means of stopping me from speaking. They said, well, Chris Christie, Fox challenges me to a debate. The RNC says no, we can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t take the risk of letting them hear from you.\u201d Ultimately, the RNC sent letters warning Christie\u2019s and Ramaswamy\u2019s campaigns of the possibility of being disqualified from further debates if they went ahead with a TV segment together. They appeared in separate blocks of the show. Hitting out at the RNC also provides a ready-made conspiracy theory if Ramaswamy fails to make a future debate, though he appears to have met the qualification criteria for the next one already, according to an NBC News polling analysis. On a podcast episode with conservative media personality Benny Johnson last week, Ramaswamy was asked whether he felt he\u2019d be allowed at the fourth GOP debate given his onstage remarks. \u201cI mean, better be,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get a very warm invitation, but they have set some rules. I\u2019ve already qualified for the fourth debate in early December. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to try every trick in the book to silence me or keep me out.\u201d When NBC News asked Ramaswamy whether he wanted to continue participating in debates if the RNC is the organizer, he snapped back, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong to her,\u201d referring to McDaniel, adding, \u201cShe acts like the party belongs to her.\u201d And he described himself in terms stretching beyond the party. \u201cI think that the Republican Party is a party in search of an identity, and I will lead us to revive that identity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think our nation right now is a nation in search of an identity, and I\u2019m running to lead a nation, and I\u2019m using the Republican Party as a vehicle to do it to advance a pro-American agenda.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time a presidential candidate has gone to war with his or her own party in a primary campaign \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s not even the first time this year. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. started his 2024 campaign as a Democrat before he recently launched an independent run for the White House. That came after he criticized President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee for not setting up debates, though he struggled in polls of the Democratic primary campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and supporters have charged that the 2016 Democratic nominating contest, which Hillary Clinton won by a comfortable margin, was rigged against him. And Trump delighted in criticizing the RNC and Republican elites when he was still an upstart primary candidate \u2014 before he took over the party and installed McDaniel as chair in 2017. McDaniel brushed off Ramaswamy\u2019s attacks immediately after last week\u2019s debate. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to get headlines, right? I\u2019m going to focus on beating Joe Biden,\u201d McDaniel told reporters, also quipping, \u201cHe just lost my son\u2019s vote.\u201d The RNC re-elected McDaniel to a fourth term in January.

        "title": "Biden compares Trump's 'vermin' remarks to Nazi rhetoric",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday decried former President Donald Trump\u2019s recent remarks calling his political foes \u201cvermin\u201d as rhetoric reminiscent of Nazi Germany. During a rally in New Hampshire last weekend, Trump vowed to \u201croot out\u201d groups he characterized as \u201cvermin\u201d who act as \u201cthreats from within\u201d the U.S. \u201cWe pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country,\u201d Trump said while pushing baseless claims of widespread election fraud led by his opponents. Trump's \"vermin\" comments are the latest in a series of recent remarks lashing out at political and legal opponents in increasingly violent terms. Biden excoriated Trump\u2019s remarks as language echoing Nazi Germany in the 1930s during a campaign fundraiser in San Francisco on Tuesday night. Nazi propaganda referred to Jewish people as \u201cvermin\u201d who need to be extinguished for plaguing lands, comparing them to rats that spread diseases. \u201cIn just the last few days, Trump has said, if he returns office, he\u2019s gonna go after all those who oppose him and wipe out what he called the vermin, quote, the vermin in America \u2014 a specific phrase with a specific meaning,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt echoes language you heard in Nazi Germany in the '30s. And it isn\u2019t even the first time,\u201d he added. \u201cTrump also recently talked about, quote, the blood of America is being poisoned. The blood of America is being poisoned. Again, it echoes the same phrases used in Nazi Germany.\u201d Reached for comment Wednesday morning in response to Biden\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s remarks, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that \u201cit\u2019s despicable and racist\u201d for Biden \u201cto make that disgusting connection.\u201d \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t expect him to conduct himself in an honorable manner. He\u2019s clearly suffering from a severe case of Trump derangement syndrome and should get professional help,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere has been no bigger ally to Israel and the Jewish people than\u201d Trump. Cheung continued: \u201cHe renewed America\u2019s cherished friendship and alliance with Israel and took historic action to promote peace in the Middle East. Whereas Biden\u2019s weak and disastrous leadership has made America and the rest of the world less safe.\u201d Biden's campaign and White House officials also blasted Trump\u2019s remarks this week. \u201cOn a weekend when most Americans were honoring our nation\u2019s heroes, Donald Trump parroted the autocratic language of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini \u2014 two dictators many U.S. veterans gave their lives fighting, in order to defeat exactly the kind of un-American ideas Trump now champions,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement Monday, referring to the commemoration of Veterans Day last weekend. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Monday in a statement, quoting a Washington Post headline, \u201cEmploying words like \u2018vermin\u2019 to describe anyone who makes use of their basic right to criticize the government \u2018echoes dictators\u2019 like Hitler and Mussolini. Using terms like that about dissent would be unrecognizable to our founders, but horrifyingly recognizable to American veterans who put on their country\u2019s uniform in the 1940s. \u201d Prior to Biden\u2019s remarks Tuesday night, Cheung had pushed back on comparisons of Trump\u2019s comments to Nazis and past authoritarian leaders such as Hitler. \u201cThose who try to make that ridiculous assertion are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump derangement syndrome and their sad, miserable existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House,\u201d Cheung said Monday in a statement. Trump\u2019s public statements in recent weeks have taken a dark and aggressive turn, including attacks on law enforcement officials involved in various legal cases against him. In a Monday post to his Truth Social platform, Trump warned special counsel Jack Smith, former Justice Department official Andrew Weissmann and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco will end up in a mental institution if he is re-elected as president next year. They will end up, Trump said, \u201csuffering from a horrible disease, TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME (TDS!), in a Mental Institution by the time my next term as President is successfully completed. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d  Smith is serving as special counsel in two Trump federal investigations: the former president\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his mishandling of classified documents after he departed the White House. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in both cases. Trump on Tuesday also reposted a now-deleted statement on Truth Social from a user who wrote that they hope for a \u201ccitizens arrest\u201d of New York Attorney General Letitia James and Judge Arthur Engoron amid the $250 million civil fraud trial that jeopardizes the Trump family\u2019s real estate empire. Trump has repeatedly accused James and Engoron of election interference by attempting to hurt his chances of re-election with the trial, which he has decried as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "President Joe Biden will announce his intention Wednesday to nominate an attorney whose Senate confirmation would make him the first Muslim American judge to serve on a federal appeals court, a White House official said. The nominee, Adeel A. Mangi, has served on the board of directors of the Muslim Bar Association of New York, the Legal Aid Society of New York and Muslims for Progressive Values and as an ally board member for the National LGBT Bar Association, according to his biographical page at the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, where he\u2019s a partner. If he\u2019s confirmed, he would sit on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia. The court covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands. As an attorney, Mangi has worked with clients on commercial contracts, false advertising and consumer protection statutes in state and federal courts, having secured a $2 billion verdict last year in a case involving theft of trade secrets in the software industry. The White House on Wednesday highlighted Mangi's handling of court filings before state and federal appeals courts, including one that appeared before the Supreme Court on behalf of a multifaith religious coalition. Biden has faced increasing pressure to address Islamophobia as both Muslims and Jewish people face growing threats in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Some Muslim voters have expressed frustration with Biden\u2019s declaration last month of unwavering support for Israel without seeking a cease-fire. Mangi has been involved in legal disputes involving accusations of discrimination against Muslims. In 2016, he filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a local Islamic group that alleged anti-Muslim sentiment over a planning board\u2019s denial of a proposal to build a mosque in New Jersey. He is one of five nominees whom Biden will announce Wednesday, the White House official said. Another nominee, St. Joseph County, Indiana, Superior Court Judge Cristal Brisco, would be the first Black woman and the first woman of color to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana if she is confirmed. The Democratic-led Senate this month confirmed Biden's 150th federal judge. By the end of his presidency, Donald Trump had appointed more than 200 judges, while President Barack Obama appointed 324 over eight years. White House counsel Ed Siskel said in a statement Wednesday that the new nominations expand on Biden\u2019s efforts \u201cto bring professional and demographic diversity to the federal judiciary.\u201d Zo\u00eb Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "J.B. Pritzker, a key Biden surrogate, builds up nonprofit group as 2024 looms",
        "content": "CHICAGO \u2014 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, widely considered a contender for a future White House run, is bulking up hiring at a nonprofit committee he launched that combats abortion restrictions and political extremism.  Pritzker\u2019s Think Big America has hired Christina Amestoy as its communications director after she previously worked at the Democratic Governors Association for four years. At the DGA, she was a top communications strategist in competitive governor's races, including campaigns in Arizona, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nevada and Illinois. Bringing in Amestoy is a signal Pritzker is looking to push a more national narrative with his group come 2024. He has stepped up his advocacy for the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden's re-election, particularly in recent months. That has included holding a fundraiser for the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Chicago next year. Last month, Pritzker headlined an event for Wisconsin Democrats and argued that Biden, much maligned because of his age, should instead be praised because it was an asset. Last week, Pritzker traveled to Florida, where he took part in counterprogramming during the Republican presidential primary debate in Miami. After that, Pritzker joined Biden during his visit to an auto plant in Belvidere, Illinois. \"My buddy,\" Biden said of Pritzker at a fundraising reception after the auto plant visit. \"The governor is as responsible for my being behind this podium as anybody. He\u2019s helped me so much. I didn\u2019t even realize how much he helped until about a year after I got elected. But thank you, Gov. Appreciate it.\" Pritzker has long defended abortion rights and held up Illinois as a beacon of reproductive freedom in the Midwest, welcoming women from red states. Amestoy joins Think Big America as it ramps up its 2024 efforts. The group is a 501(c)4 nonprofit organization, which does not have to disclose its donors. But as of now, Pritzker is the only donor, according to the group. Pritzker, a billionaire, has sunk his personal money into the group to fund efforts in competitive races. That includes the group's donating $250,000 to Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights in the state\u2019s ballot measure vote last week, when voters chose to add protections for reproductive health decisions to the state constitution. Members of Think Big worked as strategists in the Ohio effort, and Pritzker gave $750,000 personally to the effort to defend abortion. In the Virginia elections, Think Big also gave $250,000 to a combination of the state Democratic Party and support in four state Senate districts that could have been decisive, the group said.  The group has also invested $1 million in Nevada, which is pursuing a 2024 ballot initiative to protect abortion in the state. And according to Amestoy, the group is in conversations to possibly assist the on-the-ground effort in Arizona. Asked whether the Think Big effort telegraphed Pritzker\u2019s future prospects as a presidential contender, Amestoy said: \u201cThe governor is extremely happy being governor right now. \u2026 He\u2019s looking at what\u2019s at stake. He sees himself as having a role.\u201d   In a launch video last month, Pritzker described Think Big America as a vehicle to battle extremism, with a particular initial focus on supporting abortion rights. In addition to laws overturning reproductive rights, he referred to book bans, a rollback of voting rights and erosion of trust in government institutions as the results of a more extreme Republican Party.   \u201cThat will be our permanent reality if we don\u2019t act now,\u201d he said.  Mike Ollen, a senior adviser for Think Big America, wrote in an email: \u201cWe were honored to work alongside champions for reproductive rights in Ohio to reverse the state\u2019s abortion ban and to support leaders in Virginia who prevented right-wing extremists from eliminating the South\u2019s last oasis for abortion access. We will continue to defeat extreme policies across the country because, at Think Big America, we trust women. Period.\u201d Natasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy joins primary race against indicted Sen. Menendez",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy announced Wednesday morning that she would launch a primary campaign to challenge indicted Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez in the 2024 election.  In a launch video her campaign posted online, Murphy leans into programs she has championed as first lady, focusing on reducing maternal and infant mortality and changing the state\u2019s education requirements to include climate change.  \u201cWe need a Senator who will work every single day to lower the cost of living, protect abortion rights, end the gun violence epidemic, and defend our democracy,\u201d Murphy said in a statement accompanying the video.  The video makes no direct mention of Menendez, who was indicted on federal bribery charges in September. He does appear for a few seconds of voiceover video as Murphy narrates: \u201cRight now, Washington is filled with too many people who are more interested in getting rich or getting on camera than in getting things done for you.\u201d Murphy has never held elected office, and she may face criticism about her lack of a traditional political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and her history as a Republican until the mid-2010s. If she is elected, she would be the first woman to represent New Jersey in the Senate. Murphy joins Rep. Andy Kim, a three-term House member and former Obama national security aide, in what may yet become a still more crowded June Democratic primary in the deep blue state.  Menedez has said repeatedly that he intends to fight the charges against him and to seek re-election, despite the calls for his resignation from more than 30 Democratic Senate colleagues, as well as Murphy\u2019s husband, Gov. Phil Murphy, and other party leaders. The Murphys are multimillionaires; Phil Murphy is a former executive at Goldman Sachs. His office released a summary of their tax returns that disclosed that in 2021, while he was in office, they reported nearly $5 million in income. He spent $20 million of his own money on his 2017 bid for governor. Garrett Haake is an NBC News Capitol Hill Correspondent. ",

        "title": "Chuck Todd: When words lose meaning in politics",
        "content": "One of the hallmark answers of the confident Democratic strategist about 2024 usually includes some combination of the following: Joe Biden will win thanks to abortion, concerns over democracy and worries about GOP extremism. Ask Republican strategists what gives them confidence about winning in 2024, and I usually get answers that include the phrase \u201cradical left\u201d or the word \u201csocialism\u201d \u2014 and the belief that they will turn off enough swing voters to help Donald Trump. But here\u2019s the thing: One person\u2019s \u201cextremist\u201d is another person\u2019s \u201cpassionate advocate,\u201d and one person\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d is simply another person\u2019s brother in arms. All of this stems from surprising poll results from a Democratic outside group called Blueprint, which bills itself as \u201ca new public opinion research initiative designed to study the most crucial voting groups and which policies and messages are breaking through and resonating with them.\u201d The short version: It\u2019s a Democratic polling initiative trying to nudge Biden\u2019s campaign and Democrats as a whole to come up with better messaging to swing voters. There are a few key takeaways from Blueprint\u2019s initial survey of voter perceptions of Biden, Trump and their accomplishments and promises. The biggest one Blueprint wants the White House to know is that \u201cBidenomics,\u201d as it\u2019s currently viewed, isn\u2019t a net positive for the president. Its polling shows voters are judging the economy on the price of goods, not whether they have good jobs. Biden and his White House advisers have never faced an economic climate in which jobs were plentiful but prices were high. They\u2019ve spent the better part of 30 years believing the best economic message is a jobs message. But that has changed, thanks to the unique circumstances of our pandemic-recovering economy, and Democrats are struggling to accept the premise that a low unemployment rate isn\u2019t being viewed as the No. 1 way to judge the country\u2019s economic conditions. In addition, the group noted, voters had heard more about Biden\u2019s more \u201cprogressive\u201d accomplishments (or attempted progressive actions, like canceling federal student loan debt) than his more moderate ones, like opening up more oil and gas permitting. In case you\u2019re wondering, swing voters like the energy initiatives more than student debt relief. I believe this finding is a function of two things: Both liberal media and conservative pro-Trump media want to tout the progressive items. Neither liberal media nor conservative media wants to trumpet the idea, either, that the other side has mainstream accomplishments \u2014 or, in the case of the former, accept the premise that there are centrist ideas more popular than progressive ones. But it was Blueprint\u2019s final big takeaway that really catches the eye: Voters believe Biden and the Democratic Party to be as extreme as Trump and the GOP. It\u2019s a finding that will send those who live in a blue bubble into disbelief, while folks who live in a red bubble are wondering why voters don\u2019t think the Democrats are more extreme. But in purple America, this is a reminder that the principles of physics apply to political polarization. For every harsh, over-the-top rhetorical attack, there\u2019s an equally harsh rhetorical retort that will seem just as believable to the less partisan eye. And that appears to be the vocabulary standoff the two sides find themselves in right now. Each side is desperate to brand the other as extremely out of touch with the mainstream. And both parties have succeeded. Just 28% of those surveyed by Blueprint say Biden\u2019s ideology is \u201cclose\u201d to their views, while 43% consider Biden \u201cfar more liberal than me.\u201d For Trump, the numbers are 32% of voters who say he\u2019s \u201cclose\u201d to their views, versus 41% who describe him as \u201cfar more conservative than me.\u201d Neither side may accept this reality from voters, and I\u2019m sure I will get some passionate emails explaining to me why side A is truly an extremist and side B is simply responding to this current moment of crisis. But it doesn\u2019t change the perception going into 2024. The political world has diluted the meanings of words and phrases so effectively (and, in some cases, done a full gaslight on phrases like \u201cfake news\u201d) that it has blunted the impact of some words compared to even 10 years ago. Both \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d could have an impact in both parties back in 2012 (without getting overly used). But not anymore. Part of that phenomenon comes from the ridiculous rhetoric that is commonplace in fundraising emails. Obviously, the assumption is that only the most passionate supporters of the Red Team or the Blue Team are meant to be activated by fundraising email rhetoric. But the absurd rhetoric borders on insulting one\u2019s intelligence. The idea that they are tracking donations and noticed yours was missing is ridiculous. So is the idea that a small donation now will have an impact the campaign will notice. It\u2019s the worst type of cable TV hype marketing, and it has become a mainstay of political fundraising rhetoric. But it isn\u2019t just fundraising rhetoric that has rendered some words less meaningful \u2014 there\u2019s also social media. You don\u2019t need me to find explicit examples of over-the-top rhetoric from the accounts of so-called mainstream politicians. Simply open X and search political accounts. This is an important insight as strategists decide how to prosecute this campaign in 2024. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats could build a larger anti-Trump coalition effectively using extremism as an organizing tool. But a few things appear to have happened in the last two years. For one thing, Trump has been co-opting extremism rhetoric with his voters, doing his best to project it back on the left. In some ways, the right\u2019s \u201cown the libs\u201d mindset allows it to feel like a badge of honor when the left or someone in the dispassionate middle refers to it as extremist. Many Trumpers embrace the word \u201cradical\u201d as a way of defanging the term. There has also been the deplatforming of Trump on mainstream social media sites for much of the last three years. It shielded people who don\u2019t follow politics day to day from Trump\u2019s increasingly disturbing rhetoric. If a rhetorical bomb, like threatening to lock up government workers, falls in a Truth Social forest but no one in the mainstream is there to hear about it, did it make an impact? Nothing about this means Trump isn\u2019t out of the mainstream on a lot of issues compared to where Republicans have been for decades, but this poll is a reminder that the public doesn\u2019t necessarily see the words \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cmainstream\u201d as describing the same ideas the same ways. The point the Blueprint pollsters are making is that wooing swing voters is about meeting them where they are, not telling them what they should think. Really running against Trump means running against his ideas and proposals specifically, versus trying to label it all as \u201cextreme.\u201d Many voters want the bull-in-the-china-shop approach to politics right now. But the more general \u2014 and less specific \u2014 one sounds in trying to paint the other side as \u201cextreme,\u201d the more the swing voter is going to dismiss that rhetoric. I do think the eventual winner of this election\u2019s swing voters will be the candidate and party that convinces these voters they will heal the country, not divide us more. The harsher one sounds about the current state of our politics, the more it could turn off the very voters needed to win in this polarized climate. About that fundraising-style rhetoric: It has now crept into TV ads. Check out this opener from GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. It\u2019s filled with over-the-top rhetoric that isn\u2019t believable to anyone of rational thought but sounds good to those on the passionate right.  \u201cCrime is rampant and goes unpunished. Our border is wide open,\u201d Scott begins in the ad, reeling off a litany of other complaints about the state of the nation, from foreign policy to the national debt and beyond. If you want to bring the country together, claiming crime goes unpunished (it doesn\u2019t) or that the border is wide open (it isn\u2019t) doesn\u2019t exactly win over hearts and minds. Of course, nothing about this spot is about bringing the country together. This is the language that has become more mainstream, and ironically, no one using it would talk like this in a board room or at a PTA meeting or in their own home. I\u2019m not fully convinced this tone of TV ad is a good one for a Senate race, but if you are seeking to become a leader of the Trump-led conservative movement, then this rhetoric may make sense. Perhaps this is his way of running to be the next Senate majority leader. This was a striking climate change spot from Democratic Maryland Senate candidate David Trone: Changing the words of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d might have been considered risky in another time, but not today. Trone is running in a tough primary to succeed retiring Sen. Ben Cardin. His chief primary opponent is Angela Alsobrooks, the popular Prince George\u2019s County executive. This is going to be a very divisive and expensive primary between a self-funder in Trone and a candidate in Alsobrooks who is winning more early endorsements so far. This means Trone needs to stick out as early and as often as he can. Creating sticky TV ads like this one is a way to make some inroads. As you can probably tell, I love perusing political TV ads. There\u2019s so much that can be gleaned from a TV ad, from which voters candidates want to target to what issues they think will resonate. With Republicans struggling to message to both their base anti-abortion activist voters and swing voters, I found this one to be among the most compelling. It\u2019s from Eric Doden, a former president of the Indiana Economic Forum. He\u2019s an underdog in a crowded primary for Indiana governor that also features conservative Republican Sen. Mike Braun. Standing out as a conservative in a GOP primary in Indiana isn\u2019t easy. But check out this ad, which hints at the abortion issue without actually saying the word.  \"Thirteen thousand. That\u2019s the number of children in foster care in Indiana. They\u2019re among our most vulnerable citizens, and they deserve to be in permanent loving homes,\u201d Doden\u2019s wife says in the ad. \u201cMy husband, Eric Doden, is determined to help them and support the families who step up to provide those homes. Eric\u2019s zero-cost adoption policy would be the first in the nation.\u201d I\u2019ve heard plenty of Republicans recently admit they need to act out their longtime \u201cpro-life\u201d slogan beyond abortion, not just worry about a life before a person is born. This is one of the few recent examples I\u2019ve seen in which a candidate is trying to put his money where that rhetoric takes him. Let\u2019s see if voters respond.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform disclosed an accumulated loss of tens of millions of dollars, according to a filing released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The securities filing was made by special acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp, which has planned to merge with the owner of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology (TMTG). Truth Social turned a profit of $50.5 million for the full year in 2022, the filing shows, followed by a nearly $23 million net loss in the first six months of this year. The company recorded an accumulated loss of $31.6 million as of June 30, contributing to \u201csubstantial doubt that TMTG will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due, including liabilities related to promissory notes previously issued by TMTG,\u201d the filing says. The filing adds, \"TMTG believes that it may be difficult to raise additional funds through traditional financing sources in the absence of material progress toward completing its merger with Digital World.\" TMTG started its operations in February 2021 and launched the social media platform in the first quarter of 2022. When reached for comment on the filing, a spokesperson for TMTG pointed to a Truth Social post from the company that said in part \"the Fake News\" was \"ignoring that yesterday\u2019s filing was a crucial milestone toward completing our proposed merger.\" NBC News reached out to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign for comment on the filing. Trump created Truth Social after he was banned from Twitter, now known as X, in the days following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The former president often posts on his Truth Social account, repeating the same bombastic language that he used on Twitter when he was president. In recent days, he's been using the platform to attack prosecutors who have charged him with federal crimes. Trump marketed his social media site as a place for free speech and as an alternative that stands up to big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook. CORRECTION (Nov. 14, 2023, 9:08 p.m. ET): The headline on a previous version of this article misstated the financial loss disclosed by Truth Social. It was $31.6 million, not $73 million. A previous version of the article also misstated the company\u2019s earnings in 2022. The company had a profit of $50.5 million, not a net loss of over $50 million.

We\u2019re ready to do that.\u201d Kyle Stewart More Republicans \u2014 93 \u2014 voted against this CR than opposed the last clean funding bill in September. As with the last bill, more Democrats voted for the CR than did Republicans. Only two Democrats voted against the measure today: Reps. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Mike Quigley of Illinois; Quigley was the lone Dem to vote against the September CR. For context, the CR that the House approved Sept. 30 passed on a vote of 335-91. Scott Wong and Kyle Stewart House lawmakers on Tuesday passed Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown, likely punting the GOP\u2019s spending fight until after the holidays. The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to send it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by Friday night to avert a shutdown. Kyle Stewart Typically, the House will vote on a \"rule,\" a procedural vote that paves the way for bills to be passed with a simple majority. Rules are usually passed by the majority party, but Republican leaders are using a different tactic due to conservative opposition. Instead, they are bringing the CR to the floor \u201cunder suspension of the rules.\u201d This means it will need the support of two-thirds of the chamber to pass. This change was made because it was clear that there would not be enough Republican votes to pass the rule, but Democrats seem willing to vote to pass the bill itself. Sarah Mimms The House is now voting on the CR. Two-thirds of the House will need to vote yea to pass it. Sarah Mimms The House was expected to vote on the CR between 4:30-5:30 p.m. ET, but they're handling a series of unrelated amendment votes that are taking a while. Each of these votes is supposed to be a \"two-minute vote,\" but they often go over time. The vote on the actual CR is the last in this vote series and should happen within the hour. Frank Thorp V Senate Republicans are trying to use the fact that there is no pending business before the Senate \u2014 because they\u2019re waiting for the House to pass this CR so they can start considering it \u2014 to try to force consideration of the House-passed Israel aid bill. Democrats support aid for Israel but oppose the House's bill because it cuts funding to ramp up IRS enforcement. As a result, it would add billions to the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Kyle Stewart The House will vote on Johnson\u2019s two-step continuing resolution in the next vote series, scheduled to start around 4:30 p.m. It will be the 11th vote of the series, so it will likely come up closer to 5:30 p.m. Scott Wong House Dem leadership endorsed Johnson's two-step CR in a statement before the vote, saying it\u2019s \u201cdevoid of harmful cuts and free of extreme right-wing policy riders.\" \"We will support it,\" leadership said. \"Moving forward, it is important that Congress comes together to advance the supplemental national security and domestic policy funding requested by President Joe Biden,\" they continued. Marley Jay If the federal government shuts down Saturday, numerous publicly funded agencies will stop work and their employees won\u2019t be paid, but Social Security checks will still go out. Social Security is considered a mandatory program, and it isn\u2019t funded by the shorter-term appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. That means its operations and funding don\u2019t stop when the government shuts down. That\u2019s important for a large proportion of Americans, as about 67 million people receive monthly Social Security benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. Those benefits go primarily to retirees but also to people with disabilities, as well as dependents of deceased beneficiaries.  Medicare and Veterans Affairs benefits also continue to be distributed during a shutdown. Read the full story here.

The federal government will shut down and be unable to continue paying its workers starting Saturday unless Congress passes a new funding bill. While airport security and air traffic controllers will still be required to show up for work without pay, past shutdowns have led to increases in absenteeism, which could be a recipe for flight delays and extreme security lines for holiday travelers.

McCarthy said that he just bumped into one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust him by accident. \u201cIf I kidney punched him, he\u2019d be on the ground,\" McCarthy said. Meanwhile, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has filed an ethics complaint against McCarthy over the incident. Gaetz was not there. Kate Santaliz and Annemarie Bonner Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he supports Johnson's plan for a CR. \"I intend to support it. I understand it\u2019s likely to clear the House on a bipartisan basis. It\u2019s nice to see us working together to prevent a government shutdown,\" he said during a news conference. \"And we\u2019ll deal with all of the other big issues that we have ahead of us during this period between now and the time the CR expires. So, I\u2019m happy for him and look forward to seeing it pass on a bipartisan basis.\" Sarah Mimms Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., accused former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of elbowing him in the kidneys this morning. McCarthy later denied this \"cheap shot,\" Burchett said. Then, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., tried to start a physical fight with a committee witness, the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O\u2019Brien. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had to break it up, yelling at both men and banging his gavel. \u201cStop it! No, no, sit down! You know, you\u2019re a United States senator,\" he said to Mullin. And Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., got into a testy exchange with Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., telling Moskowitz, who's dressed in a blue suit and tie today, \"You look like a Smurf,\" referring to the popular and very blue cartoon characters. The tensions on Capitol Hill are hitting their peak after a long period in session. The House has been working for 10 weeks straight, an unusually long time without a break, and several of them were spent on an ugly fight over the speaker's gavel. The Senate has been working about half as long. As Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's press secretary put it on X: \"Today is another example of why Congress shouldn\u2019t be in session for 5 weeks straight. Weird things happen. weird things = physical altercations.\" Luckily, if this CR passes and the Senate is able to take it up quickly, they could start a Thanksgiving break as soon as tomorrow. Kyle Stewart Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., said he'll support the CR today and wondered aloud about criticism of the bill focused on the fact that Democrats plan to support it. \"When did bipartisanship become bad?\" he said. When a reporter responded that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted because he worked with Democrats on the last funding bill, Van Orden cut in. \"Speaker McCarthy was ousted because there\u2019s an immature man child that happened to be elected to Congress from Florida. That\u2019s why he was ousted. Let\u2019s just be frank,\" he said. Kyle Stewart and Rebecca Kaplan Several conservative House Republicans who oppose the CR criticized the bill for not having any spending cuts, but most of them avoided putting the blame on Johnson himself.  \"Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve said about Speaker Johnson. He did not set the table. He did not cause the situation that has come to pass,\" Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said. \"We\u2019re going to have to get through it. But we need something better than this.\" \"I don\u2019t support the clean CR for the same reasons that I didn\u2019t support the last clean CR,\" Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said. \"And so I don\u2019t like the bill. I like Speaker Johnson.\" \"Speaker Johnson has been on the job for what, two or three weeks now?\" Good continued. \"It\u2019s like throwing in a quarterback in the fourth quarter and expecting to make up for three quarters of failure and you\u2019re behind 35, nothing. ... The reason why Speaker Johnson finds himself in the position he is in is because of nine months of failure under Speaker McCarthy.\" Frank Thorp V Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke on the Senate floor this morning, reiterating that he is pleased that the House stopgap government funding bill does not include poison pill cuts. \u201cThe proposal before the House does two things Democrats have pushed for: It will avert a shutdown and it will do so without making any terrible hard right cuts that the MAGA right-wing demand,\u201d Schumer said. \"I hope the speaker does not yield to the demands of the hard right as we try to keep the government open,\" Schumer continued. \"Instead, I hope the speaker continues to recognize he will need Democratic votes in order to avoid a shutdown.\" Kyle Stewart and Rebecca Kaplan Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy, had an odd run-in with the former speaker in the halls this morning. Burchett had stopped to answer a question from reporters when McCarthy walked by with his detail and appeared to bump into Burchett\u2019s back. At first, Burchett apologized, thinking he had been in someone\u2019s way. When he realized it was McCarthy he started yelling \u201cKevin! Hey Kevin!\u201d and asked why McCarthy elbowed him. McCarthy just kept walking and never turned around, though Burchett was very loudly calling his name. Burchett then turned to reporters and called McCarthy a \u201cjerk.\u201d Asked later what happened, Burchett said that McCarthy had \"elbowed me in the kidneys,\" saying he believed it was done \"100% on purpose.\" Burchett said he confronted McCarthy, who denied what Burchett called a \"cheap shot.\" \"He\u2019s just a bully with $17 million and a security detail,\" Burchett said. \"In Tennessee, we handle it face to face, not somebody that comes and hits you in the back,\" Burchett said. \"I don\u2019t know what they teach them in Southern California.\" \"It shocked me more than anything else. It really did. It was the last thing I expected,\" he added. There\u2019s no love lost between McCarthy and the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. Particularly on a day when they\u2019re expected to allow the new speaker to pass his own clean CR without similar repercussions for his job. Scott Wong and Rebecca Kaplan Responding to conservative criticism of his two-step CR, Johnson called himself \"one of the arch-conservatives.\u201d \u201cWe are not surrendering. We are fighting,\" he told reporters. \u201cLook, it took decades to get into this mess. I\u2019ve been at the job less than three weeks, right? I can\u2019t change\u2014 I can\u2019t turn an aircraft carrier overnight,\" Johnson continued. \"But this was a very important first step to get us to the next stage so that we can change how Washington works.\u201d He also said he\u2019s \u201cnot concerned\u201d that passing this CR could weaken his speakership. Johnson ignored a question as he was walking out about whether he was committed to passing a supplemental aid bill for Israel and Ukraine before the next CR passes in early 2024. Scott Wong The conservative House Freedom Caucus officially announced its opposition to Johnson's CR plan this morning. The Freedom Caucus had initially pushed for the two-tiered \u201claddered CR\u201d approach but opposes Johnson\u2019s bill because it lacks spending cuts and conservative policy riders. \u201cThe House Freedom Caucus opposes the proposed \u2018clean\u2019 Continuing Resolution as it contains no spending reductions, no border security, and not a single meaningful win for the American People,\" the group wrote in a press release. Scott Wong After trashing the idea of a two-step strategy to fund the government, House Democrats signaled Monday that they are open to backing Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s plan, significantly lowering the threat of a painful shutdown at the end of the week. With a handful of conservatives rebelling against the stopgap funding bill, it means Johnson, R-La., must receive help from Democrats to get it through the chamber. On Monday afternoon, House Democratic leaders said they are considering supporting the Johnson strategy. And across the Capitol, Johnson\u2019s plan got a bipartisan boost from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggesting the continuing resolution, or CR, is likely to cruise through the Senate if it can first pass out of the House. The House plans to take up the bill Tuesday. Read the full story here. Kyle Stewart The House will vote on Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s two-step continuing resolution this afternoon around 4:30 p.m. Many Democrats are expected to support the bill since the CR does not cut spending or attach other conservative policy riders, but they will formalize their position in a caucus meeting that's happening this morning. This plan funds the government at existing levels in order to avoid a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday. The CR extends funding until Jan. 19 for the agencies dealing with Agriculture, Military Construction/Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The remaining agency appropriations \u2014 for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and Science; Defense; Financial Services; Homeland Security; Interior and Environment; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Legislative Branch; State and foreign operations \u2014 will be extended to Feb. 2. Kyle Stewart Johnson said he was \u201cpleased with the outcome\u201d after his two-step continuing resolution passed the House. \u201cWe just had to get the job done,\u201d he said as he left the House chamber after the vote. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it day by day.\u201d Asked about Republican defections on the bill, Johnson said: \u201cWe\u2019ll get our team together and run the agenda. We\u2019re ready to do that.\u201d Kyle Stewart More Republicans \u2014 93 \u2014 voted against this CR than opposed the last clean funding bill in September. As with the last bill, more Democrats voted for the CR than did Republicans. Only two Democrats voted against the measure today: Reps. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Mike Quigley of Illinois; Quigley was the lone Dem to vote against the September CR. For context, the CR that the House approved Sept. 30 passed on a vote of 335-91. Scott Wong and Kyle Stewart House lawmakers on Tuesday passed Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown, likely punting the GOP\u2019s spending fight until after the holidays. The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to send it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by Friday night to avert a shutdown. Kyle Stewart Typically, the House will vote on a \"rule,\" a procedural vote that paves the way for bills to be passed with a simple majority. Rules are usually passed by the majority party, but Republican leaders are using a different tactic due to conservative opposition. Instead, they are bringing the CR to the floor \u201cunder suspension of the rules.\u201d This means it will need the support of two-thirds of the chamber to pass. This change was made because it was clear that there would not be enough Republican votes to pass the rule, but Democrats seem willing to vote to pass the bill itself. Sarah Mimms The House is now voting on the CR. Two-thirds of the House will need to vote yea to pass it. Sarah Mimms The House was expected to vote on the CR between 4:30-5:30 p.m. ET, but they're handling a series of unrelated amendment votes that are taking a while. Each of these votes is supposed to be a \"two-minute vote,\" but they often go over time. The vote on the actual CR is the last in this vote series and should happen within the hour. Frank Thorp V Senate Republicans are trying to use the fact that there is no pending business before the Senate \u2014 because they\u2019re waiting for the House to pass this CR so they can start considering it \u2014 to try to force consideration of the House-passed Israel aid bill. Democrats support aid for Israel but oppose the House's bill because it cuts funding to ramp up IRS enforcement. As a result, it would add billions to the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Kyle Stewart The House will vote on Johnson\u2019s two-step continuing resolution in the next vote series, scheduled to start around 4:30 p.m. It will be the 11th vote of the series, so it will likely come up closer to 5:30 p.m. Scott Wong House Dem leadership endorsed Johnson's two-step CR in a statement before the vote, saying it\u2019s \u201cdevoid of harmful cuts and free of extreme right-wing policy riders.\" \"We will support it,\" leadership said. \"Moving forward, it is important that Congress comes together to advance the supplemental national security and domestic policy funding requested by President Joe Biden,\" they continued. Marley Jay If the federal government shuts down Saturday, numerous publicly funded agencies will stop work and their employees won\u2019t be paid, but Social Security checks will still go out. Social Security is considered a mandatory program, and it isn\u2019t funded by the shorter-term appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. That means its operations and funding don\u2019t stop when the government shuts down. That\u2019s important for a large proportion of Americans, as about 67 million people receive monthly Social Security benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.

        "title": "Biden-Xi meeting offers both leaders opportunities \u2014 and risks",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Simply by sitting down with his Chinese counterpart Wednesday, President Joe Biden may go a long way toward calming voters who fear that the two global powers are on a march to war. After a fraught year marked by near misses in the skies between U.S. and Chinese warplanes, both Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping need the meeting that\u2019s set to take place in California, if for no other reason than to reassure a jittery world audience that they are once again talking, foreign policy experts said.   Before he left Tuesday for San Francisco, Biden told reporters that the purpose of the meeting is \u201cto get back on a normal course of corresponding: being able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there\u2019s a crisis, being able to make sure our militaries still have contact with one another.\u201d Each president seems to have space back home to ease tensions, polling suggests. A Morning Consult survey showed that the share of Chinese adults who view the U.S. in hostile terms has dropped 9 points since April. Another survey found that only 13% of U.S. voters wanted an aggressive approach toward China, while a majority worried more about open conflict with China than about the U.S.\u2019 not appearing tough enough in its dealings with Beijing. Such trends could blunt a potential line of attack against Biden from Donald Trump, the Republican presidential primary front-runner. In the 2020 campaign, Trump sought to paint Biden as soft on China, an accusation he\u2019s likely to repeat in a rematch. But the public\u2019s mood suggests that Biden could gain traction with more moderate and independent-minded voters by pursuing a dialogue with Xi and eschewing the hawkish stance many in Trump\u2019s orbit embrace. \u201cI can understand why Republicans who are worried about being primaried want to keep doing this red meat stuff,\u201d said David Loevinger, a former senior U.S. Treasury official in charge of China policy. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going after the center, I think people would rather have talk than conflict.\u201d Yet the meeting carries risks for Biden ahead of the presidential election. If China takes actions after the summit that run counter to U.S. interests, Biden could open himself to accusations that for all the stagecraft and summitry, he was outmatched. The two leaders will cover a variety of thorny subjects, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and they aren\u2019t expected to reach major accords. Any agreement that comes out of the summit is likely to involve more modest efforts to revive military hotlines that have broken down in recent years, regulate the fast-evolving advances in artificial intelligence and stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. from China, experts said. The summit \u201cwill get a lot of attention, but I\u2019m not expecting big, sweeping agreements that will change the course of the world,\u201d said Victor Cha, a former White House National Security Council official. \u201cThe broader indicators are that these two countries are on this long-term competitive track.\u201d But it may be a rare instance in which a face-to-face meeting is itself a breakthrough. It will be the first time Biden and Xi have met in person since they spoke a year ago at a summit meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Since then, relations between the two have been strained by the Chinese spy balloon that floated over the U.S. and harrowing encounters in the air and sea lanes between China and Taiwan, the self-ruling island that China claims as its own. In June, Biden referred to Xi as \u201ca dictator,\u201d a slur that caught even senior U.S. officials off-guard. At the closed-door summit, whose location has been kept secret for security reasons, Biden is expected to press Xi to use his leverage to stop North Korea from supplying weapons to Russia in its war with Ukraine. Another of Biden\u2019s aims is to get Xi to persuade Iran not to use its proxies in the Middle East to combat Israel in its war with Hamas. \u201cPresident Biden will make the point to President Xi that Iran acting in an escalatory, destabilizing way that undermines stability across the broader Middle East is not in the interest of the PRC or of any other responsible country,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters at a briefing Monday, using the initialism for People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cAnd the PRC, of course, has a relationship with Iran, and it\u2019s capable, if it chooses, of making those points directly to the Iranian government.\u201d Having laid out what he wants of Xi, Biden can ill afford for Xi to defy him and permit Iranian and North Korean meddling in the two wars. Biden has billed himself as a deft negotiator on the world stage, and he could face a backlash if relations with China deteriorate after the summit. As for Xi, he would like to see fewer high-level visits to Taiwan from U.S. officials, former diplomats said. He may also use the meeting to drive home a point he made in March, when he accused the U.S. and the West of making moves that amount to the \u201ccontainment, encirclement and suppression of China,\u201d impeding its development. With so much on the agenda, the meeting could well surpass the three-hour session the two had in Bali. When it is finished, Biden will hold a news conference at which he is expected to emphasize points of agreement rather than paint Xi as a threat. In the run-up to the summit, past and current U.S. officials have pointed to weaknesses in the Chinese economy as a reason Xi may want to take a more cooperative stance. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to decouple from China,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is change the relationship for the better. From my perspective, if ... the average citizen of China was able to have a decent-paying job, that benefits them and it benefits all of us.\u201d Much can go wrong \u2014 for both men. The Chinese are sensitive to slights and breaches of protocol. Were they to get out of hand, any of the planned protests in San Francisco could quickly overwhelm the summit. In 2006, when then-Chinese President Hu Jintao visited George W. Bush at the White House, a heckler disrupted the carefully staged welcome ceremony. \"The Chinese complained about that for two months afterward,\" Cha recalled. Biden has his own worries. Unless Congress passes a spending bill, the U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Biden hasn't ruled out returning early from San Francisco, where he's also attending a summit of Asian-Pacific economies, to keep the government up and running. An early exit would prove embarrassing for Biden, who has sought to portray democracy as a better governing model than autocracy. A shutdown, Sullivan cautioned, \"would send a signal to the world that the United States cannot pull together on a bipartisan basis to sustain government funding and to show a united face to the world at a moment where you see this turbulence around the world.\" Peter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "House passes a stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House lawmakers on Tuesday passed Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown, most likely punting the GOP's spending fight until after the holidays. The vote was 336-95, with 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans voting to support it. Ninety-three Republicans voted against it, more than voted against the last government funding bill in September; two Democrats opposed it: Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Mike Quigley of Illinois. Because of the way leadership structured the vote, it needed support from two-thirds of the full House to pass. \"We just had to get the job done,\" Johnson, R-La., said after the vote. The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to send it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by Friday night to avert a shutdown. Johnson's so-called laddered continuing resolution, or CR, would fund part of the government \u2014 including the Agriculture, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Affairs departments \u2014 through Jan. 19 and fund the Defense Department and other remaining parts of the government through Feb. 2. Follow live updates on the stopgap bill vote The CR is \"clean,\" with no spending cuts or contentious policy provisions that would alienate Democrats. It also does not include a supplemental package covering things like aid for Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance or border security, leaving those issues for later in the year. Facing a host of conservative defections, Johnson needed Democratic support to get his bill through the House. Moments before the vote, House Democratic leaders endorsed his plan, guaranteeing its passage. \"House Democrats have repeatedly articulated that any continuing resolution must be set at the fiscal year 2023 spending level, be devoid of harmful cuts and free of extreme right-wing policy riders,\" the Democratic leaders said in a joint statement. \"The continuing resolution before the House today meets that criteria and we will support it.\" Keeping the government's lights on into the New Year would buy more time for House Republicans to pass all 12 appropriations bills and for House and Senate negotiators to hammer out a broader deal. The CR also would give agitated lawmakers, who've been in session for 10 straight weeks, a chance to take a break from one another. \"I've been drinking from Niagara Falls the last three weeks. This will allow everybody to go home for a couple of days for Thanksgiving, everybody cool off,\" Johnson told reporters. \"Members have been here ... for 10 weeks. This place is a pressure cooker,\" he said. \"And so I think everybody can go home, we can come back, reset. ... We're going to map out that plan to fight for those principles.\" Earlier Tuesday, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., kept his cards close to the vest, saying Democrats were still evaluating Johnson's laddered proposal. But inside a closed-door meeting, Jeffries told rank-and-file Democrats about the CR, \"This is OK. We can live with this,\" according to a member of his leadership team in attendance. However, two top appropriators \u2014 Reps. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. \u2014 argued in the room that Democrats cannot be a \u201ccheap date\u201d and help Johnson pass the CR without getting something in return, according to a source present at the meeting. DeLauro and Wasserman Schultz said they wanted a path forward on topline spending numbers and agreements on funding caps for the 12 spending bills, while others pushed for assurances that the House will vote on Israel and Ukraine aid. Johnson's clean CR needed to rely on Democratic votes, just like the last funding bill, which cost Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., his job in early October. The House conservatives who helped oust McCarthy from power despise CRs in general, and on Tuesday morning, the far-right House Freedom Caucus said its members had taken a position opposing the laddered CR, even though it was originally proposed by Freedom Caucus members. It \"contains no spending reductions, no border security, and not a single meaningful win for the American People,\" the Freedom Caucus said in its statement. Defending his strategy, Johnson argued that the CR would help Republicans tackle spending and debt in the future. \"We are not surrendering; we are fighting. But you have to be wise about choosing the fights,\" he said. \"You got to fight fights that you can win.\" \"This was a very important first step to get us to the next stage so that we can change how Washington works,\" he said. With Johnson having been in the job for less than three weeks, there has been no discussion among Republicans about an effort to remove him over the CR. \"I don\u2019t like the bill. I like Speaker Johnson,\u201d said Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy. \u201cSpeaker Johnson has been on the job for what, two or three weeks now? ... The reason why Speaker Johnson finds himself in the position he is in is because of nine months of failure under Speaker McCarthy.\u201d Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., another one of the group McCarthy has dubbed the \"Hateful Eight,\" also cast blame on the former speaker. \"Speaker McCarthy had since January, and then he started working on it two weeks out before the deadline and after we had taken six weeks off, and dagnabbit, we should have been here working,\" Burchett said. \"I think people will be unhappy and uncomfortable with it,\" he said of Johnson's CR, but he added that he thinks Johnson will survive through the 2024 election. \"I think he's going to be a great speaker,\" he said.

        "title": "Campaign fundraiser for Rep. George Santos pleads guilty to fraud charge",
        "content": "A former campaign staffer for Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal wire fraud charge stemming from his work for the embattled congressman. Samuel Miele, 27, was charged in August with wire fraud and identity theft for having posed as a top aide to then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., while he was raising money for Santos' 2022 campaign. Prosecutors said Miele used the aide's identity with over a dozen potential donors, raising money for Santos while enriching himself through 15% commissions on each donation. In his plea, Miele also admitted that he charged credit cards without authorization for contributions to the campaigns of \"Candidate #1\" \u2014 Santos \u2014 and other campaigns, as well as himself, prosecutors said. In a plea form filed with the judge, Miele said that from August to December 2021, \"I pretended I was the Chief of Staff to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in some telephone calls and emails with potential donors, including an email on August 19, 2021, which used interstate wires. I did that to help me raise funds for the congressional campaign I was working on.\" \"In addition, between November of 2020 and January of this year, I caused approximately $100,000 to be charged to several donors\u2019 credit cards without their permission. I used some of those funds as donations to a candidate for Congress and some for my own expenses,\" Miele said on the form. Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement that Miele had \u201cused fraud and deceit to steal more than one hundred thousand dollars from his victims, funneling this money into the campaign committees of candidates for the House, and into his own pockets.\u201d As part of the plea deal, prosecutors said, Miele agreed to pay $109,171 in restitution, $69,136 in forfeiture and $470,000 to a campaign contributor. He also faces a maximum of 20 years behind bars when he's sentenced April 30. Santos' attorney, Joe Murray, was in court to watch the proceeding and declined to comment to NBC New York afterward. Miele's lawyer, Kevin Marino, wouldn't say whether his client was cooperating with the investigation. \"Mr. Miele has accepted responsibility\" for his actions and \"looks forward to putting this behind him,\" Marino told NBC New York. Santos, who faces separate fraud charges, told The Associated Press in August that he fired Miele in 2021 after he learned about the scam from the McCarthy aide. Santos' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors said Miele sent Santos a letter last year trying to explain his actions. The indictment said that in the letter Miele acknowledged \"faking\" his \"identity to a big donor\" but that Miele also described himself as \"high risk, high reward in everything I do.'\" Last month, Santos' former campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, pleaded guilty to charges that implicated Santos in wrongdoing, including falsifying campaign forms so he could get matching funds he wasn't entitled to. Santos, who had been charged in May with 13 criminal counts, was hit with 10 additional charges in a superseding indictment days after Marks\u2019 plea. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintained he's the victim of a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" Santos, who has acknowledged fabricating and exaggerating chunks of his background, survived an effort this month by his fellow House Republicans from New York to expel him from Congress.

        "title": "Undocumented immigrants here for decades ask Biden for work permits: can it be done?",
        "content": "Many recently arrived Venezuelans celebrated when the Biden administration granted those who were eligible the chance to work in the United States. Consuelo Martinez said she felt deep sadness. Martinez, originally from Mexico, and her husband have worked in the U.S. for 27 years, without permission and in constant fear of being caught by immigration officers, she said by phone in Spanish. \u201cWhen I heard that my Venezuelan brothers and sisters, the president, overnight, gave them permission to work, I became sad. I became very, very sad,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI cried. I cried because I am 27 years waiting in line, 27 years, so that they can give me permission to work, so I can go to work without fear, I can work calmly, without stress.\u201d Martinez had traveled to Washington from Chicago on Tuesday along with hundreds of other immigrants, employers and advocates. Organizers said 2,219 people were bused in. They marched to Lafayette Square across from the White House to ask President Joe Biden to use his executive powers to give them a chance to get work permits, as well. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. The rally comes amid a lack of any congressional legislation on immigration and decades of Republican legal challenges to expanding work permits and deferred deportations for immigrants who lack legal status but have spent decades living and working in the U.S. In September, Biden extended Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans here since before July 31, which authorizes them to work. Biden was responding to pressure from New York and other cities that have been struggling to house, clothe and feed the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who have left political and economic upheaval in their country. While the action opened a relief valve for cities and immigration advocates, it left undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for a long time \u2014 and who have been hoping for Congress or one of multiple presidents to give them a similar privilege \u2014 to wonder, what about us? But Biden cannot extend Temporary Protected Status, which is granted to people whose countries have experienced disasters or political upheavals, to all immigrants, said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and the director of its New York University School of Law office. Biden has allowed Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans into the U.S. through humanitarian parole because of situations in their countries and the rising numbers of people from them arriving at the border. But Republicans are challenging the action in court, making an extension to another group risky, Chishti said. Advocates also propose providing work permits to immigrants through a program like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which allowed younger immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to work and study in two-year intervals. But Republicans have also challenged DACA, and a separate program President Barack Obama created for parents of undocumented children, known as DAPA, was short-circuited by the courts. \"One supports this as a moral issue, but there's no legal basis for doing it,\" Chishti said. \"The president cannot give authorization unless he has an underlying authority for the category that is eligible for compensation.\" Groups that participated in the rally, including business groups, point out that the country is experiencing labor shortages that could give Biden the justification to expand work permits to immigrants who lack legal status. \u201cFor many of our employers, trying to legalize the undocumented workforce is a North Star,\u201d said Rebecca Shi, the executive director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, \u201cand seeing the president is able to grant work permits to the new migrants has really excited us \u2014 can you also extend that to the long-term undocumented immigrants who have been picking our crops, cooking delicious meals, designing and constructing homes and even semiconductors?\u201d More than any other administration, Shi said, Biden's has provided work permits to new migrants \u2014 Venezuelans, Cubans, Ukrainians and others. \"This has shown us, including the employers, that there is broad legal authority from the president,\" said Shi, whose group was leading the \"Here to Work\" march and campaign. About 11.2 million people lived in the U.S. without legal permission in 2021, having either entered the country without permission or stayed after visas expired, said the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The majority are adults. While that was a slight increase over 2019, the undocumented population has hovered at about 11 million for 15 years, it reported. Of those, 63% had been in the U.S. a decade or more, 43% for 15 or more years and about 22% for 20 or more years. Congress has, over almost the same time, become increasingly divided over immigration and allowed the undocumented workforce to grow, stymied by groups' differences and unable to reconcile itself with the always changing dynamics of immigration. Meanwhile, in the last couple of decades, the numbers of people arriving at the border have spiked, with more arrivals from countries other than Mexico than in the past. In addition, more migrants are surrendering to immigration officials and asking for asylum. Shi said the permits are doable if Biden deals with the undocumented population in buckets, giving the chance to work first to the approximately 1.1 million undocumented people married to U.S. citizens, the same way the government already allows spouses of members of the military to work and become citizens. Then he could allow work permits and deportation deferrals for 1.2 million immigrants who have been in the country since they were children, often called Dreamers, who do not have DACA status and are graduating from high school and college but cannot work legally. He could also provide permits to hundreds of thousands of agriculture workers, and so on. Sergio Suarez, an entrepreneur with 14 businesses of various types, said some migrants have worked 30 years in the U.S. and still do not have Social Security cards to permit them to work. Suarez is an immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years. Some in Congress had pressed the administration for worker permits for Venezuelans and are pushing for the same for others. At the rally, Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda, D-Ill., insisted Biden had the authority to provide the work permits for immigrants who have been here for years. \"We recognize that immigration reform has eluded Congress for 36 years,\" Garcia said at the rally, reminding the crowd he is the son of braceros, the name for mostly Mexican immigrants who worked in the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1960s, largely in agriculture, to ease labor shortages beginning in World War II. \"People want to continue to work in peace. They want to be able to go to work without fear of deportation or being apprehended,\" he said. \"Those are the asks that we make of President Biden and this White House.\" Suzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC Latino and NBCNews.com ",

        "title": "Chris Christie visits Israel, speaks with survivors of Oct. 7 Hamas attack",
        "content": "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the weekend became the first Republican presidential candidate to go to Israel since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, visiting a hospital in Tel Aviv, meeting with victims who were wounded in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack and speaking to relatives of people it took hostage. Christie started the day touring Kfar Aza kibbutz, less than 2 miles from the Gaza border, which Hamas attacked on Oct. 7. He walked through debris in the community, wearing a bulletproof vest and looking at houses Hamas destroyed and hearing stories about the atrocities that took place.  Christie told NBC News before he left for Israel that his goal was to ask a lot of questions and then listen. And in Israel, he said he planned to regularly relay what he heard back in the U.S. so \u201cAmerican people who were being asked to sacrifice and to help Israel financially and militarily will know that what they\u2019re doing is not only a noble effort on their part, but also what friends do for friends. And America has no greater friend in the world than Israel.\u201d Christie also said he hopes his visit inspires other U.S. leaders to go, adding, \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand the stakes after seeing this, then you lost.\u201d Follow live coverage here. And when he was asked how he thought President Joe Biden has responded to the war, Christie said he thinks Biden\u2019s performance since Oct. 7 \u201chas been quite good.\u201d  \u201cI think that he has done the things that needed to be done to be able to show Israel our friendship and our support and also send signals to others in this area that the United States is not going to permit these kinds of things to go on,\u201d Christie said.  Among the people Christie spoke to at the Tel Aviv hospital was Sheerel Gabay, who was shot in the knee in a bomb shelter at a music festival on Oct. 7 and hid under dead bodies for seven hours before she was rescued. A soldier named Yadin, a reserve first responder who did not provide his last name, was wounded fighting Hamas on Oct. 7. \u201cAs American citizens, we have a lot of friends abroad that live in America, Europe or Canada, and we hear a lot of voices that are so against us,\u201d Yadin told Christie. \u201cWhen you hear a story like Sheerel\u2019s and you hear that people just came into a bomb shelter and shot innocent people ... you ask yourself questions of moral humanity, and I feel like the world has lost that.\u201d At the kibbutz, Maj. Liad Diamond, a member of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Public Diplomacy Department, told Christie that a five-person American family who used to live there would fly kites every Friday night so people in Gaza could see them, seemingly as a sign of peace. The family members were killed in their safe room. Amir Ohana, the speaker of Israel\u2019s Knesset, told Christie after they toured the kibbutz, \u201cTerror organizations throughout the world are watching, what will Israel and what will the world respond to what happened on Oct. 7.\u201d After his stop at the kibbutz, Christie toured an Israeli military encampment in Tzifrim, where he watched more than 40 minutes of video highlighting what happened on Oct. 7 and was shown weapons Hamas used in the attack. Video of the attacks previously screened by the IDF has included clips from social media and from both Israeli rescuers and Hamas attackers, among other sources. \u201cI saw some of the weapons that were used from Hamas, and they had Russian weapons, they had Iranian weapons, they had North Korean weapons, they are all working together,\u201d Christie later told victims at the hospital. \u201cThey are all evil, and they want to go after Israel not only because they hate Jews, but also because they hate us.\u201d Christie also met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, but he did not meet with any Palestinian leaders. Asked whether there should be a cease-fire, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d  His message to people calling for a cease-fire is \u201ccome to Israel and see it for yourself.\u201d NBC News asked Christie how seeing images of children and other civilians in Gaza made him feel. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible consequence of the war that Hamas started. Let\u2019s remember on Oct. 6, there was a cease-fire. And Oct. 7, Hamas violated it and violated it by killing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians.\u201d Emma Barnett is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed. ",

        "title": "Paul Pelosi attack suspect surprisingly takes the stand to testify in his own defense",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The man who broke into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home last year unexpectedly testified in his own defense Tuesday, delivering rambling explanations for the hammer attack on her husband \u2014 an act he said he regrets because they had \"a good rapport.\" Defense lawyers for David DePape have conceded their client broke into the Pelosi home in Pacific Heights on Oct. 28, 2022, and hit Paul Pelosi with a hammer. DePape has pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. The defense said DePape never intended to harm either Nancy or Paul Pelosi. After breaking into the home and jarring Paul Pelosi out of bed, DePape said he felt comfortable around him. \"We kinda had a good rapport going,\" DePape testified. \"He was an amiable gentleman. We had a good rapport going, and I kinda trusted him.\" When officers arrived, DePape said he hit Pelosi once, though police body camera footage showed it was three times. Defense attorney Angela Chuang asked her client why he hit Paul Pelosi. \"To get to my other targets,\" DePape testified, adding, \"I felt really bad for him because we had a good rapport, and Paul was never a target.\" The defense has said DePape's plans were to use Nancy and Paul Pelosi to lure a person the government has labeled \"Target 1.\" That person has been identified by local prosecutors and the defense, for which she testified Tuesday, as Bay Area scholar and University of Michigan professor Gayle Rubin, a leading academic in feminist theory and queer studies. DePape rattled off a long list of grievances  \u2014 many of which regularly echo through far right circles \u2014 that led to the night he broke into the Pelosi home. He said that before his arrest, he spent six hours a day looking for political commentary on YouTube. \"Everything was a lie coming from the press,\" said DePape, wearing a zip up blue-gray cardigan and tan khakis. He was emotional at times, dropping expletives, crying and clasping his hands in prayer. The jury did not show any reaction to DePape's testimony.  After a courtroom break, U.S. District Court Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley asked a marshal to sit near DePape, in apparent concern that the defendant might act erratically. During cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Vartain Horn asked DePape if he knew that breaking into Pelosi's home would likely lead to violence. \"Wasn\u2019t my intention, but a possibility, yes,\" he said. And when Horn asked DePape if he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, the defendant tried to hedge his answer. \"I believe that\u2019s a mischaracterization,\" DePape responded. Trial testimony concluded Tuesday afternoon, and closing arguments are set to begin Wednesday morning. Chris Young reported from San Francisco, and David K. Li from New York City.

        "title": "Michigan judge denies effort to keep Trump off 2024 ballot",
        "content": "A Michigan judge on Tuesday dismissed an effort to keep former President Donald Trump off the state\u2019s ballot in 2024. The judge said that under Michigan law, the secretary of state does not have the authority to intervene in a primary election if the party chooses to list a candidate who would not qualify for the office. \u201cThe ultimate decision is made by the respective political party, with the consent of the listed candidate,\u201d the judge wrote. The decision comes after a group of Michigan voters in September filed a legal challenge to Trump\u2019s candidacy, arguing that his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his and conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, making him ineligible for office. The decision by the Michigan Court of Claims did not squarely address or focus on the lawsuit's allegations that Trump \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d after having sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution \u2014 the crux of the petitioners' argument for his disqualification from holding office. Ron Fein, an attorney for the petitioners, said Tuesday that an appeal was forthcoming. \"While our appeal is pending, the trial court\u2019s decision isn\u2019t binding on any other court, and we continue our current and planned legal actions in other states to enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment against Donald Trump,\" Fein, the legal director of Free Speech For People, said in a statement. Tuesday's ruling is another victory for Trump after the Minnesota Supreme Court this month dismissed a similar legal bid to keep him off the state\u2019s primary ballot in 2024. Trump has dismissed such efforts as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201celection interference.\u201d Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, welcomed the Michigan ruling. \"Each and every one of these ridiculous cases have LOST because they are all un-Constitutional left-wing fantasies orchestrated by monied allies of the Biden campaign seeking to turn the election over to the courts and deny the American people the right to choose their next president,\" Cheung said in a statement, adding that he anticipated similar wins in other efforts to disqualify Trump's candidacy on the basis of the 14th Amendment. Top election officials in Arizona, New Hampshire and elsewhere are also weighing concerns similar to those raised in Michigan as they prepare state ballots for next year\u2019s Republican presidential primaries, where Trump is leading in the polls among GOP candidates.

        "title": "Speaker Mike Johnson says separation of church and state is a 'misnomer'",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday explained his long-held opinion that the concept of the separation of church and state is often misinterpreted. \"The separation of church and state is a misnomer,\" Johnson said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"People misunderstand it,\" he continued. \"Of course, it comes from a phrase that was in a letter that Jefferson wrote. It\u2019s not in the Constitution. And what he was explaining is they did not want the government to encroach upon the church \u2014 not that they didn\u2019t want principles of faith to have influence on our public life. It\u2019s exactly the opposite.\" The question came after the host recalled that the new speaker had prayed on the House floor after he was sworn into his new role last month. Johnson suggested Tuesday that the nation's founders believed religion and morality were central to the government. \"They knew that it would be important to maintain our system,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s why I think we need more of that \u2014 not an establishment of any national religion \u2014 but we need everybody\u2019s vibrant expression of faith because it\u2019s such an important part of who we are as a nation.\" While it is technically true that the words \"separation of church and state\" are not written in the Constitution, many legal scholars have said that the phrase is a reference to the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment. For his part, Johnson has spent the better part of the last two decades advocating for religious freedom in public schools, in government and in public places, mainly as an attorney for the conservative Christian group, Alliance Defense Fund, now known as Alliance Defending Freedom. In that role, he wrote in a 2006 editorial that the ACLU and its allies had used what he called the \"misleading\" separation of church and state \"metaphor\" to intimidate public officials and to censor religious people. \"The Bible is and should be an appropriate course of study in our public schools,\" he wrote in another op-ed in 2007. \"Because it is the most widely read, widely published, most influential book in all of history, censoring it from the classroom is as unwise as it is unnecessary.\" In 2017, Johnson and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, also a Republican, created guidelines for the use of religion in school, which argued that the study of the Bible or religion in public school is \"perfectly lawful,\" echoing an argument Johnson had made before. At an event for students with Landry in 2018, Johnson told the audience that the separation of church and state is often taken out of context because it appeared in a letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1802. \u201cThey were concerned that the state was going to inhibit on their free exercise of religion,\u201d Johnson said. \"But Jefferson says, 'Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve separated the government so that the government will not meddle into your free exercise rights.\u2019\" In 2019, Johnson expressed outrage at a House committee hearing when Democrats omitted \"so help me God\" from the swearing-in of witnesses. He later said it was part of a coordinated effort by Democrats to strike that phrase from language used in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me, personally, as a Christian, but I\u2019m a constitutional attorney and history buff and this isn\u2019t controversial,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cEveryone who hears about this should be outraged.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.

The Grieving Families Act would permit loved ones to also sue for emotional loss, including grief, anguish and loss of companionship.  Alabama is the other state without such a provision, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group and the American Association for Justice.  New York resident Bruce McIntyre, 31, said he might benefit if the measure becomes law and if he wins a lawsuit he filed after his partner, Amber Rose Isaac, 26, died in childbirth in 2020. The lawsuit against Montefiore Medical Center in New York alleges doctors missed repeated signs of HELLP Syndrome, a rare, life-threatening pregnancy complication that can cause serious blood and liver problems if left untreated. Isaac was diagnosed with it shortly before childbirth. McIntyre says multiple physicians ignored Isaac\u2019s health concerns throughout her pregnancy, after she complained of dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath and chest pain. \u201cShe had feelings she wasn\u2019t going to make it,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cDue to how much she was being neglected. She\u2019s just being told these are irregular pregnancy-related complications \u2014 really nothing that she should worry about.\u201d McIntyre\u2019s lawsuit is ongoing, and in a statement to NBC News, Montefiore Medical Center declined to comment, citing pending litigation and patient privacy regulations. New York\u2019s current law can sometimes lead to \u201cproblematic\u201d payout calculations because it has a built-in bias against people of color and women, who traditionally earn less than men, said Nora Engstrom, a professor at Stanford Law School.  \u201cIt values the life of a person who was a high-wage earner much more than someone who is a low-wage earner,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also cements past structural racism, and it also tends to value men\u2019s lives much more than women\u2019s lives.\u201d Ruth Whitfield, 86, was killed in a mass shooting last year at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, when a white gunman opened fire and killed 10 Black people. Whitfield was the oldest victim. Her son, Garnell Whitfield, said the current law devalues his mother\u2019s contributions because she was a stay-at-home mother. \u201cFor her life not to be valued because of her chosen profession, because of her age, or because of any other circumstances, is outrageous,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was invaluable.\u201d Opponents of the Grieving Families Act say that overhauling the wrongful death calculation would lead to higher health insurance premiums and liability costs for medical malpractice.  \u201cIf you drive up the cost of liability insurance, you\u2019re going to lose more physicians,\u201d said Dr. Paul Pipia, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York. \u201cWhen you lose physicians from New York, it\u2019s going to increase the time for patients to see those doctors.\u201d Hochul vetoed a previous version of the bill in January over similar concerns. She is reviewing an updated version that would include a shorter statute of limitations, and new restrictions on who qualifies as a victim\u2019s close family member. For McIntyre, the Grieving Families Act is not just about compensation, but also about holding others to account.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put a price tag on Amber,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just another statistic.\u201d Zoe Rohrich is an associate producer for NBC News.

        "title": "'Stand your butt up': Fistfight nearly breaks out during Senate hearing until Bernie Sanders steps in",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tensions erupted on Capitol Hill on Tuesday after a fistfight nearly broke out in a Senate hearing and a Republican congressman accused former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of assaulting him. At a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, an argument almost turned into a fistfight between GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O'Brien. The exchange occurred when Mullin, a former MMA fighter, recalled an interaction he had with O'Brien in June on Twitter, now known as X. At the time, they discussed engaging in an MMA fight for charity after they had gotten into a heated back-and-forth at a previous congressional hearing. Mullin read aloud O'Brien's original tweet at the hearing Tuesday: \"Greedy CEO who pretends like he\u2019s self made. In reality, just a clown & fraud. Always has been, always will be. Quit the tough guy act in these senate hearings. You know where to find me. Anyplace, Anytime cowboy.\" The tweet also said \"#LittleManSyndrome\" and showed a photo of Mullin at a debate where he was standing on a pedestal at a podium. Mullin then said at the hearing: \"Sir, this is a time; this is a place. You want to run your mouth? We can be two consenting adults. We can finish it here.\" \"OK, that\u2019s fine, perfect,\" O'Brien said. \"You want to do it now?\" Mullin replied. \"I'd love to do it right now,\" O'Brien said. \"Then stand your butt up then,\" said Mullin. \"You stand your butt up,\" said O'Brien. Mullin then stood up and the committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., stopped the altercation from happening, yelling at Mullin: \u201cStop it! No, no, sit down! You know, you\u2019re a United States senator.\" The entire episode devolved, with Mullin and O'Brien calling each other names not normally heard in committee hearings, but they did not get physical. The two appeared to conclude their exchange by agreeing to have coffee together. On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who voted to oust McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker last month, said that McCarthy had elbowed him in the kidneys while Burchett was speaking to reporters in a hallway. Burchett said he believes it was intentional, telling reporters: \"Oh, it was 100% on purpose, ma\u2019am, what are the chances ... 435 members of Congress, eight of us voted against him. I\u2019m the one who did it, one of them who did it. He publicly called me out.\" Burchett said that he chased after McCarthy to confront him and that the former speaker didn't know what Burchett was talking about. McCarthy denied that he attacked Burchett, telling reporters, \"If I\u2019d kidney-punched him, he\u2019d be on the ground.\" Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who spearheaded the push to oust McCarthy, filed a complaint to the House Ethics Committee about the incident. Gaetz did not witness the incident himself, but anyone can file a complaint. Asked about the ethics complaint, McCarthy said, \u201cI think Ethics is a good place for Gaetz to be.\u201d A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., seemed to react to both incidents on X. \"Today is another example of why Congress shouldn\u2019t be in session for 5 weeks straight. Weird things happen.\" McConnell told reporters he hadn't heard about the incidents but said it is \"very difficult to control the behavior of everybody who\u2019s in the building. I don\u2019t view that as my responsibility. That\u2019s something that the Capitol Police have to deal with.\u201d Frank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.

        "title": "For Tim Scott and his supporters, what\u2019s next is unclear",
        "content": "Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s sudden departure from the GOP presidential primary won\u2019t be accompanied by an endorsement for one of his rivals anytime soon, three people in Scott\u2019s orbit told NBC News. But Scott\u2019s donors and voters are very much looking for what\u2019s next \u2014 and his fellow primary candidates are keen on swaying them. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged his presidential campaign\u2019s national finance committee on a private conference call to recruit Scott\u2019s donors, NBC News reported. Meanwhile, a Scott donor already organized a fundraiser for former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, as Bloomberg reported. Representatives for Haley and Trump did not respond to NBC News when asked if they were actively courting Scott\u2019s support. While DeSantis\u2019 campaign declined to comment on such an effort, it did say in a statement they felt best positioned to pick up evangelical voters in Iowa who were drawn to Scott and former Vice President Mike Pence, who also recently dropped out of the race. \u201cTim Scott and Mike Pence were surging resources in Iowa, looking to attract evangelical supporters, and unlike Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis is making headway with those voters,\u201d Andrew Romeo, DeSantis\u2019 communications director, said. \u201cIn the coming weeks, these voters will see that Nikki Haley\u2019s record and values don\u2019t match her rhetoric.\u201d It\u2019s not clear, however, that DeSantis is in the best position to pick up Scott\u2019s supporters. The most recent NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of Iowa, which showed former President Donald Trump with 43% and Haley and DeSantis tied at 16%, found that Scott\u2019s support is pretty evenly distributed among Trump, Haley and DeSantis when assigned to his backers\u2019 second choice. What is clear for the moment is that Scott himself won\u2019t be urging his former backers to get behind another candidate, as he told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to endorse, especially in the near term. I can guarantee you that,\u201d one Scott campaign official told NBC News, saying the senator will aim his focus on Israel and upcoming budget fights. \u201cI do not see a world in the next weeks ahead where he\u2019s going to come out for Nikki, Ron or Donald.\u201d  Shery Smith, a Scott backer and school board member in Sumter County, South Carolina, said it\u2019s way too soon to know just how his supporters will break. She\u2019s still grappling with where to go, too. \u201cA lot of people are shocked,\u201d she said, adding she does not expect Scott to endorse ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cA lot of folks are disappointed.\u201d In South Carolina, one Trump ally said they did not think Scott was getting out of the race in hopes of boosting either the former president or one of his challengers, saying the move from Scott was strategic in boosting his own image. The senator, who was rarely attacked by rivals on the campaign trail, leaves the race without suffering a potentially disappointing finish in Iowa or, even worse, a crushing loss in his home state. \u201cGetting out now also preserves a lot of his financial resources,\u201d this person said, \u201cwhich could make him formidable in whatever he decides to do next.\u201d This person said it is their expectation that Trump will be the biggest beneficiary of Scott\u2019s departure from the race, though. Trump has led Haley in recent polls of South Carolina by at least 25 percentage points, while Scott typically registered in the high single-digits. \u201cSome people were just loyal enough to Tim Scott to give him their vote\u201d over Trump, the Trump ally said. \u201cAnd I would expect a shift in a lot of those voters towards President Trump.\u201d In summarizing why Scott\u2019s campaign fell short, his allies said it was simple: From the day Scott announced, Trump\u2019s primary standing only grew stronger. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously consolidation happening,\u201d one Scott ally said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a good amount of time between now and Iowa. But it\u2019s going to become increasingly difficult as Donald Trump continues to suck up so much of the oxygen.\u201d Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Throngs gather for March for Israel rally at D.C.'s National Mall to condemn antisemitism",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered at the National Mall on Tuesday for a rally in support of Israel and against the antisemitism and bias incidents that have erupted in the U.S. since the start of the Gaza war. The March for Israel rally came as the war between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth week and with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continuing to reject calls for a cease-fire. \u201cThis is the moment to speak up for ourselves and be united in support of Israel,\u201d said 21-year-old Indiana University student Jared Cohen. Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict The death toll in Gaza continued to climb and Palestinians trapped there by the fighting faced a dire humanitarian crisis, many hiding in packed hospitals that were struggling to treat patients while fuel, food and power remained in short supply. The latest convulsion of violence in the Holy Land erupted Oct. 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostages. Tahl Ben-Yehuda, 53, a cantor from Overland Park, Kansas, said she came to be a voice for two of her cousins, Keith and Aviva Siegel, who had been taken by Hamas. \u201cThose hostages need to be freed,\u201d Ben-Yehuda said. \u201cIsrael is living right now with an existential threat. It is simply not OK to let 240 people be held as hostages. The world needs to rise.\u201d Organizers of Tuesday's event said they are not only calling for the return of the hostages but want to underscore \"Israel's right to remain free from violence and the right of Jewish communities in North America and around the world to live free from hate.\" \"There's no place for such an ancient form of hate,\" said Gil Preuss, the CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, a chapter of the Jewish Federations of North America. Preuss said the Hamas attack on Israel should be an opportunity for peace-seeking Israelis and Palestinians to seek the eradication of the militant group. \"I firmly believe that Israelis and Palestinians need to be able to live in freedom and security, and it is the goal that both populations would like to have,\" Preuss said. \"The question is how do we get there?\" Ben-Yehuda, who considers herself a \u201cliberal Jew,\u201d said she, too, has empathy for Palestinians in Gaza and remains critical of Netanyahu\u2019s policies and failures for not working toward a two-state solution. \u201cI believe in the state of Israel, but the government is different,\u201d Ben-Yehuda said. \u201cIsrael has to continue, but she has to be for justice.\u201d Busloads of pro-Israel supporters began arriving at the Stadium-Armory in Washington well before the march got underway. Several were chartered by New York City\u2019s Temple Emanu-El for D.C. More buses carrying an estimated 1,250 people from the Jewish Federation of Cleveland arrived at the Kennedy Center. And a group from Hebrew Academy Miami posed with the Israeli flag before heading to the rally. But many were greeted by sometimes profane anti-Israel graffiti sprayed in red paint on sidewalks and garbage dispensers. \"It's sickening to know that's what people are doing,\" said Simon Taylor, a representative from the Orthodox Union. Ruthie Hollander, who is also a member of the Orthodox Union and had her 14-month-old daughter in tow as she greeted the buses, said in her community \"every single person is one degree of separation from someone in Israel.\" \u201cAnd so wherever politically many fall out, on a personal level, this is such a tragedy and so difficult,\" Hollander said. \"Many of us are really struggling even to just go day to day and there\u2019s a lot of fear, especially in New York City. Hate crimes have risen significantly.\u201d Sandra Nudelman, who lives in New Jersey and was at the rally with her sister, said that she is horrified that so many people have already died in Gaza but that the Israel Defense Forces is not deliberately targeting civilians the way Hamas did on Oct. 7. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing the best they can in a war that is not of their own making,\" Nudelman said. \"Civilian casualties are never something anyone wants to see. When I see pictures of Palestinians who are dying, I feel terrible for them.\" There were no immediate reports of arrests or counterdemonstrations. But concerned about possible outbreaks of violence between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian supporters, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser took steps early on to make sure her police force and the National Guard were ready. The Department of Homeland Security raised the security level to the highest designation in anticipation of an enormous crowd and because members of Congress were expected to attend, two DHS officials told NBC News. Ahead of the rally, at least one pro-Palestinian group, the Washington chapter of the Palestinian Youth Movement, asked its supporters on Instagram \u201cnot to engage\u201d with participants at Tuesday\u2019s pro-Israel event. Speaking via video, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said, \"Jews all over the world are assaulted for being Jewish.\" \"The hatred, the lies, the brutality, the disgraceful outburst of ancient antisemitism are an embarrassment to all civilized people and nations,\u201d Herzog told the crowd. \u201cJews in America must be safe. Jews all over the world must be safe.\u201d While Herzog spoke, vendors were selling T-shirts and buttons emblazoned with the names and photos of the Hamas hostages. Herzog was followed by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who took the stage to denounce Hamas and demand the release of the hostages. \"Let them go,\" Schumer chanted with the crowd. Schumer was joined onstage by recently elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who said now is not the time for a cease-fire. \"The calls for a cease-fire are outrageous,\" Johnson said. \"We stand with you on that.\" Schumer and Johnson were followed by \u201cWill & Grace\u201d star Debra Messing, who introduced some of the relatives of the hostages being held by Hamas. She asked people in the crowd to hold up placards with pictures of those kidnapped and appeared to take a swipe at those who see Hamas as Palestinian freedom fighters. \u201cWe are all being tested,\u201d Messing said. \u201cA tsunami of hate has crashed down upon us, and then a deafening silence. We see clearly now. We see naked, virulent Jew hatred being disguised as a noble cause for liberation. And we reject it.\u201d Netanyahu suggested Sunday there might be a possible deal to release the hostages. While the event was billed as a \"march,\" the tens of thousands of people organizers had planned for stayed largely within the confines of the National Mall rather than spill out into the streets. On Sunday, a march against antisemitism through the streets of Paris attracted about 100,000 people and was supported by representatives of the major political parties. Since the fighting began on Oct. 7, pro-Palestinian organizations have held their own rallies in cities across the U.S. and globally. Demonstrations have also roiled college campuses as schools struggle to contain escalating rhetoric and threats of violence. They include an Arab Muslim student at Stanford University who was struck in a hit-and-run that authorities are investigating as a hate crime and the arrest last month of a Cornell University junior accused of making online threats to Jewish students. The Anti-Defamation League said Monday that in the month since the war between Israel and Hamas began, it has documented 832 antisemitic incidents of assault, vandalism and harassment across the U.S. This is a 316% increase from the same period last year. \"As we have seen repeatedly, when conflict arises in the Middle East, particularly when Israel exercises its right to self-defense, antisemitic incidents increase here in the U.S. and around the world,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, the league's CEO, said in a statement. The Council on American-Islamic Relations also said it has seen a sharp rise in bias incidents since Oct. 7. Since then, the group said, it has received 1,283 \"requests for help and reports of bias,\" a 216% increase from an average period last year. Corey Saylor, the council's research and advocacy director, said it was the largest wave of Islamophobic bias the group has documented since the Trump administration implemented an immigration ban. \"Both Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism are out of control in ways we have not seen in almost 10 years,\" Saylor said in a statement.

        "title": "Trump allies in the House call for criminal probe of Michael Cohen after his testimony in fraud trial",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Michael Cohen, after Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer told a New York court that he had lied about his handling of the former president's business dealings in sworn testimony to Congress.  \u201cThat Mr. Cohen was willing to openly and brazenly state at trial that he lied to Congress on this specific issue is startling,\u201d Stefanik, of New York, and Turner, of Ohio, both Republicans, wrote in a letter to Garland obtained first by NBC News. \u201cHis willingness to make such a statement alone should necessitate an investigation.\u201d  Appearing as a key witness in Trump\u2019s New York civil fraud case last month, Cohen said he made false claims under oath when he told the House Intelligence Committee that neither Trump nor Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, asked him to inflate the numbers on Trump\u2019s personal financial statement. Cohen was questioned by an attorney for Trump over his deposition on Feb. 28, 2019, and asked whether he was \u201cbeing honest in front of the Permanent Select Committee.\u201d Cohen said he had not been and conceded that he had lied. After working for Trump for years, Cohen turned on Trump in 2018 and later testified against him before Congress. Trump\u2019s defense in the New York case has questioned Cohen\u2019s credibility repeatedly. Stefanik, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has urged the same. \u201cThe Biden Justice Department must take off its partisan blinders and investigate disgraced fraudster and disbarred attorney Michael Cohen, a felon previously convicted for lying to Congress, who just admitted to lying again to Congress,\u201d she said in a statement to NBC News. In a statement, Cohen rejected Stefanik and Turner\u2019s perjury claim and accused the lawmakers of working on behalf of the former president to muddy the waters in his legal case.  \u201cRepublican Congress members Stefanik and Turner continue to do Donald\u2019s bidding in witness tampering and obstructing justice,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe two members fail to understand the distinction between explicit and implied; which is how the question was asked and accurately responded to. The topic was further clarified several questions thereafter; which is conveniently and intentionally being ignored.\u201d Cohen added, \u201cI am not concerned at all with their baseless request.\u201d Further, Cohen warned, \u201cThis is the type of harassment everyone, especially critics, should expect if Donald becomes President again! The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. The criminal referral against Cohen comes just days after Stefanik, a top Trump ally, filed a judicial ethics complaint against the judge presiding over the case. Trump is accused of purposely overstating the value of his family\u2019s real estate assets in a suit that threatens the former president\u2019s control of his business. In 2018, Cohen, Trump\u2019s one-time personal attorney, pleaded guilty in federal court to lying to Congress about his work on a Trump-branded real estate project in Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. His testimony last month came amid a dramatic showdown that saw Trump storm out of the courtroom after the judge presiding over the case fined him $10,000 for violating a gag order. The former president returned to court later that day.   Trump, the Republican front-runner in the polls in the 2024 presidential race, has stoked controversy over suggestions that if returned to office, he could use the federal government to pursue his opponents as he believes the government has been weaponized against him.  In an interview last week with the Spanish-language channel Univision, Trump said that \u201cif they do this, and they\u2019ve already done it, but if they follow through on this, yeah, it could certainly happen in reverse.\u201d Katherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Fulton County DA asks for protective order after leak of witness videos in Trump election interference case",
        "content": "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office is seeking an emergency protective order after parts of videos from key witnesses in her election interference case against former President Donald Trump and others were leaked to two news outlets. \"The release of these confidential video recordings is clearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case, subjecting them to harassment and threats prior to trial,\" the DA's office said in a court filing Tuesday after parts of the videotaped statements of lawyers Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro and bail bondsman Scott Hall were made public. The four were among the original 19 defendants charged in the racketeering case in August and have all pleaded guilty to related charges. The footage, known as proffer videos, was made pursuant to the defendants\u2019 plea agreements, which required that they provide true and accurate information to prosecutors. Judge Scott McAfee scheduled a hearing on the emergency motion for Wednesday. Speaking Tuesday at the Washington Post Global Women\u2019s Summit, Willis called the leaks \u201cdisappointing\u201d but not \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cI am not happy that it was released,\" she said, adding that it was \"absolutely not my office\" that leaked the videos. The Ellis and Powell statements were first reported by ABC News, while the Chesebro and Hall statements were first reported by The Washington Post. The recordings, which have not been independently obtained by NBC News, shed new light on the scope of what they told prosecutors. Chesebro told them about a previously unreported White House meeting where he said he briefed then-President Trump on election challenges in Arizona and they discussed the \"alternate electors\" scheme. Powell testified that Trump was repeatedly told by others that he'd lost the election, which is the main reason he repeatedly conferred with her, because she thought he had won. \u201cDid I know anything about election law? No,\u201d Powell told prosecutors, according to ABC News. \u201cBut I understand fraud from having been a prosecutor for 10 years, and knew generally what the fraud suit should be if the evidence showed what I thought it showed.\u201d Ellis recounted Trump senior adviser Dan Scavino telling her in December that Trump didn\u2019t care about the election results, with Scavino adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave\u201d the White House. Trump's lawyer Steve Sadow brushed off the recordings in a statement to NBC News. \u201cAny purported private conversation is absolutely meaningless. The only salient and telling fact is that President Trump left the White House on January 20, 2021 and returned to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. If this is the nonsense line of inquiry being pursued and this is the type of bogus, ridiculous 'evidence' DA Willis intends to rely upon, it is one more reason that this political, travesty of a case must be dismissed,\u201d Sadow said. Hall, who was the first to plead guilty in the case, disclosed information about his involvement in an alleged scheme to pressure election worker Ruby Freeman to make false statements. In its filing Tuesday, the DA's office said an attorney for Harrison Floyd, another person charged in the Freeman scheme, initially copped to being the person responsible for the leak. After another defense attorney had asked prosecutors whether they were responsible for the leak in a group email, Floyd's attorney responded, \u201cIt was Harrison Floyd\u2019s team.\u201d The lawyer then sent a follow-up saying that was a \"typo.\" Floyd's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chesebro attorney Scott Grubman said he did not know the source of the videos. Lawyers for Ellis and Powell declined to comment, while Hall\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond. The DA's office noted that it asked for a protective order in September barring public disclosure of the information it was turning over to the defendant. The judge has yet to sign off on it, but the DA's office suggested the leaker could still face legal ramifications for violating that order. The leak \"constitutes indirect communication about the facts of this case with codefendants and witnesses, and obstructs the administration of justice, in violation of the conditions of release imposed on each defendant,\u201d the DA\u2019s office said. The office said in the filing that going forward it \"will not produce copies of confidential video recordings of proffers to any defendant to prevent further public disclosure. Instead, defendants must come to the District Attorney\u2019s Office to view confidential video recordings of proffers. They may take notes, but they will be prohibited from creating any recordings or reproductions.\" Blayne Alexander is an NBC News correspondent, based in Atlanta.

        "content": "More than 400 employees of President Joe Biden's administration have signed an open letter demanding he pursue a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war that has killed thousands of civilians thus far. \u201cWe represent a coalition of Biden-Harris Administration political appointees and civil servants, positioned across the domestic and foreign policy spheres, working in federal agencies, departments, independent agencies, and the White House,\u201d the letter, released Tuesday, begins. \u201cWe call on President Biden to urgently demand a ceasefire; and to call for de-escalation of the current conflict by securing the immediate release of the Israeli hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians; the restoration of water, fuel, electricity and other basic services; and the passage of adequate humanitarian aid to the Gaza strip,\u201d it continued. The letter says the signatories represent various backgrounds and faiths and work in more than 30 departments and agencies. Two administration staff members who led outreach efforts for the letter told NBC News that since the letter was first circulated about two weeks ago, it has gained the signatures of senior and low-level administration employees working across the federal government and in multiple countries. They include staff in the departments of Commerce, Defense, Interior, Homeland Security and the Executive Office of the President, among other agencies. The two staff members, who are political appointees, asked to remain anonymous out of concern about retaliation for speaking out against the administration\u2019s position. They said those who signed the letter also remained anonymous out of concern for their job security and personal safety. The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. The letter is the latest addition to growing calls on the Biden administration to demand a cease-fire and reassess its handling of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas. Every day, you\u2019re going in to work for this administration, then you\u2019re going to look at your phone, you\u2019re going to see the suffering that you kind of feel like you\u2019re causing \u2026 a lot of people are no longer comfortable being silent, no longer comfortable being complacent in a way.\u201d Since the war began after Hamas' brutal attack on Israel on Oct. 7, several efforts have launched from within the government to push for the de-escalation of the conflict, including letters from hundreds of Biden's former 2020 campaign staff and Muslim and Jewish congressional employees. The congressional staff urged Congress to support a cease-fire in light of \u201cantisemitism, anti-Muslim, and anti-Palestinian sentiment on the rise nationwide.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re at this point,\" one of the Biden administration staff members told NBC News. \"Having hundreds and thousands of people come together within this administration and within Congress and say we are calling for a cease-fire, something that\u2019s so basic to just end human suffering.\u201d The two are among what they said are many signatories with family and friends in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. \u201cOur loved ones are in imminent danger and every single day, waking up and not knowing what\u2019s going to happen is absolute hell,\u201d one staffer told NBC News. The dissonance \"of going to work every day and feeling like you are a part of something that is actively harming people you love was expressed by so many people involved in this.\u201d The staffers told NBC that based on what they\u2019ve experienced personally and heard from colleagues in the White House and across several government agencies, they believe there is a lack of direction of how staffers are supposed to talk about Israel\u2019s war with Hamas. \u201cSome agencies have had specific meetings about this \u2026 and in some places it has been completely taboo to even talk about this,\u201d one said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it expressed among staffers of all levels that they feel a lack of guidance for how to talk about this, how to manage people suffering because of this.\" \"A lot of people feel quite alone and frustrated,\u201d the staffer added. Both described a disconnect between what is coming out of the senior levels of the administration and what they and their colleagues are feeling.  \u201cA lot of us are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president, a lot of us came from his campaign,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cSo there\u2019s this uneasy feeling of not agreeing with what we\u2019re working on.\u201d More than 50 employees of the Democratic National Committee, which handles much of Biden\u2019s campaign fundraising efforts, anonymously signed an open letter this month urging their leadership to demand that Biden seek a cease-fire as the war between Israel and Hamas rages on. Amid internal and external criticism over Biden\u2019s response to the war, the administration has ramped up outreach to Arab, Palestinian and Muslim Americans in hopes of explaining its approach to the conflict, as some aides worried Biden hadn\u2019t shown enough empathy for Palestinian civilians and a Muslim community facing anger at home.  \u201cEfforts to rebuild communities before calling for a ceasefire are going to fall on deaf ears because until that\u2019s being called, nothing will be seen as genuine. There\u2019s no way to escape this conversation,\u201d one of the administration staff members who led their letter\u2019s outreach efforts told NBC. \u201cEvery day, you\u2019re going in to work for this administration, then you\u2019re going to look at your phone, you\u2019re going to see the suffering that you kind of feel like you\u2019re causing \u2026 a lot of people are no longer comfortable being silent, no longer comfortable being complacent in a way.\u201d The Biden administration staffer told NBC News that they and some administration colleagues they\u2019ve spoken with have considered resigning because of the administration\u2019s handling of the war up to this point. A veteran State Department official, Josh Paul, resigned last month, citing what he called the U.S.\u2019 \u201cblind support\u201d for Israel in its war with Hamas and its continued \u201cprovision of lethal arms to Israel.\u201d \u201cThese are people who really want to serve the public, including people who want to serve the president,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to push people to a breaking point if this continues.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of damage done within the public service community, and I\u2019m not sure how we are going to repair that,\u201d the second staffer said. \u201cThe U.S. government has an immense amount of power to change the status quo on the ground and the refusal to acknowledge that feels like a betrayal.\u201d Both told NBC News they would be watching to see whether Biden acknowledges the March for Israel, a pro-Israel rally expected to draw tens of thousands of people to Washington on Tuesday.  On Nov. 4, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched from Washington\u2019s Freedom Plaza to the White House calling for a cease-fire and an end to the siege on Gaza. Biden was at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home the weekend of the march. \u201cThere is growing dissent across his administration, from people close to him,\u201d one of the administration staffers said. \u201cThis is his own alum from the campaign, from within his own administration. \u2026 A complete disregard for that would send a really clear and unwelcoming message.\u201d Allie Raffa is an NBC News White House correspondent based in Washington, D.C.

        "title": "How a government shutdown could upend holiday travel",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers across the country could be working without pay during the Thanksgiving travel rush as the U.S. heads toward a government shutdown days before a record number of air passengers are expected at U.S. airports. The federal government will shut down and be unable to continue paying its workers starting Saturday unless Congress passes a new funding bill. While airport security and air traffic controllers will still be required to show up for work without pay, past shutdowns have led to increases in absenteeism, which could be a recipe for flight delays and extreme security lines for holiday travelers.  The air travel workforce is already stretched thin, with TSA officers and air traffic controllers working mandatory overtime amid staffing shortages and a record number of air travelers. The financial uncertainty of not being paid could put even more strain on the system, making it difficult for some to afford the child care and transportation needed to get to work, while others could be forced to take on second jobs.  \u201cIf we\u2019re going to shut down, it\u2019s going to be ugly. I\u2019m very concerned about the mental state of the employees and how long they\u2019re willing to endure this government shutdown,\u201d said an official with the union representing TSA employees, Johnny Jones, a transportation security officer at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that they\u2019re thinking about is that next paycheck.\u201d Follow live updates on the government shutdown bill vote The TSA expects an increase in travelers over the Thanksgiving holiday period, with the busiest day being the Sunday after Thanksgiving, when a record 3 million people are expected to fly. House Republicans will try again to pass a short-term budget this week, but with just five legislative days left until the deadline, there is little room for error. Over the weekend, House Republicans put forth an unusual approach to averting a shutdown by proposing several spending bills needed to keep the government open into January to bring together opposing Republican factions.  During the last shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, 2018, travelers faced longer security screening lines after TSA officer call-outs increased as much as threefold at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and the absentee rate among airport screeners peaked at 10%, compared to the average 3% absence rate, according to a report by the research firm Tourism Economics. Biden administration officials have begun warning about the toll a shutdown could have on employees and the ripple effect it could have on travelers. \u201cThe last government shutdown in 2019 was 35 days, and when you go 35 days without a source of income, that\u2019s very, very hard,\u201d TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \"TODAY\" show. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put gas in your car. It\u2019s hard to pay for parking, hard to pay for child care. So the longer a shutdown goes, the bigger the impact on us.\u201d  During the last shutdown, airports across the Northeast experienced major delays after an increased number of air traffic controllers called out sick. Hours after the air travel disruptions, the White House announced a deal to reopen the government.  This time, the impact on air travel could be felt much sooner and more acutely given how thinly stretched the air travel workforce already is, said Joe McCartin, the executive director of the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University, who has studied past air travel labor disputes.  \u201cThe understaffing at air traffic control facilities is significantly worse now than it was in 2019, so you already have air traffic controllers who are working under more pressure. A lot of them are working mandatory six-day weeks,\u201d McCartin said. \u201cThey are already under stress, so if you were to add to that anything like what happened in 2019, where you have an extended shutdown where people are not being paid, and if that also coincides with the holiday season, I think it\u2019s a very tenuous situation.\u201d Federal Aviation Administration and TSA employees are prohibited from going on strike or organizing sickouts under federal law, but McCartin said nothing prevents individual employees from calling out sick.  Rail travel could also feel the effects of a shutdown. Amtrak employees will continue to be paid, but during past shutdowns, some Federal Railroad Administration personnel have been furloughed and employees with the Office of Railroad Safety worked without pay. If the government shuts down, federal workers will receive the paychecks they are scheduled to receive through Saturday, an administration official said. After that, workers wouldn\u2019t receive any additional pay until Congress passes a budget. In past shutdowns, Congress has appropriated back pay to reimburse federal employees for the period where they weren\u2019t paid.   TSA workers and union leaders held a rally outside Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Friday calling on Congress to act and prevent a shutdown.  \u201cThis is the busiest airport in the world, and the [transportation security officers] here work around the clock to make sure that all of these travelers reach their destination safely,\u201d Tatishka Thomas, a union leader with the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSA agents, said during the rally. \u201cThe fact that certain members of Congress are willing to play chicken with the pay of these unsung heroes is unconscionable.\u201d Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News digital.

        "title": "For historically conservative Jewish Americans, Biden's response to Israel receives praise",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden pointed to the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists chanted \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d as an impetus for declaring a presidential run in 2020. He has spoken about taking his grandchildren to see Dachau, an infamous concentration camp where tens of thousands of Jews drew their last breaths. In May, the Biden administration released a national strategy to counter antisemitism following a spike in reported antisemitic incidents last year. American Jews have taken note, according to several leaders who say they have observed a shift, particularly among groups that did not previously support Biden. Follow live updates here After Hamas' attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, many American Jews are rallying around Biden's handling of the war, referring to his response as a show of \"moral clarity.\" Thousands are expected to descend upon Washington on Tuesday to push for continued assistance to Israel. Biden \"feels it in his kishkes,\" said Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, using a Yiddish word that can translate to \"gut.\" \"He feels the connection to our community.\" She added, \"He's a man of clear moral clarity.\" Sarah Hurwitz, a White House speechwriter for the Obama administration, said in an email, \"To have a president who is so steady, with such a strong moral core, and such deep wisdom and experience \u2014 it\u2019s really heartening right now.\" American Jews overwhelmingly align themselves with Democrats. Before the 2020 election, a Pew Research Center survey found that 71% of Jews surveyed consider themselves Democrats or lean Democratic. But amid the war, Biden is also attracting praise from more religious Jews, a constituency that often identifies as Republican. Ariella Gordon, 28, an Orthodox Jew living in Maryland, said it was \"pleasantly shocking\" to see Biden's strength in his \"moral clarity.\" \"It's becoming increasingly apparent as a Jew in America that our friends really are few and far between,\" said Gordon, who identifies as politically conservative. \"I would consider Biden to be a friend of Israel and Jews in America,\" she said when she was asked whether Biden is among those friends. The shifting support for Biden among Orthodox Jews may not translate to additional votes in 2024. Only about 2.4% of U.S. adults are Jewish, according to a Pew report released in 2021, and just a small fraction of American Jews are Orthodox. On the other side, Biden has faced increasing criticism from pro-Palestinian factions of the Democratic Party, including some Arab American leaders who are threatening to withhold support for his re-election bid in critical swing states like Michigan and Minnesota. The lack of political impact from swinging Jewish voters has largely meant less attention has been paid since the war broke out. \u201cI can tell you, at least anecdotally, that many, many people in the community who certainly voted for Trump are, are very grateful and appreciative of how President Biden has been supporting Israel in this battle against Hamas,\u201d said Nathan Diament, a leader of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. Diament declined to share how he voted in 2020. Naomi Grant, 26, a Modern Orthodox Jew living in Washington, D.C., said: \u201cBiden has really not stood by Israel as much as I would have hoped since he has been elected, but at least he, he is now. So I do appreciate that his administration is improving.\u201d Grant, who considers herself politically moderate, voted for Biden in 2020 but does not plan to support him in 2024 because of his policies toward Iran and his age \u2014 Biden will be 81 years old this month. She said she \"definitely wouldn't vote for Trump,\" either. But for some, Biden's age is a testament to his long record on Israel. He was born a handful of years before the establishment of the Israeli state. In speeches over the years, he has frequently recalled former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir's telling him Israel's secret weapon: \"We have no place else to go.\" \"This is actually a positive aspect of his age,\" said Soifer, who was a senior policy adviser to Samantha Power when she was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration. \"No one has a longer record on this issue than Joe Biden. He's been working on this issue since he was elected to the Senate in 1972.\" In the aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Biden condemned the \"pure, unadulterated evil\" that took place Oct. 7, emphasizing again and again that the U.S. stands with Israel. Just days after the attacks, he embarked on a whirlwind trip to Israel. He also spoke to a roundtable of Jewish community leaders. Several members of the roundtable told NBC News that they have since met with leaders from the Education Department, the Justice Department and the FBI. \"I think they've been incredibly receptive and responsive,\" said Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, who has attended meetings with administration officials. \"I think it's deeply personal for so, so many of them on various levels.\" The meetings come at a personal time for many American Jews, who face a spike in antisemitic incidents after Oct. 7. The Anti-Defamation League's preliminary data recorded a 388% increase in harassment, vandalism and assault in the weeks after the attacks, compared to the same period last year. \"I can't recall a scarier time to be Jewish in America,\" said Sheila Katz, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, who has met with administration officials about their response to the war and antisemitism following Oct. 7. Jews' security concerns amid rising antisemitism \"became even more intense after Tree of Life in Pittsburgh five years ago,\" said Eric Lesser, a former Obama aide who is Jewish, referring to the 2018 attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 people dead. \"And now it feels many orders of magnitude beyond that. And I think the community has really been comforted by how President Biden has spoken about the conflict.\" The administration, however, still faces staunch criticism from a faction of Jews who are rallying for a cease-fire. Hundreds of American Jews and allies demonstrated on the National Mall and in a congressional office building last month to call on Biden to join their demand for a cease-fire. \"We can\u2019t stay silent as long as the Israeli military is committing atrocities in our name,\" reads a website page for Jewish Voice for Peace, a self-described progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization that says it has upward of 700,000 members and supporters. Shoshana, 29, a Modern Orthodox Jew living in Seattle, said she was upset that the Biden administration was not calling for a cease-fire. She asked that her last name not be used because she feared blowback from community members. \"I think it is our duty as Jews, as people who have been so incredibly oppressed for centuries, that we stand up for people who are in pain and for people who are suffering, that we shouldn't be turning around and doing the same things that have been done to us for centuries,\" said Shoshana, who identifies as a progressive Democrat. In the weeks after the start of the war, the Biden administration ramped up outreach to Muslim and Arab Americans as some White House aides worried that Biden had not shown enough care for those communities as the death toll of Palestinian civilians climbed. In a statement, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates, while also emphasizing Biden\u2019s support for Israel and work against antisemitism, pointed to Biden's work to \"prioritize the needs of the Palestinian people \u2014 the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas \u2014 by securing humanitarian aid, working to alleviate suffering in Gaza, and urging Israel to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties as they root out Hamas.\" \"Fighting against the poison of hate, including antisemitism, and standing up for Israel\u2019s sovereign right to defend itself have always been core values for President Biden,\" the top of his statement read. \"And they always will be.\" Megan Lebowitz is based in the Washington bureau.

        "title": "'No detail too small': How the U.S. and China planned President Xi's visit",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A presidential meeting at an undisclosed location. Students lining the streets waving Chinese flags. A $2,000-per-plate dinner with the most powerful business executives in America. Every aspect of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to California this week has been highly choreographed, down to what he sees outside the window during a motorcade ride and what camera angle he\u2019s recorded from, according to people familiar with the planning.  \u201cThere is no detail too small,\u201d said Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific. Any meeting between two heads of state involves a degree of pomp and circumstance, but President Joe Biden\u2019s long-awaited sit-down with Xi on Wednesday is the product of a painstaking process to accommodate China\u2019s many requests. The behind-the-scenes effort is a sign of Beijing\u2019s anxiety over the optics that could result from Xi\u2019s first visit to the U.S. in six years. Overall, China is looking for Xi\u2019s trip to California to be seen as a \u201cgrand visit,\u201d officials said. The White House isn\u2019t even sharing the precise location of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, with officials publicly citing \u201coperational security\u201d concerns but privately conceding the Chinese didn\u2019t want it disclosed to try to minimize protests. To try to visually overwhelm any protests, Chinese officials are expected to bring in students from across California to wave Chinese flags and show support for Xi. The move is meant to ensure Xi has a \u201cpleasant visual\u201d as he moves from event to event, a former official familiar with the planning said. \u201cThose will be the pictures that will be beamed back home,\u201d said Victor Cha, a former National Security Council director for Asian affairs. \u201cNothing can go wrong. It has to be 100% perfect,\u201d Cha said, adding that the goal for the Chinese is that Xi be \u201ctreated like an emperor, and anything short of that or embarrassing is really the absolute worst thing that can happen for them.\u201d The U.S. also has cleaned up San Francisco, including clearing out encampments of people experiencing homelessness and sprucing up the streets. Chinese officials have privately expressed concern to their U.S. counterparts about what Xi will experience during his travel, according to people familiar with the discussions. They insisted that the meeting be held before a broader gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders in San Francisco this week and at a location entirely separate from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit site, two current and former U.S. officials said. China\u2019s request was designed to elevate Xi\u2019s stature above that of the other world leaders traveling to California this week, the officials said. Another event where Xi will optically stand a cut above his counterparts is scheduled to take place Wednesday evening. After he meets with Biden, Xi is scheduled to headline a $2,000-a-plate dinner with top U.S. CEOs and other dignitaries, officials said. They said that Biden isn\u2019t expected be there because he\u2019ll be hosting a separate dinner but that some high-level administration officials might attend.  Xi plans to deliver a major address at the dinner, which is being organized by American think tanks, including the Asia Society and the U.S. China Business Council, officials said. The evening also will include a private VIP reception beforehand for key executives, they said. The Chinese are keenly focused on courting the business community, as U.S. investment in China has been sliding in recent years, a huge priority area for Xi during the California visit. The CEOs dinner is also meant as a signal to Washington, according to experts, about the strong ties the Chinese government has with some influential business leaders, as the Chinese economy struggles to recover post-pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for those business leaders to listen to Chinese senior officials about what\u2019s happening [with China\u2019s economy] and to solve the doubts they have in mind,\u201d said Mike Liu, a vice president and senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization. Xi last visited the U.S. in 2017, when he went to Florida to meet with President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.  Xi last spoke with Biden a year ago this week at a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations. Relations soured three months later after the Biden administration shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had flown over the U.S. and Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a trip to Beijing. Biden administration officials have spent the months since then trying to reduce tensions with China, with the goal of getting a meeting between the two leaders on the calendar. In that sense, the U.S. also has incentive to make sure Xi feels his visit was a success, and it has worked to accommodate China\u2019s requests.  One of China\u2019s requests was the timing of formally announcing Wednesday\u2019s meeting, an administration official said. China wanted to delay an announcement until Monday, just two days before the meeting, another U.S. official said. The White House compromised and agreed to announce it Friday, though officials wanted to make it public earlier, the official said. The accommodating approach is a contrast to how China has handled some U.S. presidents\u2019 visits to China. In 2016, for instance, President Barack Obama exited Air Force One from a small staircase in the belly of the plane after a lengthy debate on the ground between U.S. and Chinese officials over using a larger staircase that is typically rolled out for a red-carpet tarmac greeting.   Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, said that for this trip by Xi, administration officials have been involved in discussions with the Chinese about \u201cevery possible aspect of the visit,\u201d from camera angles to seating arrangements. \u201cI think both sides want a high degree of predictability when our two leaders really sit down opposite each other,\u201d he said. An unpredictable dynamic for Biden that could sour the optics for his goal of presenting the U.S. as economically strong and an example of a thriving democracy: a potential government shutdown. The federal government is set to run out of funding Friday, the last scheduled day of the Asia-Pacific summit. If there is no agreement on Capitol Hill before then, it\u2019s possible Biden would return to Washington early, officials said, and his engagements in San Francisco would be cut short. On Monday, White House officials suggested a shutdown could be avoided, as well as a scenario that would be less than ideal for U.S. officials who hope a domestic crisis doesn\u2019t overshadow an important global moment hosted by the president.

        "title": "Biden administration bolsters effort to battle antisemitism and Islamophobia in schools",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration is rolling out new tools Tuesday to address the continued rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses nationwide following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war last month, according to a White House official. Among the materials are a list of resources from the Education Department for students, parents and staff members aimed at preventing antisemitism and Islamophobia in all school levels, from elementary to college. The two guides, one meant for young students and one for higher education institutions, were put together by the National Center for Safe and Supportive Learning Environments, a technical assistance center funded by the Education Department, the White House said.  The new tools build on actions the White House has announced in recent weeks, including creating a national strategy to combat Islamophobia that tasks the departments of Justice and Homeland Security with thwarting growing threats of antisemitism on college campuses in conjunction with campus law enforcement after Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 killed 1,200 people. As part of the effort, dozens of cybersecurity and protective security advisers at DHS have been detailed to work with schools as they navigate increasingly tense environments.  President Joe Biden has been under pressure to respond to mounting incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses. On Friday, Columbia University suspended two student groups critical of Israel, accusing them of violating school policy with threatening rhetoric and intimidation. Cornell University canceled classes for a day this month after violent antisemitic threats led to the arrest of a student. Last month, the FBI said it was investigating death threats against a Palestinian staff member of American University in Washington, D.C. Senior Education Department leaders will also host listening sessions with educators from preschool to university levels to learn more about how schools have been trying to keep students safe since the war started, the official said.  There will also be more listening sessions in the coming weeks, organized by the Education Department, with Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian and Sikh students, educators and staff members.  The Justice Department also published an updated \u201chate crimes threat response guide\u201d from the FBI to let people know what steps they should take if they are the subject of one, the official said. It has also been shared with key organizations tracking such threats, as well as state and local law enforcement agencies.   \u201cThese actions will help protect students, engage school and university leaders, and foster safe and supportive learning environments,\u201d the official said.  The new guide helps people figure out how to respond to potential hate crimes, depending on what form the attacks come in. The Education Department will also launch a webinar series about hate-based threats, bullying and harassment next month. The Agriculture Department will host webinars specifically about how such incidents have taken place on rural college campuses. Antisemitic incidents in the U.S. climbed 388% in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks last month, compared to the same period last year, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a group focused on fighting antisemitism and extremism. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said last month that requests for help and reports of bias from Muslims also spiked across the U.S. from Oct. 7 to Oct. 24, compared to any 16-day stretch last year.  More than 11,000 people, including women and children, have died in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, and more than 1.6 million have been displaced. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand by and stand silent,\u201d Biden said Oct. 20 in an Oval Office address. \u201cWe must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.\u201d  Monica Alba is a White House correspondent for NBC News. Zo\u00eb Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Ex-Fox News reporter sues network, saying he was fired for challenging lies about 2020 election",
        "content": "A former Fox News Capitol Hill reporter and producer has sued the network, claiming he was fired for challenging its on-air lies about the 2020 election. Jason Donner alleges in the lawsuit that Fox News knew President Donald Trump's claims that voter fraud was behind his 2020 loss were false but that following backlash from Trump and the network's audience over its Election Day announcement that President Joe Biden had won Arizona, it \"purged\" journalists who spoke out against false election fraud claims. \"To win back viewership and pledge its loyalty to President Trump, Fox\u2019s corporate leadership purged the news division and those reporters who spoke out against claims of election fraud,\" says the suit, which was initially filed in Washington, D.C., Superior Court but has since moved to a federal court. The wrongful termination and discrimination claim seeks undisclosed damages and expenses, as well as a judgment that would prohibit Fox News from discriminating or retaliating against Donner or other current or former Fox News employees. Though it was filed Sept. 27, the lawsuit did not come to light until Monday in a report by the Daily Beast. \u201cMr. Donner\u2019s lawsuit speaks for itself, and we have no further comment beyond that,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s lawyer Brendan J. Klaproth said by email. Neither a Fox News spokesperson nor lawyers for the network responded to requests for comment. The suit claims the network \u201cimmediately capitulated to Trump\u201d after he denounced it. Post-election layoffs included the reporter who made the announcement on the air, Chris Stirewalt, and about 20 other journalists, the suit says. The filing cites text messages between Lachlan Murdoch, a co-chair of Fox News' parent company, News Corp., and the network's CEO, Suzanne Scott, in which Scott is quoted as saying the network's Arizona call \"was damaging but we will highlight our stars and plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them.\u201d A News Corp. spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry seeking comment from Murdoch or his representatives at the company. According to the suit, Donner was reprimanded and prohibited from expressing \"opinions\" when, on Nov. 19, 2020, he posted on Twitter (now known as X) that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed voter fraud in Philadelphia but told a Pennsylvania court, \"This is not a fraud case.\" Fox News became a \"toxic environment\" for journalists with allegiance to the truth, the suit says, and the toxicity reached a peak on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to thwart the counting of the electoral votes certifying Biden's victory. Donner was working in the Senate's Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery when the Capitol was breached, the claim says. As the Capitol began to be \"attacked,\" he said, he sought refuge inside the Fox News booth as the network reported that the rioters were \"peaceful,\" according to the suit. Later, as violence continued, including gunshots, a Fox News reporter said of rioters on the air, according to the claim, \"When you hear their voices, you can understand why they were severely disappointed.\" Donner called the Fox News control room, according to the filing, and said, \"I don\u2019t want to hear any of this f-----g s--- on our air ever again because you\u2019re gonna get us all killed.\" Despite increased scrutiny from Fox News executives, according to the suit, Donner was defiantly pro-fact, pushing back when executives directed reporters to cover stories based on pro-Trump opinion pieces published by newspapers and conservative websites, the filing says. When prime time host Tucker Carlson prepared to air a special, \"Patriot Purge,\" that claimed the Jan. 6 incursion was orchestrated by Trump opponents, Donner worked on a piece debunking the conspiracy theory and other false claims in the special, the suit says. \"Patriot Purge was released despite the fact that Fox News knew it contained false information,\" the suit says. By spring 2022, Donner was in the crosshairs of managers, including his new supervisor, who \"demanded\" that he and colleagues \"inaccurately report on the election and former President Trump.\" Donner went on medical leave shortly thereafter, according to the lawsuit. The filing further says that after he returned, he filed a written complaint to his supervisor and the network's human resources department, taking issue with coverage that included false claims about the Capitol insurrection, as well as criticisms that he was reporting on topics \"the network does not care about,\" such as Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation process. That resulted in an over two-hour-long Zoom meeting with HR in which Donner complained about the \"false reporting\" by Carlson, who has since left the network, and the \"toxic environment\" it bred there, the suit claims. A request for comment sent to the Facebook page of Carlson's new show was not immediately answered. The next month, Donner took a sick day as he recovered from the effects of the Covid vaccine, resulting in his supervisor's calling him the next day and yelling at him while questioning his work ethic, according to the lawsuit. He was fired the day after that, on Sept. 28, 2022, the suit says. The suit cites information included in Dominion Voting Systems' 2021 claim against Fox News, in which the voting machine maker said the broadcaster defamed it by airing claims that it was tied to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, paid kickbacks to politicians and deployed machines that rigged the vote count against Trump. Fox News settled that suit for $787.5 million. \"We acknowledge the Court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" the network said in a statement after the April settlement. Donner's political discrimination claims \u2014 he says he was a lifelong Republican but voted Democratic in recent elections \u2014 are based on the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, which prohibits workplace bias based on political affiliation.

        "title": "Trump rivals drop out and fade away, pitting Nikki Haley versus Ron DeSantis for second",
        "content": "On a private conference call Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged his presidential campaign's national finance committee to recruit donors from Sen. Tim Scott's newly defunct operation, according to a participant. Hours earlier, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced that she would spend $10 million on ads in Iowa and New Hampshire starting the first week of December. When other candidates are dropping out or fading away, the aggressive moves bolster the assertion of an increasing number of Republican strategists and operatives: that the GOP presidential primary campaign is coming down to a fight between Haley and DeSantis to pull into second behind former President Donald Trump. The field is already winnowing, long before the first votes are cast in Iowa\u2019s Jan. 15 caucuses. Former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his bid late last month, and Scott, R-S.C., abruptly followed suit Sunday after a lackluster showing in last week\u2019s NBC News-hosted GOP debate. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy are polling in the low to mid single digits, and two other candidates \u2014 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson \u2014 failed to qualify for the debate. Yet the consolidation of the field isn't a slam-dunk positive for the remaining Trump rivals. In Iowa, Scott's supporters divided relatively evenly among Trump, Haley and DeSantis when their second choices were polled in an NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey last month. Each of the three other candidates would get about a quarter of the 7% support Scott got in that survey. \u201cEveryone\u2019s wrestling for second place at this point, if these polls are to believed, which I think they are,\u201d said a Christie donor, who posited that only a criminal conviction of Trump could change the dynamics. \u201cShort of that, I don\u2019t see, honestly, how he loses the nomination.\u201d Within Christie's circle of donors, there's a growing sense of doom \u2014 and some suggestion that it's time for him to exit the stage. \"Those of us who are anyone-but-Trump are wondering why he doesn\u2019t get out of the race,\u201d said a second Christie contributor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s lower-level Lilliputian at this point. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that we\u2019re making any headway.\" Maria Comella, a senior adviser to Christie, said: \u201cIf we were determining the race at this moment based on current polling, then everyone should get out and just cede it to Trump. That\u2019s not how this works. We are still over two months away from the first votes\u2019 being cast, and this is a war of attrition. This will end up being a two-person race, and I\u2019d like to see the person standing there next to Trump actually be the one candidate able to take him on.\u201d Comella gently chided those who think they have a crystal ball. \u201cFor everyone today who seems to know exactly how this is going to play out, I\u2019d like to know where they were back in 2016, 2012 and 2008,\u201d she said. In a milestone first reported by NBC News, Christie's campaign said Monday that he has met the 80,000-donor threshold to qualify for the next Republican debate in December. But he hasn\u2019t yet met the polling criteria, according to an NBC News analysis. That would require him to hit the 6% mark in two national polls or in one national poll plus two polls from separate states. DeSantis, the beneficiary of tens of millions of dollars in spending by the super PAC Never Back Down, had some early stumbles in raising money. But DeSantis allies were pleased with his performance in last week\u2019s debate, and his campaign raised $1 million within 24 hours of the face-off with Haley, Ramaswamy, Christie and Scott. (Haley also raised $1 million in the first 24 hours.) After he launched a $2 million ad buy in Iowa earlier this year, DeSantis was in strong enough financial position to pour more cash into the buy. Still, some donors remain jittery over the cash flow. \"The burn rate was so high in the beginning he could be on fumes by Iowa,\u201d said a second DeSantis donor who wasn\u2019t on the Monday call. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these desperate cash calls.\u201d But the campaign pushed back against any notion that DeSantis was struggling with fundraising. \u201cAs much as the press loves to play the unnamed sources game, the reality is that our campaign\u2019s fundraising only continues to accelerate,\" DeSantis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said. \"We continue to see great results, such as raising over $1 million in 24 hours after the debate last week, and will have all the resources we need to grind out the battle for the nomination.\u201d The DeSantis donor, like many other Republicans have in recent weeks, described the contest as a two-person race to be in second to Trump. Haley, who has risen in national and state polls since the first Republican debate at the end of September, is still below 10% in most national surveys. But she was running even with DeSantis for second place in Iowa in the NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in October, and she also holds that spot in many public polls of New Hampshire and South Carolina. DeSantis has been in second place in national surveys, behind Trump, since before he entered the race in May. There doesn't appear to be much incentive for either DeSantis or Haley to leave the race when both of them have enough cash to keep running, polls show that they have distanced themselves from the rest of the pack, and voters haven't yet cast ballots. But even if one of them could consolidate non-Trump support, it's not clear that Trump could be defeated. Trump has been polling above the 50% threshold \u2014 at times cracking the 60% mark \u2014 in surveys for several months. His attacks appear to have weighed down DeSantis, who now polls worse against President Joe Biden in many hypothetical general election matchups than Trump does. A New York Times/Siena College poll this month found Haley beating Biden in a general election by greater margins in most battleground states than other Republicans, including Trump. That explains, at least in part, why Haley is getting a second look from donors to other candidates who have either dropped out or look like they are on their last legs. Bill Strong, a donor and member of Haley\u2019s campaign executive committee, said he thinks it will be a two-person race: between Haley and Trump. He pointed to polls showing Haley leading DeSantis in New Hampshire and South Carolina and being in a dead heat for second in Iowa. He also argued that Haley spent her money wisely, ramping up after a strong first debate performance in Milwaukee in September and waiting for December to launch a $10 million TV ad campaign in Iowa. \u201cGov. DeSantis will fight hard. Nikki will win,\u201d Strong said. \u201cThe focus I\u2019ve had is get it down to a point where it\u2019s Nikki versus President Trump, and then the voters can decide. I think when they see the contrast \u2014 given his age and her policy positions \u2014 she\u2019s going to be the nominee.\u201d But the NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey suggests that the lion's share of DeSantis voters in Iowa would go to Trump, not Haley, if DeSantis dropped out, while the plurality of Haley voters would go to DeSantis if she left the race. It has been part of the DeSantis team's pitch for support throughout the fall. Forty-one percent of DeSantis supporters in Iowa said Trump is their second choice, and only 27% said Haley, according to the poll. But 34% of Haley voters chose DeSantis as their second choice, with only 12% identifying Trump as their next pick.

        "title": "Paul Pelosi testifies about moments after hammer-wielding attacker burst into his room",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., recalled Monday being bludgeoned by a hammer-wielding assailant and waking up in a pool of his own blood. Paul Pelosi, 83, took the witness stand to testify against the man accused of attacking him with a hammer in a politically motivated attack on Oct. 28, 2022. \"The door opened, and a very large man came in with a hammer in one hand and some ties in the other, and he said, 'Where\u2019s Nancy?' as I think that woke me up,\" Pelosi testified.  \"I\u2019m asleep, and he bursts in the door, and that woke me up.\" Pelosi sustained a fractured skull. The suspect, David DePape, has pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. Pelosi testified he didn't set his home's alarm before he went to bed, so there was no warning sound when the attacker broke the glass of a rear door to enter. The assailant had a hammer and zip ties, and, Pelosi said, \"I recognized I was in serious danger.\" \"He was standing in the doorway, and I assume he was 3, 4 feet away from me,\" Pelosi testified. \"It was a tremendous sense of shock to see somebody broken into the house.\" When Pelosi told his attacker that his wife was in Washington, D.C., DePape allegedly said he'd have to tie him up and they'd wait for her return. Pelosi managed to get his cellphone and call 911 from the bathroom before DePape snatched the phone away, he testified. Pelosi said he knew his best chance to survive was to get downstairs to meet responding police, and he testified that he told DePape: \u201cSince all your stuff is downstairs, why don\u2019t we go downstairs? You can tie me up, and you can get some sleep.\u201d When officers arrived, Pelosi said, he reached for DePape's hand, with the hammer, before DePape pushed him away and started hitting him. Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Vartain asked Pelosi what he remembered next, and he said: \u201cWaking up in a pool of blood.\u201d Pelosi said he still has headaches and dizzy spells from the brutal attack. He quipped that he's pleased his hair has grown back in, saying it \"must be Italian roots or something.\" Pelosi completed his testimony with no cross-examination from DePape\u2019s defense lawyers, who don't contest that their client was the attacker. DePape appeared stoic as Pelosi testified. While Pelosi moved and spoke slowly, he appeared alert and generally recovered from last year's attack. Pelosi admitted that he has tried to keep the horrifying night out of his mind: \"I made the best effort I possibly can to not relive this.\"   Nancy Pelosi wasn't in court Monday. Although she has said she has no intention to seek the gavel again, Pelosi, 83, has already announced her 2024 run for the San Francisco seat she has held since 1987. Their daughter Christine Pelosi was in court Monday, as she has been since jury selection on Nov. 6. Closing arguments are scheduled for Wednesday, and the deliberations are expected to begin later in the day. Before Paul Pelosi took the stand Monday afternoon, prosecutors showed jurors police body camera video of the attack, in which he was struck three times. The disturbing video, played in slow motion, appeared to transfix jurors, though no one reacted audibly. DePape's defense previously sought to prevent the government from showing the attack in slow motion, but U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley allowed it. The federal trial in downtown San Francisco is sure to lay bare the corrosive impact of conspiracy theories and misinformation in modern politics. DePape was caught in a rabbit\u2019s hole of far-right conspiracies that led him to believe the nation is run by a \u201cruling class engaged in corruption,\u201d defense attorney Jodi Linker told jurors last week. DePape wasn\u2019t out to kidnap Nancy Pelosi or do harm to Paul Pelosi, the defense maintains; instead, it says, he sought to use them to reach a person the prosecution calls \u201cTarget 1.\u201d That person has been identified as Bay Area scholar and University of Michigan professor Gayle Rubin, a leading academic in feminist theory and queer studies. The government has said DePape planned for months to attack the Pelosi home and kidnap the House speaker. DePape allegedly had $9,000 cash, zip ties, rope and duct tape in a backpack that he took to the Pelosi home, according to the government. DePape has blogged about his belief that aliens, communists, religious minorities and global elites all threaten America, authorities have said. He has repeated baseless allegations that Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 was not legitimate and embraced QAnon, a far-right movement that claims America is being secretly run by a cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles, officials have said. DePape faces up to life in prison if he is convicted. Chris Young reported from San Francisco and David K. Li from New York City. Chris Young is a field producer for NBC News. David K.

        "title": "Democrats signal support for Speaker Johnson's plan to avert a government shutdown",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After having trashed the idea of a two-step strategy to fund the government, House Democrats signaled Monday they are open to backing Speaker Mike Johnson's plan, significantly lowering the threat of a painful shutdown at the end of the week. With a handful of conservatives rebelling against the stopgap funding bill, it means Johnson, R-La., must get help from Democrats to get it through the chamber. On Monday afternoon, House Democratic leaders said they are considering supporting the Johnson strategy. And across the Capitol, Johnson's plan got a bipartisan boost from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggesting the continuing resolution, or CR, is likely to cruise through the Senate if it can first pass out of the House. The House plans to take up the bill Tuesday. Follow live updates on the government shutdown bill vote Shortly after Johnson unveiled his \u201claddered\u201d CR over the weekend, the White House panned it as an \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cunserious proposal\u201d that would lead to more GOP chaos and dysfunction shortly after the party\u2019s three-week speaker debacle. But Monday, President Joe Biden would not commit to veto Johnson\u2019s laddered CR if it came to his desk. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a judgment on what I\u2019d veto and what I\u2019d sign. Let\u2019s see what they come up with,\u201d Biden told reporters. It's a remarkable reversal for Democrats. Just four days ago, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., ripped the laddered CR concept, saying neither Democrats nor the American public could understand it. \"The notion of a laddered CR is another extreme, right-wing policy joyride that is reckless and would only crash and burn the federal government,\" Jeffries said at his weekly news conference Thursday. \"It's a nonstarter.\" But Johnson's proposal is a so-called \"clean\" CR with no spending cuts and no controversial policy riders, a significant concession to Democratic demands. The two-step approach would extend funding for part of the government \u2014 including the Agriculture, Transportation and Veterans Affairs departments \u2014 through Jan. 19 and fund the Defense Department and other remaining parts of the government through Feb. 2. In a letter to colleagues Monday, Jeffries said that Congress' central mission is to keep the government funded and that top Democratic leaders \"are carefully evaluating the proposal set forth by Republican leadership and discussing it with Members.\" It's clear that Johnson will need to rely on Democrats to pass his first major legislation, given his razor-thin majority and the mounting GOP defections. Already, at least eight House conservatives have said they will vote no on Johnson\u2019s plan, and many more could join that group. After Rep.-elect Gabe Amo, D-R.I., is sworn in Monday, Johnson can afford to lose only three Republicans on his funding bill. At least one Democrat \u2014 Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is running for president against Biden \u2014 told NBC News he will vote for Johnson\u2019s bill.  \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a whole lot better than a shutdown,\u201d he said. In addition to delaying a fight over spending cuts until next year, the Johnson CR does not include other politically prickly issues like aid for Israel, Ukraine or Taiwan; humanitarian aid for Palestinians and others; and border security provisions. Those fights will be punted until after Thanksgiving. It would, however, extend the farm bill through Sept. 30 \u2014 a big sweetener for rural lawmakers and Democrats who like federal food and nutrition programs for low-income families. The two-part CR had been conceived by members of the far-right Freedom Caucus who see the staggered funding cliffs as a way to put pressure on Congress to reach deals on individual appropriations bills. But conservatives blasted the Johnson plan for a variety of reasons, including that it didn't include spending cuts or border provisions. \"We got nothing, nothing but an extension of the farm bill tagged onto a $1.6 trillion continuation of existing spending policies,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told reporters Monday. \"I can in no way sell that to a single one of my constituents.\" Other conservative Republicans opposing Johnson\u2019s CR plan include Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Warren Davidson of Ohio, Bob Good of Virginia, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and George Santos of New York. \u201cI will not support a status quo that fails to acknowledge fiscal irresponsibility, and changes absolutely nothing while emboldening a do-nothing Senate and a fiscally illiterate President,\u201d Perry, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said on X. An early test for Johnson's proposal will come Tuesday, when the House takes up the rule for the CR. Rules, which govern how legislation comes to the floor, are typically passed by the majority party, but in this case, Johnson may need some Democrats to pass the rule. More than 50 Democrats helped Republicans pass the rule on legislation to raise the debt ceiling in May. A GOP aide said leadership is also considering advancing the CR \"under suspension,\" which would require two-thirds support of the whole House if it doesn't have the GOP votes to pass the rule. Senators had been devising a Plan B to keep the government open, but it now appears they may not need to. Schumer announced Monday evening that the Senate was \"pausing on our plans\" to allow the House to move first. \"I've said on multiple occasions that if we're going to work together to keep the government open, Speaker Johnson will have to avoid pushing steep cuts or poison pills that Democrats can't support,\" Schumer said in a floor speech. \"For now, I am pleased that Speaker Johnson is moving in our direction.\" Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams defends role in Turkish consulate project amid FBI investigation",
        "content": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams defended his role in the new Turkish consulate building project on Sunday amid reports that he pressured the city to approve the building despite safety concerns. Shortly after winning the Democratic mayoral primary in 2021, Adams, then Brooklyn\u2019s borough president, reached out to Daniel Nigro, the New York City fire commissioner at the time, encouraging him to evaluate a request from the Turkish government to use the building, which had not yet opened because fire department officials had refused to sign off on the safety of its occupancy. Adams said in a statement Sunday via campaign spokesperson Evan Thies that part of his role as Brooklyn borough president was to \u201cnotify government agencies of issues on behalf of constituents and constituencies.\u201d \u201cI have not been accused of wrongdoing and I will continue to cooperate with investigators,\u201d he said. City Hall Chief Counsel Lisa Zornberg said in a statement Sunday that Adams and her team are cooperating with investigators. \u201cWe hope that investigators will continue to cooperate with us and reprimand any federal officer who has improperly leaked details about this investigation,\u201d Zornberg said, \u201cas such conduct could prejudice the public and undermines the integrity of our law enforcement process.\u201d The examination is part of an ongoing campaign fundraising investigation that led FBI agents to seize multiple electronic devices from Adams earlier this week. The mayor\u2019s team said this week that it had willingly alerted authorities involved in the federal investigation to someone who \u201cacted improperly.\u201d And at a news conference this week, Adams said he would be \u201cshocked\u201d if investigators find that his campaign had coordinated illegal behavior. Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter of the building project said Adams forwarded a September 2021 text requesting help from the Turkish consulate to Nigro, asking the fire commissioner to take a look at the issue of the building's occupancy. Nigro responded later saying a letter allowing occupancy would be handled by the following Monday, the sources said.  Adams said his text to the fire commissioner was a routine request. Adams had just won the democratic primary election for mayor at the time of the texts. A source familiar with the matter said former fire commissioner Nigro was questioned as a witness by the FBI at least twice \u2014 most recently on Nov 3. Reached by phone, Nigro said, \"I prefer not to comment at this time.\" Two sources familiar with the investigation said that safety officials at the FDNY signed off on a letter of occupancy with no objection, meaning the FDNY had reached an agreement with the building for added safety measures that would allow for access to the building. The sources added that the owners of the building wanted to gain access in part because Turkish leaders were soon coming to New York for the U.N. General Assembly. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney, the FBI and the Department of Interior declined to comment. A spokesman for the FDNY also declined comment. The Turkish Embassy in Washington has not responded to email requests for comment. News of questions about the Turkish consulate fire safety inspection were previously reported by The New York Times. It was last Monday that the FBI seized Adam\u2019s phones in connection with the criminal investigation. NBC New York reported earlier this month that Adams had raised more than $2 million for his re-election campaign in 2025. Adams, formerly a New York Police Department captain, had campaigned as a tough-on-crime Democrat who would increase the city\u2019s police staffing and funding. The Turkish consulate building, known as the Turkevi Center, in Manhattan still has a temporary certificate of occupancy, sources familiar with the matter said.  Adams has made numerous trips to Turkey in recent years and the timing of the consulate\u2019s opening coincided with a visit to New York by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. In July, six people were charged in an alleged scheme to divert tens of thousands of dollars to Adams\u2019 campaign through straw donors, or people whose names were used to subvert individual donation limits. Two pleaded guilty. On Nov. 2, the FBI searched the home of top campaign fundraiser Brianna Suggs. Part of the investigation focuses on whether money from overseas was improperly bundled into the mayor\u2019s 2021 campaign. Investigators are also looking into donations from people associated with KSK construction \u2014 a firm whose owners have ties to Turkey. The allegations, filed in state court, did not implicate Adams, and his representatives have said he did not have knowledge of the alleged scheme. No criminal charges have been filed in the matter and the investigation is ongoing.  Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Supreme Court adopts code of conduct amid ethics scrutiny",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday announced it has formally adopted what it called a new code of conduct following allegations of ethics lapses, although its impact is likely to be limited because the justices are left to enforce it themselves. The court issued a 14-page document that included five canons of conduct on issues such as when justices should recuse themselves and what kind of outside activities they can engage in. \"The undersigned justices are promulgating this Code of Conduct to set out succinctly and gather in one place the ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court,\" the justices said in an attached statement. All nine justices signed the statement. Most of the rules outlined in the code are not themselves new, the statement said, but the lack of a published code \"has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the justices of this court, unlike all other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\" The code, based on rules followed by lower court judges, appears to build on a statement the justices released in April saying they \u201creaffirm and restate\u201d their commitment to ethics principles \u2014 an announcement that failed to quell the criticism. Among other things, the code requires justices to \"uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary\" and \"avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.\" The court has been under pressure to act ever since a series of reports raised questions about whether justices were following the rules. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have proposed legislation that would impose a new ethics code on the court, with lawmakers saying they are being forced to act because of the justices' failure to do so. They welcomed the announcement but said it falls short of what they would like to see. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who chairs the committee, said the Supreme Court's actions were \"important steps, but they fall short of what we could and should expect,\" including by leaving too many decisions up to individual justices. \"For now, I will note that the court's adoption of this code marks a step in the right direction,\" he added. The failure to mention how complaints about ethics lapses would be enforced was an omission that Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., seized upon. \"This is a long-overdue step by the justices, but a code of ethics is not binding unless there is a mechanism to investigate possible violations and enforce the rules,\" he said in a statement.  What he called the \"honor system\" of individual justices' handling ethics issues has not worked, Whitehouse added. Gabe Roth, the executive director of ethics watchdog Fix the Court, had similar complaints. \"If the nine are going to release an ethics code with no enforcement mechanism and remain the only police of the nine, then how can the public trust they\u2019re going to do anything more than simply cover for one another, ethics be damned?\" he said in a statement. Progressives were dismissive of the court's announcement. A legal group on the left, the People's Parity Project, called it \"nothing more than a symbolic gesture aimed at quieting the ever-growing concerns surrounding the unethical behavior of sitting justices.\" Although Supreme Court justices follow some of the same rules that are imposed on lower court judges, such as a requirement that they file annual financial disclosure reports, they are not bound by the code of conduct that applies to other judges. The recent scrutiny was prompted by an April article by ProPublica that said Justice Clarence Thomas had taken trips funded by Republican billionaire Harlan Crow without disclosing them. ProPublica then reported in June that Justice Samuel Alito similarly failed to report a trip to Alaska in 2008. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee had been scheduled to vote on issuing subpoenas for Crow and conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, but the vote was abruptly postponed. In recent months, several justices have indicated support for the court's adopting its own code. Alito questioned whether Congress would have the legal authority to impose one on a separate branch of government. Republicans have complained that claims of ethics lapses have disproportionately focused on conservative judges. They have said Democrats want to delegitimize the Supreme Court because it has a 6-3 conservative majority that has issued several rulings that have enraged liberals, including rolling back the abortion rights landmark Roe v. Wade last year. Where the new code differs from the rules followed by lower court judges is on issues specific to the Supreme Court. The explanation of the rules notes, for example, that the approach to recusal in certain cases is tailored to the Supreme Court specifically. That\u2019s because the court has only nine justices and cases cannot be reassigned to anyone else if several justices are required to step aside. As a result, while justices are required to follow the normal rules for deciding whether they need to recuse because of conflicts of interest, they also have what the court calls a \u201cduty to sit\u201d if at all possible. The statement said Chief Justice John Roberts has directed that court employees can assist the justices in complying with the new rules, including by drawing up a list of best practices.

        "title": "Senate GOP campaign arm hits Rick Scott primary opponent with finance complaint",
        "content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 The Senate Republicans' official campaign arm in Washington is filing a complaint alleging that the Republican challenging GOP Sen. Rick Scott in 2024 used businesses he owns to make impermissible contributions to his campaign. The complaint from the National Republican Senatorial Committee is hitting Keith Gross, a Panama City, Florida, businessman and attorney who has said he would spend millions of dollars from his personal wealth to try and defeat Scott, a first-term senator and former two-term Florida governor. \u201cDespite this well-known prohibition, Keith Gross for Florida, and two businesses have engaged in a flagrant scheme to pump corporate resources into the struggling primary campaign,\u201d read the complaint, which is signed by NRSC Deputy General Counsel Blake Murphy. In response, Gross said, \"The FEC complaint filed by the NRSC against my campaign is entirely baseless. The expenses in question are completely legitimate and have been paid in accordance with FEC guidelines. This is typical swamp politics and the voters see right through it.\" Scott is one of the only Republican senators facing a potentially competitive campaign for re-election in 2024, when most of the battleground Senate seats up feature Democrats defending red or purple turf. Republicans need a net gain of two seats to flip the Senate, or one seat plus the presidency, so the vice president could break a 50-50 tie. The basis for the complaint stems from campaign finance reports in which Gross lists debts owed to Pure Blue and 1954 Capital Partners LLC, two companies he owns. Gross lists owing $13,500 to the first for business rentals and $12,600 to the second for aircraft rental. \u201cFederal law prohibits corporations, such as Pure Blue Inc. and likely 1954 Capital Partners LLC, from making contributions to Federal candidates,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cIf a corporation makes its resources available to one candidate for free, it must do so for all candidates.\u201d \u201cIn sum, Gross\u2019 campaign owes tens of thousands of dollars to corporation(s) owned and managed by Gross,\u201d it said. Pure Blue is a Montana-based company started in 2007 and lists Gross under \u201cprimary address,\u201d according to that state\u2019s corporate records. It has little online presence explaining what it is or does. 1954 Capital Partners is a Florida-based company Gross lists as an asset on a financial disclosure form filed ahead of his run for Senate. Those forms list him as an \"officer.\" Gross is considered a major underdog to Scott, but he has opened his campaign on an aggressive note, attacking Scott directly and saying he can spend upward of $30 million in personal funds as part of the race. Gross has consistently poked fun at the policy plan Scott unveiled during the 2022 midterms, when he chaired the NRSC. It became a point of contention between Scott and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and led Scott to make an unsuccessful run to oust McConnell as caucus leader.  Gross is new to Florida politics, but has run for office in the past. In September, NBC News reported that Gross was kicked off the ballot when running as a Democrat for a seat in Georgia's state House. A judge in that case was \u201ctroubled\u201d by Gross\u2019 attempts to prove he lived in the state and the House district long enough to be eligible.

        "title": "Liberal justices object as Supreme Court rejects prisoner's exercise claim",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday refused to weigh under what circumstances prisoners in solitary confinement have a constitutional right to exercise, turning away an Illinois inmate's claim that he was denied the opportunity for three years. The court's three liberal justices disagreed with the decision not to take up the case, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing a lengthy dissenting opinion in which she called the inmate's treatment \"unusually severe.\" The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Michael Johnson, who initially represented himself in legal proceedings, was barred from the normal one hour of exercise in an outdoor yard, typically available five days a week, between 2013 and 2016, his lawyers said in court papers. Under prison rules, exercise privileges can be withdrawn temporarily for violations. Johnson, who has mental health issues, was cited more than 70 times between 2008 and August 2016 for his conduct. Johnson, 42, claims that the refusal to allow him to exercise as a result of his repeatedly disobeying prison rules violated his right not to be inflicted with cruel and unusual punishment under the Constitution's 8th Amendment. He appealed to the Supreme Court after the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the state in March 2022 and subsequently declined to reconsider the case, with the judges split 5-5. In an opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, Jackson said Johnson should have been allowed to pursue his claim that officials were deliberately indifferent to his health needs. \"The consequences of such a prolonged period of exercise deprivation were predictable severe. Most notably, Johnson's mental state deteriorated rapidly,\" Jackson wrote. Lower courts, she added, failed to \"consider the impact of cumulative exercise deprivation on Johnson's physical and mental health, or what was known to prison officials about the risks of such deprivation.\" Daniel Greenfield, one of Johnson's lawyers, said that while he was grateful for Jackson's opinion, \"we are saddened to live in an era where imposing such cruelty \u2014 let alone on a person known to suffer from mental illness \u2014 is acceptable to any federal judge.\" A spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Corrections said officials were reviewing the decision but had no additional comment. The actions of prison officials served to exacerbate Johnson's mental health issues, his lawyers said in court papers. \"His muscles withered, he repeatedly smeared feces on his body, endured hallucinations, and compulsively picked at his own flesh, and he required 'suicide watch' time and again,\" they wrote. Illinois Solicitor General Jane Notz, representing the state, said in a court filing that the appeals court ruling followed precedent, saying that yard restrictions do not violate the Constitution as long as they are supported by valid prison management policies. Johnson has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and severe depression. He was eventually moved to a mental health unit in 2016. After serving his sentence, Johnson was released in 2019, but after being convicted of battery he was until last month serving a new sentence in a facility that provides psychiatric care.

        "title": "Chris Christie reaches donor threshold for fourth GOP debate as he pushes to qualify",
        "content": "HANOVER, N.H. \u2014 Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has amassed support from the 80,000 donors needed to qualify for the fourth Republican presidential debate in December, as he pushes to remain on the stage even while one of his rivals from last week\u2019s debate, Sen. Tim Scott, just suspended his campaign. Christie's campaign says it has seen a \u201csurge of organic support.\u201d  \u201cComing off the heels of Christie\u2019s strong performance at the third debate last week, we\u2019ve seen the best week since he announced, bringing in thousands of new donors in just the few days since,\u201d the campaign told NBC News.  It also pointed to a flash poll conducted after the Republican debate in Miami by 538/Washington Post/Ipsos that showed a large jump in Christie\u2019s favorability ratings post-debate. It will take additional time for other polls to confirm that finding, either nationally or in early-voting states. In the meantime, Christie\u2019s campaign says his message is resonating with voters.  \u201cChristie is the only candidate with the courage to consistently tell the hard truths about Donald Trump and make the case for the serious leadership needed for these serious times,\u201d it says.   Christie still has to clear the Republican National Committee\u2019s polling thresholds to qualify for the fourth debate, according to an NBC News analysis of the requirements. The RNC requires candidates to reach at least 6% in two national polls \u2014 or 6% in one national poll and two polls from different early primary states.  The Christie campaign did point to two national polls to argue that the former governor has met the polling threshold for the fourth debate, but both could run afoul of the RNC\u2019s rules. One national survey from the Liberal Patriot/YouGov that found Christie at 10% was conducted from Sept. 14-18, and the RNC\u2019s guidelines say qualifying polls must be conducted on or after Sept. 15. The second national survey from WPA Intelligence and FairVote, could violate the RNC\u2019s rule that polls must not be conducted by firms \u201caffiliated with a candidate or candidate committee,\u201d since WPA Intelligence conducts polling for Never Back Down, the super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Christie so far does appear to have hit the polling threshold in at least two New Hampshire surveys, but he has yet to hit at least 6% in a national survey or a poll from another early state that meets the RNC\u2019s methodological criteria, according to NBC News\u2019 analysis. But the push to qualify suggests that Christie is aiming to stay in the 2024 campaign through at least the early states, even as Scott and another rival, former Vice President Mike Pence, have dropped out in recent weeks. Four other candidates do appear to have met the RNC\u2019s donor and polling requirements: former President Donald Trump, DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. But Trump is not expected to attend the debate, which is set for Dec. 6 in Alabama, after skipping all three Republican debates so far this year. Emma Barnett is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

        "content": "Less than 24 hours after a surprise announcement that he was dropping his presidential bid, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is visiting with staff at the campaign's Charleston headquarters, according to a campaign official \u2014 following a short Sunday night call with bewildered campaign workers who were surprised by the end of Scott's 2024 run. Scott acknowledged to his staff that the announcement \u2014 made during an evening appearance on Fox News \u2014 \u201cmay have caught you by surprise.\u201d But he argued that he tried to be \u201cstrategic\u201d with the timing and fashion of the drop-out, according to multiple sources on the call. It all marks an official and swift end to Scott\u2019s monthslong presidential quest, one marred by a media-shy campaign strategy, senior staff lacking presidential campaign experience and, most of all, a GOP electorate reluctant to leave former President Donald Trump behind. Scott saw his positive conservative message as something that embodied everything the GOP once hoped to aspire to. But it also represents much of what the GOP has left behind in its quest to stay true to Trump and his vitriolic brand of politics. Multiple sources close to the Scott campaign say the senator\u2019s bid was hampered by \u201cleadership that never figured themselves out,\u201d noting several \u201cstrategic errors\u201d that affected the campaign\u2019s ability to capitalize on a surge of momentum it experienced in August ahead of the Iowa state fair and the first primary debate. A source close to the campaign\u2019s leadership called that criticism \u201cnonsense,\u201d citing an electorate that remained supportive of Trump above all others. And while the fashion with which Scott left the race was shocking, the writing was on the wall that the campaign was coming to a close. Only a few weeks prior, Scott\u2019s team decided to go \u201call in\u201d on Iowa, shifting resources to the Hawkeye State. When announcing the move to staff \u2014 widely seen as a last-ditch move by flagging campaigns \u2014 top brass, including campaign manager Jennifer DeCasper and communications director Nathan Brand, were speaking from a moving car, with cellphone signals breaking up in frustrating fashion for those listening in. Scott was also in the car during the call. Scott didn't say a word during the call, according to four sources with knowledge of the event, even as he shared the line with the people who\u2019d moved their lives to work for his presidential dream. The pro-Scott super PAC, Trust In the Mission, or, TIM PAC, also abandoned him, canceling millions in planned ad buys in the early primary states and telling donors in a blunt October memo: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to waste our money when the electorate isn\u2019t focused or ready for a Trump alternative.\u201d Though widely talked about as a possible vice presidential pick, whether for Trump or another nominee, Scott signaled Sunday night that he's not rushing to endorse anyone else for president. But in leaving the race Sunday, Scott vowed to staff that his \u201cmission\u201d would continue. In what form, that remains to be seen.

In a comment on his Truth Social website, Trump called Smith, former Justice Department official Andrew Weissmann and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco a \"team of losers and misfits\" from CREW, an ethics watchdog group. He also attacked \"all the rest of the Radical Left Zealots and Thugs who have been working illegally for years to 'take me down.'\" They will end up, Trump said, \"suffering from a horrible disease, TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME (TDS!), in a Mental Institution by the time my next term as President is successfully completed. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Smith has been overseeing the federal investigations into Trump's mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House and his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The probes led to indictments charging Trump in each case. The election interference case is set to begin in March 2024 in Washington, D.C., while the classified documents case is expected to start in Fort Pierce, Florida, in May 2024. Trump has repeatedly disparaged Smith, other DOJ prosecutors and federal judges involved in the various legal cases against him. Trump faced a gag order in the federal election interference case which prohibited him from making statements about potential witnesses or critical comments about the federal prosecutors who charged him. However, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit temporarily paused the order from Judge Tanya Chutkan earlier this month. The hold is in effect until after the appeals court hears oral arguments on Nov. 20 on Trump's request for the gag order to be permanently removed. Smith's office and Weissmann declined to comment.

        "title": "Jack Smith's team says Trump wants a 'carnival' at his election interference trial",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith's office said Monday that former President Donald Trump wants a \"carnival atmosphere\" at his federal election interference trial, which is set to get underway in the nation's capital in March. Trump is facing a four-count indictment, returned in August, that charges he participated in a conspiracy \"to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election by using knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the government function by which those results are collected, counted and certified.\" NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, and other media outlets are arguing for the trial to be televised. Trump's attorney previously told Smith's office that they took no position on whether the trial should be televised, but then changed course in a politically-heated filing proclaiming that Smith's office knew that the charges against Trump are \"meritless\" and is seeking to \"proceed in secret, forcing the nation and the world to rely on biased, secondhand accounts coming from the Biden Administration and its media allies.\" There was not much legal argument in the court filing, which The New York Times referred to as \"short on legal arguments and long on bluster.\" Trump's trial is very unlikely to be televised, given that federal criminal proceedings have never been aired on television, and broadcasting criminal trials violates the federal rules on criminal procedure. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan for the District of Columbia has repeatedly stated that she will treat Trump like any other criminal defendant and that broadcasting his trial would be a major departure from the norm. In its filing Monday, Smith's team said that there's a \"constitutionally-sound broadcast prohibition that has governed federal criminal trials \u2014 no matter the defendant \u2014 for decades\" and that there's no reason to depart from common practice. Trump \"may elect to craft court filings with the goal of gathering media coverage rather than lawful relief from the Court, as he appears to have done on this and many other occasions,\" but there's no reason to make an exception to the rule for his case, the team argued. Trump desires \"to create a carnival atmosphere from which he hopes to profit by distracting, like many fraud defendants try to do, from the charges against him,\" Smith's team said. \"As the Court has already observed in proceedings in the defendant\u2019s criminal trial, the defendant and his counsel will, if permitted, design their in-court statements instead to wage a public relations campaign.\" Trump \"ignores that high-profile federal criminal trials have long proceeded in accordance with the broadcast prohibition under the rules\u2014and that they have garnered significant and detailed media coverage of courtroom proceedings nonetheless,\" the team wrote, citing the trial of one of the Boston Marathon bombers, a co-conspirator in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the Oklahoma City bomber. \"This has remained true in the context of trials related to the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol, including on seditious conspiracy charges,\" Smith's team wrote, citing the trials of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.

        "content": "Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., announced Monday that she won't seek re-election to Congress next year to run for governor of Virginia in 2025. Spanberger declared her candidacy for governor in a campaign video posted on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Our country and our commonwealth are facing fundamental threats to our rights, our freedoms and to our democracy,\"  Spanberger said. \"While some politicians in Richmond focus on banning abortion and books, what they\u2019re not doing is helping people.\" Spanberger said Virginians must stop \"extremists from shedding women\u2019s reproductive rights\" and \"using teachers and our kids as political pawns.\" \"Even in this moment of deep division, we can seize the opportunity,\" she said. \"I am running to serve all Virginians in every community across our commonwealth, because it\u2019s about time we do what\u2019s right for everyone.\" Virginia Democrats reclaimed full control of the General Assembly in last week\u2019s election. Spanberger is in her third term as the representative of Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District. Democrats will have to defend her competitive seat in Congress in 2024.  Spanberger is seeking to fill Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s seat after his term ends in January 2026. Under the state\u2019s constitution, Youngkin cannot run for a consecutive term.  Youngkin faced tough losses during his state elections last week as Democrats won control of the full Legislature, defending their majority in the Senate and flipping the House. He had told voters that he would want a GOP-controlled Legislature to enact a 15-week abortion ban in the next term, which voters rebuffed. Spanberger appears likely to have Democratic challengers in the governor's race. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, for example, told the Richmond-Times Dispatch in April that he was planning to run for governor in 2025.  The race for Spanberger's congressional seat is expected to be competitive, with Republicans in narrow control of the U.S. House. She is one of several House Democrats who have decided not to run for re-election in recent days. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., announced Sunday that he would step down in February, citing his frustrations with the dysfunction in Washington.

        "content": "Maryanne Trump Barry, former President Donald Trump's older sister and a retired federal judge, has died, two sources said. She was 86. Barry was a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia and retired in 2019, ending a civil misconduct inquiry that was launched after reporting by The New York Times alleged the then-president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes. After her brother won the 2016 presidential election, Barry gave up her court staff and took inactive status in early 2017, The Associated Press reported. President Ronald Reagan appointed Barry, a Republican, to the U.S. District Court for New Jersey in 1983. In 1999, she was appointed to the 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia by President Bill Clinton. The Daily Voice first reported Barry's death. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Barry came under scrutiny after a 2018 New York Times report alleged that Trump family patriarch Fred Trump and his children orchestrated a tax scheme to inflate the family fortune and possibly evade taxes. Barry was a senior judge on the 3rd Circuit court when the report was published but had stopped actively hearing cases. Fred Trump \u201coften\u201d consulted with Barry on legal matters during her time as a federal judge, the Times reported. Barry was also reportedly present at meetings at Trump Tower in 2003 \u201cfor one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire\u201d with the siblings and then-Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg and the company were charged with tax fraud in 2021 by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. He pleaded guilty, and the company was convicted at trial.) According to the Times, citing records and interviews, Donald Trump and his siblings \u201cset up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents,\u201d and properties were transferred to him and his siblings using questionable tax planning. Although the Times did not explicitly list which of the siblings were involved with the \u201csham corporation,\u201d the report suggests all Trump siblings, including Barry, had at least benefited from the scheme. After the Times report was published, a judicial panel launched a civil misconduct inquiry into Barry in response to four citizen complaints. Barry\u2019s voluntary retirement in April 2019 ended the review that was prompted by claims based on the Times report. Barry also drew attention when The Washington Post reported in 2020 on a secretly recorded audio of her criticizing her brother as a liar with \u201cno principles.\u201d The audio, which NBC News also obtained, was secretly recorded by Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump, a vocal critic of him. Mary Trump recorded more than 15 hours of discussion between her and Barry in 2018 and 2019 and released parts of the records to corroborate her 2020 book about the Trump family, \"Too Much and Never Enough.\" Trump allies swiftly came to his defense after the audio was released. The former president\u2019s younger brother, Robert Trump, died in 2020. His funeral was held at the White House.

The source did not believe she witnessed any of it. D.C. police referred all questions to the Secret Service. Naomi Biden, 29, got married last year to Peter Neal at the White House, the first wedding with a president\u2019s granddaughter as the bride, and the first one in that location, the White House Historical Association said.

        "title": "Donald Trump Jr. back on the witness stand in N.Y. civil fraud trial",
        "content": "Donald Trump Jr. returned to the witness stand Monday as lawyers of former President Donald Trump began presenting their case in the $250 million civil fraud trial that poses threats to the Trump family\u2019s real estate empire. \"You thought you were rid of me, your honor,\" Trump Jr. told Judge Arthur Engoron as he began to testify in the case for the second time in two weeks. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s good to be here, your honor, but I think the attorney general would sue me for perjury,\u201d he quipped later. Asked for an overview of the family company, the Trump Organization, Trump Jr. described it as \"an international organization\" that's \"run like a mom-and-pop.\" He then gave an extensive rundown of its various holdings, including Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mar-a-Lago in Florida and various golf courses. He praised his father's \"vision\" and at times seemed to emulate the former president's speech patterns, referring to various properties as \"amazing,\" \"spectacular\" and \"incredible.\" Trump Jr. also talked about the power structure at the Trump Organization before his father became president. \"There is my father\" and then \"everyone else,\" he said. He also described the company, which is now run by him and his brother, as a \"meritocracy.\" \"You need to deliver results, and he gave a lot of people opportunities,\" he said of his father. Asked about the company's plans for the future, he said, much of it has to do with \"what happens next November\" and \"whether we are sued into oblivion for the foreseeable future.\" During cross-examination, Colleen Faherty of New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office brought up two of the properties Trump Jr. had gushed about in his direct testimony, a building at 40 Wall St. in Manhattan and a Trump hotel in Hawaii. Faherty asked Trump Jr. whether he was aware the Wall Street property had been on a watchlist since February because of an increased number of vacancies. He said he was not aware. She then asked whether he knew the owner of the hotel in Hawaii was removing the Trump name from the property. \"If they want to buy it out for millions of dollars, then we are OK with that,\" he said.  Afterward, Trump Jr. told reporters he thought the cross-examination was \"boring\" and maintained that the case is a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" \"It always has been,\" he said. Asked by NBC News whether he still planned to appeal Engoron's pretrial ruling that the company had engaged in repeated fraud, he said, \"I have to.\" Trump Jr. was the first witness for the defense. His testimony was followed that of by Sheri Dillon, one of Trump's tax attorneys. Trump Jr.'s younger brother Eric Trump and his father are expected to be back on the stand later as the defense presents its case. None were cross-examined by the defense after their initial testimony. Testifying as defense witnesses gives their attorneys greater leeway in their questioning and allows them to control the narrative of their testimony, although each will be subject to cross-examination by the AG's office. Trump attorney Chris Kise has said he expects they'll wrap up their presentation by Dec. 15. Prosecutors rested their case Wednesday while reserving the right to recall Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's former chief financial officer. Weisselberg and the company were hit with tax fraud charges in 2021 by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Weisselberg pleaded guilty, and the company was convicted at trial. Upon entering the Oval Office in 2017, Trump handed off management of his company to his adult sons and named Trump Jr. as a trustee. Trump Jr. took the stand earlier this month, answering questions about his role at the Trump Organization and the degree of his involvement in financial statements that James\u2019 office alleges were inflated to benefit the company. The former president, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump also testified this month. James alleges the Trumps have been engaged in a yearslong scheme of exaggerating their business assets. Engoron, who is presiding over the nonjury trial in Manhattan, partly sided with James\u2019 office in a ruling in September, finding that the Trumps had repeatedly committed acts of fraud for years.  The Trumps have denied wrongdoing against the allegations that they inflated the company's net worth by billions of dollars on financial statements, with the former president repeatedly claiming the case is a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" Trump testified that any errors in the statements were \u201cnonmaterial.\u201d \u201cI think that the statements of financial condition were very good, were actually somewhat conservative and in some cases very conservative,\u201d Trump said, claiming that some properties were actually worth even more than what was listed in his financial statements, which he said were prepared by his accountants. Both Trump Jr. and Eric Trump testified that they barely had any involvement with the annual financial statements of the company, which they had signed. They said they relied on the accounting firm they had hired. \u201cI rely on the accountants,\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cThey were intimately involved in every aspect\u201d of the statements. Eric Trump claimed similarly when he was asked during his testimony what due diligence he performed on the financial statements: \u201cI relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.\u201d Ivanka Trump also denied involvement with her father\u2019s financial statements and claimed she lacked insight into their preparation. \u201cI would assume he would have personal financial statements that he would work on with his own accountants, but those weren\u2019t things that I was privy to,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cit was not something that I was involved in.\u201d Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "Jacob Chansley, the Arizona man who gained notoriety as the \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, filed paperwork to run for Congress as a Libertarian candidate in the battleground state\u2019s 8th Congressional District. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., announced last month that she won\u2019t seek re-election. Chansley stood out among the Capitol rioters by appearing shirtless with face paint, wearing a furry headdress with horns and carrying a U.S. flag affixed to a spear and a bullhorn.   Chansley pleaded guilty to a single count of felony obstruction of an official proceeding. A federal judge in 2021 sentenced Chansley to 41 months in prison. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors described him as the \u201cpublic face of the Capitol riot.\u201d Chansley was among the initial group of rioters to enter the building, and he used a bullhorn \u201cto rile up the crowd and demand that lawmakers be brought out,\u201d the sentencing memo said. Chansley shouted obscenities in the Senate gallery and climbed the chamber\u2019s dais, the memo said. He photographed himself there, refused officers\u2019 orders to leave and left a note that read: \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!\u201d Prosecutors noted that Chansley, who pushed the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, used social media to spread \u201cfalse information and hateful rhetoric\u201d that provoked the Capitol attack. Chansley served about 27 months in prison before he was transferred to a halfway house in Phoenix in March, according to The Associated Press. At a hearing, his original lawyer, Albert Watkins, said Chansley no longer wanted to be known as the \u201cQAnon Shaman.\u201d At his sentencing hearing, Chansley expressed remorse for his actions, which he called \u201cindefensible.\u201d \u201cI was wrong for entering the Capitol,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cI have no excuse.

        "title": "Biden struggles to quell backlash in party over Israel\u2019s response to Hamas",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Joe Biden came of age, he saw Israel as a besieged state that was a haven for a persecuted Jewish minority, a worldview that stayed with him through his 36 years in the Senate and his rise to the presidency. Biden often recalls in public speeches what former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told him 50 years ago: \u201cWe have nowhere else to go.\u201d Today, a faction of Biden\u2019s party sees Israel very differently: as a military colossus run by far-right officials who\u2019ve suppressed Palestinians and denied them basic freedoms. These dueling perceptions are the root of a fresh foreign policy crisis that is tearing at Biden\u2019s political coalition and putting him in the awkward spot of reining in a Jewish state he has long revered. The diplomatic challenge would bedevil any president. But it may be even more excruciating for Biden, who took his children to view the Nazi death camps and who calls himself a \u201cZionist in my heart.\u201d As Israeli leaders\u2019 most important partner, Biden finds himself needing to help them defeat Hamas while limiting civilian bloodshed in crowded cities where the militants operate. He must reassure an anxious Jewish population without alienating Arab and Muslim Americans who argue that his nostalgia for Israel is outdated. Beyond that, he needs to avoid escalation so that a contained conflict in the Middle East doesn\u2019t draw in other countries and devolve into a global conflagration. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he warned Middle East adversaries who may have considered attacking Israel. So far, they haven\u2019t. \u201cHe\u2019s really trying to strike a balance in a challenging public opinion and military environment,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the potential for escalation, and the president has done very well in deterring Iran and Hezbollah by sending in aircraft carriers and other military actions.\u201d Less successful is Biden\u2019s attempt to unify his own country. The damage wrought by Israel\u2019s military response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 ignited a backlash that the White House has struggled to quell. Muslim leaders in Michigan and Minnesota have held protests and news conferences in recent weeks with the rallying cry, \u201cAbandon Biden.\u201d Scores of Biden campaign alumni wrote a letter to him last week calling on him to pressure Israel to stand down. While nearly 70% of Democrats approve of Biden\u2019s job performance overall, the number drops to 50% when it comes to his handling of the conflict in Gaza, an Associated Press-NORC survey showed. Inside Congress, some Democratic lawmakers are urging the White House to take a more critical tone in public statements on the war or risk losing crucial support in battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cI would like to see more aggressive and more clear public rhetoric. People around the country would like to see that,\u201d said one moderate Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk more freely. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass., a former presidential candidate, said she is in touch with constituents \u201cwho are deeply disturbed about the extreme number of civilian casualties and who want to see Israel live up to its obligation to respect civilians. The U.S. has a responsibility to be a good ally, and part of that is to remind our friends of the importance of abiding by international law and protecting civilians.\u201d Warren declined to say whether she has shared this perspective directly with Biden. (Asked about the warnings coming from Capitol Hill, a White House aide said that while some lawmakers have told the administration that they\u2019d like to hear a different tone, many others offered praise for standing up for Israel\u2019s self-defense). Biden has called upon Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to minimize casualties, but has not used all the leverage at his disposal, critics of his approach say. Some Democrats said it\u2019s time for the U.S. to attach conditions to the $14 billion aid package requested by the White House. It is doubtful, though, that a majority in Congress would go along with such a move. \u201cIsrael would be weighing things very differently\u201d if Biden were not only to cajole Israel to avoid civilian casualties but also to withhold U.S. weaponry unless Israel complied, said Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American civil rights attorney from Michigan, in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t claim to care about Palestinian civilians and then ship out billions of dollars worth of military aid to Israel to continue killing Palestinian civilians,\u201d said Arraf, a delegate to the 2020 Democratic National Convention who now says she won\u2019t vote to re-elect Biden. Amid the mounting death toll in Gaza, Biden\u2019s party is splintering ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Younger, progressive Democrats have aligned with Arab Americans in demanding a cease-fire in Gaza that Biden won\u2019t endorse. Asked about the chances of a cease-fire last week, Biden flatly told reporters: \u201cNone. No possibility.\u201d In opposing a cease-fire, Biden has aligned himself with Israeli leaders who argue that it would give Hamas fighters time to regroup and defer the ultimate goal of preventing more surprise attacks coming from Gaza. \u201cWhen somebody proves unable to call for a cease-fire, it means they are condoning the brutal murder of Palestinian children each and every single day,\u201d said Abdullah Hammoud, mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, a majority Arab American city that voted for Biden over Donald Trump in 2020 by 3-to-1. \u201cMy question for the president is, when is it OK to murder innocent children and how long will it take him to call for a cease-fire? That\u2019s what speaks volumes to us here in the city.\u201d Mindful of the criticism, the White House is reaching out to Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim Americans in hopes of explaining its approach to the war. Senior White House aides held at least two private Zoom calls over the past week to allay growing concerns about Israel\u2019s counterattack. Both calls had a similar format, with senior White House advisers Stephen Benjamin and Neera Tanden taking part, a person familiar with the matter said. Neither call appears to have placated critics of Biden\u2019s posture. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, who took part in one such call last week, said in an interview: \u201cWe were called to a meeting that was billed as Arab American engagement that didn\u2019t include many of the community leaders. It felt more like they were checking a box than really listening to our needs and how to meet them.\u201d A separate call included about 10 Palestinian American leaders. The White House officials opened by talking about their efforts to counter Islamophobia and get humanitarian aid to suffering residents of Gaza, one participant said in an interview. When the guests mentioned they wanted to see the Biden administration. insist on a cease-fire, the White House aides made plain that wasn\u2019t going to happen, this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt was painful,\u201d the participant said. \u201cOur people are dying. The point of the cease-fire is to stop that pain. Stop the killing.\u201d Another White House official said of the meetings: \u201cThe president understands that the consequences of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel and Hamas\u2019 decision to hide amongst civilians has caused tremendous pain in communities across the country. That\u2019s why officials at the highest level of this administration have and will continue to engage and solicit input from leaders who advocate for a wide range of policies.\u201d Although Biden is by now keenly aware of the discontent among younger progressives, it\u2019s far from clear he knows what to do about it, Democratic activists say. How voters see Israel may hinge on where they fall in the generational divide. Biden is part of an older generation that recalls a time when Israeli leaders engaged in peace talks with Arab and Palestinian counterparts and signed agreements brokered by past presidents. But for younger Americans, the face of Israel may be Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and a polarizing figure there and in the U.S. Netanyahu\u2019s government has approved an expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a step backward if the ultimate goal is a peace accord that gives Palestinians their own sovereign state, supporters of a two-state solution say. A Quinnipiac poll last month underscored how differently the generations view the Middle East conflict. Voters between the ages of 18 and 34 disapproved of the U.S. sending weapons to Israel coming off the Hamas attack by a margin of 51% to 39%, the poll showed. By contrast, a majority of voters in all older age groups approved. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive change from anything these people [at the White House] have dealt with,\u201d said one Democratic activist steeped in the Middle East debates in Congress. \u201cThere are a lot of people there who\u2019ve been in business for 40-plus years, doing things a certain way. This is definitely rocking their world.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s coming at them hard and fast,\u201d this person added. Peter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Tim Scott drops out of the 2024 presidential race",
        "content": "Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina announced Sunday night that he is dropping out of the 2024 Republican presidential campaign, shocking a TV interviewer and even his own campaign staff with an abrupt departure from the race. \u201cWhen I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,\" Scott said in an appearance on former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy's Fox News program. \"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear that they\u2019re telling me: not now,\" Scott continued. The announcement was a surprise: Gowdy, a former colleague of Scott's in the House of Representatives, appeared to do a double-take as he made his statement. Multiple Scott staffers told NBC News they got no warning he was ending the campaign, finding out only by watching him say so on TV. Scott's campaign even sent out a fundraising email not long before he announced he was leaving the race. \"We want to give you ONE LAST CHANCE to donate this weekend and help Tim reach his campaign goal. Can you chip in to help Tim win?\" the campaign wrote. His decision comes amid efforts to consolidate the GOP opposition to former President Donald Trump, who has big leads in primary polls, including in the first caucus state, Iowa. Scott took 7% support there in the October NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, putting him in fourth place. Scott's dropout also comes days after the third Republican presidential debate in Miami, after which he canceled a scheduled weekend campaign swing in Iowa, citing the flu. Scott started the 2024 campaign relatively little-known compared to some of his competitors. His campaign and an allied super PAC spent nearly $25 million on ads in Iowa and other early states promoting him as an optimistic conservative, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking service. Scott saw an uptick in early-state polls soon through the summer. But money started to grow tight leading up to Sunday\u2019s dropout, according to a source familiar with the campaign. Scott never caught fire in the GOP debates. And his poll numbers stagnated as an in-state rival caught attention. He is dropping out of the race just as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has pulled into second place in early-state primary polls. Haley, who appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012, praised him on X, the social media platform. \"Tim Scott is a good man of faith and an inspiration to so many. The Republican primary was made better by his participation in it. South Carolina is blessed to continue to have him as our senator,\" she wrote. Last month, Scott\u2019s super PAC canceled millions of dollars in planned fall advertising, saying the Republican electorate wasn\u2019t \u201cfocused or ready for a Trump alternative.\u201d \u201cThere comes a point when it\u2019s clear that there isn\u2019t going to be a breakthrough moment, and one was really needed given where he stood in the field,\" a Scott campaign staffer said. The staffer praised Scott's message and personal favorability numbers, \"but they never translated into support, and that\u2019s just the reality of what it takes to win \u2014 and if you don\u2019t have a path, it\u2019s time to help consolidate to beat Trump.\" While Scott's voters are now going to have to find another candidate, he indicated in the interview with Gowdy that he wasn't looking to endorse one of his former rivals at this time. \"I\u2019m going to recommend that the voters study each candidate and their candidacies and, frankly, their past and make a decision for the future of the country,\" he said. \"The best way for me to be helpful is to not weigh in on who they should endorse.\" And Scott seemed uninterested in the idea of becoming a candidate for vice president later on in the campaign. \"Vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it\u2019s certainly not there now,\" he told Gowdy. Scott is leaving the race after another well-known candidate dropped out. Former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his campaign in late October, as the Republican presidential field winnows down. Several of Scott's former 2024 rivals reacted to the news on social media. \u201cTim Scott is a strong conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on track. I respect his courage to run this campaign and thank him for his service to America and the U.S. Senate. I look forward to Tim continuing to be a leader in our party for years to come,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on X. Vivek Ramaswamy praised Scott as a \"good dude\" before referring to an interaction the two had onstage at last week's Republican debate (and taking a dig at Haley). \"I gave @SenatorTimScott a congratulatory [gold fist bump emoji] on stage when the other South Carolinian shamelessly copied *exactly* what he said,\" Ramaswamy posted on X. \"Wishing Tim all the best back in the U.S. Senate.\" Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

        "title": "RNC's Ronna McDaniel says GOP must talk about abortion following election losses",
        "content": "Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Sunday in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the GOP needs to talk about the issue of abortion after its major losses in last week\u2019s election showed that the issue remains a liability for the party heading into 2024. More than a year after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, abortion rights continued to show up as a winning issue for Democrats in last week\u2019s elections in several states. Voters in Ohio supported a state constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights by double digits. Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who made the issue a key message of his campaign in a deep-red state, won re-election. Democrats in Virginia maintained their majority in the Senate and flipped the state House in a move that appears to push back on GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who advocated for a 15-week abortion ban as part of his campaign\u2019s platform. \u201cNBC News is reporting that in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s results, the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans is calling on candidates to clearly oppose a national abortion ban in TV ads and speeches,\u201d host Kristen Welker told McDaniel during the interview. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to weigh in, but just big picture, is that a smart strategy? Is that the right approach?\u201d she asked. McDaniel said she\u2019s \u201cnot a policy person\u201d and that the RNC will leave it up to legislators, senators and members of Congress to \u201cstake their lane out,\u201d but acknowledged that the party must address the issue of abortion rights going forward. \u201cDemocrats are going to make it a national issue, though. And I do think we have to talk about this issue, because the Democrats will say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take it to the Senate and codify it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, I think there\u2019s a lot of discussion to be had, but we can\u2019t just say it\u2019s a state\u2019s issue and be done.\u201d Asked about whether she supports a 15-week limit on abortion as a policy for the Republican Party to get behind, McDaniel said: \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision about federal or state\u201d restrictions on abortion. McDaniel noted that Democrats outspent Republicans on ads about abortion access, before reiterating that it\u2019s an issue that the GOP needs to talk about. \u201cWe have to talk about it, and you can\u2019t hide in a corner and think abortion\u2019s not going to be an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what Democrats are running on, because they can\u2019t run on crime, they can\u2019t run on the border, they can\u2019t run on fentanyl.\u201d \u201c$350 million in 2022 was spent on this issue \u2014 we just saw it again in Ohio and Virginia,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are lessons we have to take, and it\u2019s going to be up to the candidates to go on TV and say it.\u201d After experiencing more significant losses last week, Republicans say it\u2019s time to refine their message on abortion before they suffer more losses at the ballot box. While Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have signaled that they intend to pin the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that overturned Roe on former President Donald Trump next year if he is the GOP nominee, Republican presidential candidates have taken different approaches to addressing the issue of abortion. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed a 15-week abortion ban into law in 2022, has said he would sign it into federal law if he is elected president. However, his campaign manager, James Uthmeier, told ABC News last week that it\u2019s an \u201cextreme hypothetical.\u201d \u201cHe is going to sign pro-life legislation, but he recognizes in the wake of the Dobbs decision that states will come down differently,\u201d Uthmeier said. \u201cAnd we as conservatives have to do a better job of messaging and working on the issue.\u201d Uthmeier added that Congress is \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and is unlikely to pass a bill with a 15-week abortion ban. Although she has framed herself as anti-abortion, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has repeatedly said that she would like to see some \u201cconsensus\u201d among Republicans on the issue.

        "title": "36-hour shifts, 80-hour weeks: Workers are being burned out by overtime",
        "content": "Virginia Beach firefighter Max Gonano was coming off a 24-hour shift on Father\u2019s Day when he was told he\u2019d have to work another 12 hours to cover for a staffing shortfall. By the time he got off work at 8 p.m., he\u2019d missed the day with his 2-year-old and 4-year-old children and spent 36 hours straight at work. Long shifts with little rest and last-minute schedule changes have become a routine occurrence for Gonano and his colleagues, who have worked six times the amount of mandatory overtime hours this year that they did before the pandemic. From firehouses and police stations to hospitals and manufacturing plants, workers say they are being required to work increasing overtime hours to make up for post-pandemic worker shortages \u2014 leaving them sleep-deprived, scrambling to cover child care duties, and missing birthdays, holidays and vacations. While the extra hours can provide a financial boost, some workers say the trade-off is no longer worth it as they see no end in sight to a problem that has now lasted for several years. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to that fever pitch moment,\u201d said Gonano, who is president of the Virginia Beach Professional Fire and EMS union. \u201cIt\u2019s just rampant. People are tired of working all the overtime. It\u2019s definitely causing morale issues.\u201d Staffing shortages have plagued the economy since the start of the pandemic, with many leaving the workforce to retire or take over child care needs, while others have switched professions, often to careers with better work-life balance or higher salaries. As a result, the number of open jobs has outstripped the number of workers willing or able to fill them. In August, employers reported 9.6 million job openings, an increase of 700,000 from July. That has led to higher demands being placed on the workers who remained, particularly in health care, public safety and transportation professions where there are often minimum staffing requirements.  \u201cThey can\u2019t get to kids\u2019 birthday parties; they are missing flights for vacations. It puts a strain on their relationships with their significant others as well as impacting the mental well-being of their children,\" said Nick Mutter, a Boston EMT and secretary of the Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association union. \u201cWhy is Mommy or why is Daddy not home to take me out trick-or-treating or something they promised me? Try to explain mandatory overtime to an 8-year-old.\u201d This Halloween, eight Boston EMTs were mandated to work the overnight shift at the last minute, some of whom were parents who had planned to take their kids trick-or-treating that evening, said Mutter. So far this year, EMTs in the city have worked triple the number of mandatory overtime hours that they worked in 2016, said Mutter. Employers say requiring overtime is a necessity \u2014 especially in health and safety positions with minimum staffing requirements \u2014 because they are unable to find enough workers to staff the shifts. \u201cI don\u2019t like having to rely on that,\u201d James Hooley, chief of Emergency Medical Services in Boston, said of mandatory overtime, which he said the department can only use to meet mandated minimum staffing levels. \u201cIt is something that we certainly watch, we certainly have been concerned about.\u201d The Virginia Beach Fire Department said in a statement that fire departments nationwide have been seeing a lack of interest in the profession for various reasons, including health risks, the long hours required, and a relatively low salary compared to other jobs. But several labor unions say employers should be doing more to fill the persistent vacancies, like raising wages or improving working conditions to attract new workers, rather than placing the burden on their existing employees. In some cases, labor groups say employers are using overtime as a cost-saving measure. \u201cWhat we have seen is an aggressive normalization of understaffing,\u201d said Michelle Mahon, assistant director of nursing practice for the union National Nurses United. \u201cThe hospital industry has been capitalizing on this narrative that there\u2019s a nursing shortage, when in fact there is not. There are a million nurses who are licensed to practice in this country who are not working in nursing largely because of understaffing and poor working conditions.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for Nicholas Whitehead, an operating room nurse at Ascension Via Christi Hospital in Wichita, Kansas, to have to work up to 16 hours straight, he said. After working his regular shift from 2:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., Whitehead said he is often called back to work a second shift that can last until 6:30 a.m. the following day to cover staffing shortages in the operating room. On some days, he gets just eight hours off work before heading in for his next scheduled shift. \u201cHaving that minimal or sometimes no rest, you\u2019re not able to perform to the level that would be safe or prudent for the patients,\u201d said Whitehead. \u201cCompanies would like to portray nurses as heroes, which is a nice sentiment, but we\u2019re also human beings who require rest. And because we get tired, that leads to mistakes, and in this field, those mistakes can lead to harm.\u201d Whitehead said his hospital has been using on-call duty, which was intended for emergencies or unplanned events, to make up for chronic staffing shortages in the operating room because the hospital hasn\u2019t hired enough nurses. He said he is typically called back into work twice a month because not enough nurses were scheduled for the overnight shift to cover procedures that took longer than expected or got delayed during the day. Ascension said in a statement that its operating room staff work an on-call rotation, which is considered part of the job responsibilities, and that on-call duty is intended to respond to after-hours \u201cemergent and other unscheduled surgical cases.\u201d Nursing staff across its hospital system work 10% to 15% of the time they are scheduled to be on call, the statement said. While nurses were required to work extreme hours during the pandemic, Whitehead and others say their workload hasn\u2019t gone down despite the drop-off in Covid patients. Instead, they say they are having to maintain a pandemic-era pace to make up for the thousands of nurses who have left the profession over the past several years. New York recently strengthened a law that prohibits employers from making nurses work past their regularly scheduled hours outside of an emergency or an ongoing surgical procedure. Still, Jen Burke, a nurse at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie, New York, said it has become routine for her and her colleagues working in the cardiac catheterization lab to have their 12-hour shifts extended because of a lack of staff or beds in other parts of the hospital. On one recent shift, she said nurses had to work from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. waiting for beds to open up so they could transfer their patients after their procedures were finished, leaving them just eight hours off work before they had to return for their next shift. \u201cThere\u2019s just no recognition by management that this is a problem,\u201d Burke said. \u201cYou\u2019re already working 12 hours and it\u2019s just not OK to tell somebody that they actually have to stay for another two or three hours.\u201d The hospital said in a statement that it tries to minimize how often nurses have to extend their shifts and \u201cis committed to adhering to all applicable labor laws and regulations, including those pertaining to overtime.\u201d \u201cVassar Brothers Medical Center\u2019s utmost priority is always patient safety and the delivery of high-quality care, which sometimes entails nurses extending their shifts when waiting for available beds or necessary staffing to ensure safe patient transfers,\u201d said John Nelson, a hospital spokesperson. \u201cThese instances are carefully managed to minimize their frequency and duration to prevent undue strain on our dedicated healthcare professionals.\u201d Workers say they feel like they are caught in a perpetual cycle where the required overtime is causing people to leave their jobs, exacerbating the staffing shortages and requiring even more overtime. In Boston, the police department has been around 500 officers short for the last six years, and recruiting has gotten even more difficult following the 2020 protest over the killing of George Floyd and the criticism around policing that followed, said Larry Calderone, a Boston police officer and president of the Boston Patrolmen\u2019s Association union. While Boston recently added a new class of 130 officers to its ranks, it has lost 68 so far this year, Calderone said. He said the short staffing is leading to a workload and levels of stress on officers that are \u201cindescribable.\u201d \u201cEverybody worked nonstop through Covid, but it continued for 80 or 90 hours a week, every week,\u201d said Calderone. \u201cIt continues for our police officers that are watching the homelessness situation, the mental health crisis that\u2019s going on, the physical and the sexual assaults that are happening, and they\u2019re forced to be there every day. The stress on these officers that are seeing this type of behavior, that are witnessing the emotional toll that is happening to society, I don\u2019t know how to describe it.\u201d Workers across industries say they see no end in sight. The total number of freight railway workers has shrunk by 30% since 2016 as railway companies have moved toward a new staffing model that has left fewer workers to manage the same number of tracks and an increasing amount of cargo, said Clark Ballew, a spokesperson for the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division, which represents the workers who repair and inspect railway tracks. The Association of American Railroads, which represents freight railway operators, said its members have been hiring in recent years to address staffing needs and recognize employees\u2019 desire for better scheduling. The group said the number of overtime hours worked by BMWE union members increased to 4.7 hours per week in 2022, compared to 4 hours in 2016. Cory Ludwig, who works as a machine operator repairing railway tracks in Iowa, said he\u2019s been working Saturdays and some Sundays along with 10- to 12-hour shifts since September. Recently, he worked 13 days without a day off. With the mandatory Saturday work, he\u2019s had to rely on friends and relatives to take care of his 5-year-old and 9-year-old kids. He said the overtime demands have increased as he\u2019s seen the number of workers assigned to his crew go down. \u201cYou fall asleep and then you wake up in the morning and you go right back to work. It can really break a person down, it gets really wearing on a person after a while,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cWith less people trying to do the same amount of work, working long hours, working multiple weeks in a row without one day off, you get irritated and you get burnt out.\u201d Recently, one of the union\u2019s members had been working 22 hours straight when he fell asleep on the job, an error that could have put his colleagues\u2019 lives at risk but also could have been avoided had the employee had a rest period, said Ballew. Another member was recently disciplined for refusing to work through his scheduled days off on short notice so he could care for a family member having health issues, Ballew said. \u201cThe stress it puts on marriages and parenting and the things you leave behind for your spouse to deal with or the things you miss, that kind of stress builds up,\u201d said Ballew. \u201cIn the rail industry, we have noticed recently a spate of suicides, and I can\u2019t help but think there is a correlation there.\u201d Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News digital.

        "title": "Netanyahu discusses possible hostage deal, Gaza governance and war crime allegations in interview",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday discussed a possible deal to free the hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7., Gaza\u2019s governance following the war, and death toll figures produced by Gaza officials in an interview on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Netanyahu told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that there \u201ccould be\u201d a potential hostage deal with Hamas but declined to give any further details, saying doing so could thwart the delicate negotiations to free those taken captive by the militant group. \u201cI think the less I say about it, the more I\u2019ll increase the chances that it materializes,\u201d he said in the interview. It has been just over a month since Hamas launched its terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7 in a brutal ambush that saw more than 1,200 killed and around 220 people taken hostage. In the weeks that have followed, Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza in response has seen more than 11,000 people killed, while more than 1.6 million people have been displaced, according to health officials in the besieged enclave and estimates from the United Nations. Asked by host Kristen Welker about how close Israel was to getting the hostages out, Netanyahu said that no deal had been close until his forces began the ground operation in Gaza. \u201cWe heard that there was an impending deal of this kind or of that kind and then we learned that it was all hokum. But the minute we started the ground operation that began to change,\u201d he said. Pressed again by Welker on whether there is a potential deal to release more hostages, Netanyahu replied: \u201cThere could be.\u201d Any deal, was \u201cthe result of pressure, military pressure,\u201d he said, before praising the work of the Israel Defense Forces. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that might create a deal and if a deal is available. Well, we will talk about it when it\u2019s there. We\u2019ll announce it if it\u2019s achievable,\u201d he said. Asked if he knew where all the hostages were being held right now, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe know a great deal, but I won\u2019t go beyond that.\u201d A Biden administration official confirmed to NBC News on Sunday that a possible deal for the release of hostages was being discussed. This would see the release of about 80 women and children in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and teenagers held by Israel, the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. They added that the U.S. is also exploring other options and there is no certainty that any of them will succeed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog told NBC News last week that the country has not received a substantial offer from Hamas on a deal to secure the freedom of more than 200 hostages being held in the Gaza Strip, denying reports that a deal is within reach. \u201cThere is no real proposal that is viable from Hamas\u2019 side on this issue. Whilst there are many, many people who are third parties who are sending optimistic messages to the news reels, I\u2019m saying outright: According to my knowledge, up to now, there is no real substantial information that is showing any real offer of any process on the table,\u201d Herzog, Israel\u2018s head of state, said in an interview in his office in Jerusalem. Herzog does not make policy but is briefed on Israeli intelligence and on political decisions. Netanyahu\u2019s government makes the decisions surrounding policy. Netanyahu said that a \u201cdifferent authority\u201d must govern Gaza, but he declined to say if he would accept an international force to control the region once the war with Hamas is over. The U.S. has said it would oppose an Israeli postwar occupation of Gaza. Pressed to clarify what he meant by his call for a \u201cdifferent\u201d administration to govern Gaza, Netanyahu said: \u201cI think it's too early to say.\u201d Hamas, a militant Palestinian nationalist movement, took control of Gaza \u2014 a narrow strip of land wedged between Israel and Egypt on the Mediterranean Sea that is roughly the size of Washington, D.C. \u2014 after it gained control by winning an election there in 2006. However Israel has kept a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007, despite demands from the United Nations and human rights groups to lift it due the devastating impact it has had on Palestinian civilians. Israel has said the blockade, which allows it to control Gaza\u2019s borders and is also enforced by Egypt, is needed to protect Israeli citizens from Hamas. While Netanyahu has maintained that Israel would be in charge of security over the region, he has not laid out a plan of governance after the war. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk last week accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes. Asked on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d how many civilians have been killed since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Netanyahu disputed the death toll numbers by Gaza officials, whom he called \u201cHamas officials,\u201d and blamed Hamas for civilian deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s lower than theirs,\u201d he said, before claiming that Israel has seen \u201ca steady decline\u201d in the number of civilian deaths as its ground operation in Gaza proceeds because \u201cpeople understand that they have to clear the way, and they leave.\u201d \u201cAnd remember, our goal, and we\u2019re taking extraordinary efforts to achieve it, is to minimize civilian casualties. This is our ethos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to minimize civilian casualties, but you have to do everything in your power to lay the blame for the civilian casualties on where it belongs, on Hamas.\u201d While demanding an immediate cease-fire and the release of hostages, T\u00fcrk said Hamas has committed war crimes by holding people captive and Israel has committed war crimes related to its \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of Palestinian civilians. T\u00fcrk told reporters on the Egyptian side of Gaza\u2019s Rafah border crossing last week that \u201ceven in the context of a 56-year-old occupation, the current situation is the most dangerous in decades, faced by people in Gaza, in Israel, in the West Bank but also regionally.\u201d \u201cThe international community needs to be part of finding a just and equitable future for the Palestinian and Israeli people,\u201d he added. As the death toll mounts, protesters have rallied around the world, including in the United States, to call for a cease-fire that would bring an end to Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza. The Biden administration supports a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in the conflict but has not yet called for a cease-fire. Asked by reporters last week on the chances of a Gaza cease-fire, President Joe Biden said: \u201cNone, no possibility.\u201d Israel has maintained that it will not agree to any cease-fire without the release of hostages. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that \u201cfar too many\u201d Palestinians have died and suffered in the Gaza Strip. Speaking to reporters in India\u2019s capital New Delhi as he wrapped up an intense nine-day diplomatic tour of the Middle East and Asia, he said: \u201cMuch more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them.\u201d \u201cFar too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them,\u201d he said. Netanyahu told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his country offered fuel to Gaza\u2019s Al-Shifa hospital last night, but it was \u201crefused.\u201d \u201cWe offered actually, last night, to give them enough fuel to operate the hospital, operate the incubators and so on, because we have, obviously, no battle with patients or civilians at all,\u201d he told Welker. \u201cThey refused it,\u201d he added after he was pressed on the matter. Al-Shifa suspended operations Saturday after running out of fuel. Netanyahu\u2019s comments came after the World Health Organization said it lost communication with contacts at the embattled hospital in Gaza City. Multiple babies and five people in intensive care have died at the facility, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. But, according to Dr. Marwan Abusada, a surgeon at Al-Shifa hospital, Israel\u2019s offer of fuel was only around 2% of what the hospital needed to run in a single day. The IDF said it had left 300 liters of fuel outside the hospital, but it said Hamas prevented hospital staff from accepting the fuel. Abusada, who is also the head of international cooperation at the Gaza Ministry of Health, confirmed that the hospital was offered 200 liters of fuel, but said it was not enough \u2014 that at least 10,000 liters per day would be needed to run vital parts of the hospital. \u201cIt was just 200 liters,\u201d Abusada said in a call Sunday. \u201cWhat to do with 200 liters?\u201d It\u2019s unclear why the IDF said it offered 300 liters and Abusada said the hospital was offered only 200.

        "title": "As Biden and Xi gear up for a high-stakes meeting, experts have low expectations",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S.-China relations, marred in the past year by a series of inflection points, have reached one of the tensest periods perhaps since 1972, when then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to China paved the way for diplomatic relations. A Chinese spy balloon. Close encounters in both the air and the Taiwan Strait. Diplomatic spats over the theft of technology, hacking and trade. A drought of military-to-military talks. Even the lapse of a panda agreement. All point to worsening relations that will hang over next week\u2019s meeting between President Joe Biden and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, their first in-person meeting in about a year, and the first time since 2017 that Xi has stepped foot on American soil. But experts and U.S. officials caution not to expect markedly improved relations post-meeting. \u201cWe should probably keep a pretty low bar in terms of tangible outcomes and deliverables,\u201d said Colleen Cottle, deputy director of the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThis is a meeting that\u2019s probably much more about symbolism and showing a commitment among both leaders to maintain high-level communications and keep communications flowing over the course of the next year.\u201d Senior U.S. administration officials detailed a handful of agenda items during a briefing with reporters. The leaders are expected to discuss hot-button issues including military communications, human rights and the South China Sea, an official said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a long list of outcomes or deliverables,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters. \u201cThe goals here really are about managing the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict and ensuring channels of communication are open.\u201d Neither the U.S. nor China appears to be gearing up for a significantly positive swing in relations, experts said. \u201cI think the administration here is quite clear and sober about the likely outcomes of the meeting,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies during the think tank\u2019s press briefing. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working hard to lower expectations. I think you\u2019re seeing something similar on the Chinese side.\u201d Despite low expectations, the meeting could pave the way for future discussions about solutions to issues that impact both countries, said Thomas Fingar, a China expert at Stanford University and former chairman of the National Intelligence Council. He cautioned against the idea that a summit\u2019s purpose is to solve some \u201ccritical, otherwise insoluble problem. It doesn\u2019t work that way very often.\u201d He explained that in China\u2019s political system, lower-level officials often need explicit clearance from the top. \u201cFor there really to be movement for lower levels of the system to engage in specifics, it needs a refreshed endorsement from Xi,\u201d Fingar said. The meeting itself, though anticipated, was not formally announced by the White House and Chinese Foreign Ministry until Friday. Even in recent days, Chinese officials were hesitant to confirm that Xi would attend the meeting with Biden. In a press briefing on Wednesday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said it \u201cwon\u2019t be plain sailing to San Francisco, nor can we leave it to autopilot to get us there.\u201d Similarly, when White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during a briefing on Wednesday whether the meeting was \u201clocked in,\u201d she said, \u201cI just don\u2019t have anything confirmed.\u201d When announcing the meeting, Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the leaders would discuss \u201cissues in the U.S.-PRC bilateral relationship, the continued importance of maintaining open lines of communication, and a range of regional and global issues,\u201d using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any indication that things are going to improve between the two sides,\u201d said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute. She added that neither country is willing to make \u201cany significant concessions\u201d or policy changes \u201cthat would be necessary to put the relationship on a different track.\u201d There are potential areas to move the needle on U.S.-China relations, experts say. NBC News also previously reported that the U.S. is hoping to announce a commitment from China to cut down on fentanyl coming into the U.S., as well as improve military communications. Military-to-military communications are intended to cut down on the risk of unintended conflict. It comes at a time when a historic number of U.S. warplanes have been intercepted by China. There were more than 180 incidents of Chinese aircraft intercepting U.S. planes since the fall of 2021, said Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, in a Defense Department release. Ratner said that is higher than the number of incidents that took place the decade before that. An interception has been deadly in the past. In 2001, a U.S. military plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea, killing the Chinese pilot. The Chinese government held the American crew for over a week. \u201cWe\u2019ve raised the importance of (military-to-military) channels in nearly every conversation we\u2019ve had with the Chinese,\u201d a senior administration official said in the press briefing. \u201cThis is absolutely critical. And when we\u2019re talking about managing risks, about avoiding conflict, this is exactly the sort of communication we need to be having both at senior levels of our two militaries, but also operator to operator.\u201d The Biden-Xi meeting comes just weeks after China announced that Li Shangfu would no longer serve as defense minister. Li has been sanctioned by the U.S., and experts say his removal could open the door to better relations on military communication. A defense minister who has not been sanctioned by the U.S. could make it easier to resume military-to-military talks, said David Sacks, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. The Chinese position during Li\u2019s tenure had been, \u201cWhy would he talk if he\u2019s under U.S. sanctions? Remove the sanctions, and then we can have a dialogue,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cAnd so now, presumably his successor will not be under those sanctions, and therefore you don\u2019t have that impediment towards resuming mil-mil dialogue.\u201d Biden and Xi\u2019s meeting also comes in the lead-up to Taiwan\u2019s 2024 presidential election in January, followed by the U.S. election. Taiwan is a self-ruling democracy that China claims as its own. U.S. policy maintains that Washington does not support Taiwan\u2019s independence, though there is a policy of strategic ambiguity over how the U.S. would respond if China were to invade the island. Experts say that during the meeting Biden may warn Xi against interfering in Taiwan\u2019s election, \u201calso to give whoever the winner of the election is an opportunity to put forward a proposal for cross-strait dialogue,\u201d Sacks said. When a senior administration official was asked during the briefing about how the Taiwanese election may come up in the Biden-Xi meeting, the officials emphasized U.S. opposition to any potential Chinese interference. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear publicly and privately that interference in the Taiwan election is something we\u2019re extremely concerned about,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cAnd of course, we\u2019ll plan on delivering that message again.\u201d Megan Lebowitz is based in the Washington bureau. She has written about breaking politics news and U.S.-China relations. ",

        "title": "Biden shifts into campaign mode with more attacks on Trump",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden is shifting more into campaign mode, with plans to increasingly attack his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, after some of his allies have urged him to do so in recent days, according to five people familiar with the matter. Biden personally made the decision to criticize Trump on more than policy during an event Thursday with the United Auto Workers, according to two of the people, after he had privately expressed dismay that union members might support his predecessor over him. He also took a punchier approach to his typical swipes at Trump during a fundraiser that same day, saying, \u201cSince I came off the sidelines to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, we haven\u2019t stopped winning.\u201d \u201cThe truth is, this guy can\u2019t get tired of losing,\u201d Biden added. The president was \u201cvery tapped in\u201d as Tuesday\u2019s election results rolled in that night and were analyzed the following morning, as one person familiar with the matter described it. Multiple people familiar with the matter said he felt buoyed by Democrats\u2019 strong showing after a string of polling that showed Biden losing to Trump in key battleground states. \u201cThe fight that he has in him is starting to come out,\u201d one Biden ally close to the White House said. It\u2019s an energy some of the president\u2019s supporters have been looking for him to show at his public events. \u201cWe\u2019d all like to see him inject some more energy into his speeches and his appearances,\u201d another Biden ally close to the White House said. One Democratic strategist said, \u201cThe path to stronger political standing is a stronger contrast message with Trump.\u201d \u201cRe-electing Biden in the abstract is not as potent of a message as re-electing President Biden against Donald Trump,\u201d the strategist said. As Biden prepared for his UAW event, he saw an opportunity to do more than just outline what he has done for union workers, one person familiar with the matter said. Already, he planned to criticize Trump over his record on manufacturing jobs \u2014 a line of attack he plans to continue, two people familiar with the matter said. But the idea of Trump peeling off his labor support after Biden joined the picket line during the UAW strike and has designated himself \u201cthe most pro-union president in history\u201d made him want to go further, these people said. \u201cWhen you were in the middle of the fight, I stood and others stood with you, shoulder to shoulder, on that picket line. My predecessor went to a nonunion shop and attacked you,\u201d Biden told the UAW audience. \u201cI hope you guys have a memory. Where I come from, it matters.\u201d A White House official said the president still doesn\u2019t plan to fully engage in campaigning against Trump until early next year. \u201cNot every day at every event, but we\u2019ll look for opportunities to do it,\u201d the official said. Biden has been talking to people outside the White House this past week who\u2019ve been telling him that he needs to start hitting Trump and hitting him hard, and not wait until next year, according to two people familiar with the conversations. \u201cYou can\u2019t have Trump out there slapping him and not hit back,\u201d said the ally, who argues the fight in Biden is starting to come out publicly. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a little ticked off. He wants to whack him back.\u201d People familiar with the planning said the president will continue to attack Trump not just on economic issues \u2014 drawing a contrast between their records in office \u2014 but also on abortion. Biden criticized Trump by name on Thursday over his abortion record. It\u2019s an issue where voters in Tuesday\u2019s elections overwhelmingly favored Democrats. \u201cThe only reason abortion is banned in America is because of Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said at a campaign fundraiser on Thursday. \u201cThe reason fundamental rights have been stripped away from the American people for the first time in history is because of Donald Trump.\u201d Carol E.

        "title": "House Republicans unveil their plan to avert a government shutdown next week",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Saturday unveiled their stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown set to begin next weekend. But with just five legislative days left until the deadline, Congress has little room for error. Just two and a half weeks into the job, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., opted to go with a two-step continuing resolution, or CR, over a more typical funding extension covering the entire federal government. The untested funding approach is aimed at appeasing far-right agitators in his GOP conference who despise CRs. The House is expected to vote as early as Tuesday to give members 72 hours to read the text of the bill, according to two people familiar with matter. The plan does not include budget cuts or aid for Israel. Under the two-step strategy \u2014 which Johnson and others have dubbed a \u201claddered CR\u201d but which others have likened to a step stool \u2014 several spending bills needed to keep the government open would be extended until Jan. 19, while the remaining bills would go on a CR until Feb. 2. GOP hard-liners had been pushing Johnson to include budget cuts as part of his two-tiered CR plan, a source involved in discussions said. One House Republican, Chip Roy of Texas, quickly voiced his opposition to the bill shortly after it was released. \u201cIt\u2019s a 100% clean. And I 100% oppose,\u201d Roy tweeted. \u201cMy opposition to the clean CR just announced by the Speaker to the @HouseGOP cannot be overstated. Funding Pelosi level spending & policies for 75 days \u2014 for future \u201cpromises.\u201d The plan is designed to avoid a messy showdown right before the holidays and buy Johnson and House Republicans more time to pass individual spending bills but also create a sense of urgency with staggered funding cliffs. But it remains to be seen whether the plan can pass the House, much less the Democratic-controlled Senate, which has dismissed the two-tiered approach. \u201cThis two-step continuing resolution is a necessary bill to place House Republicans in the best position to fight for conservative victories,\u201d Johnson said in a statement after he announced the plan. \u201cThe bill will stop the absurd holiday-season omnibus tradition of massive, loaded up spending bills introduced right before the Christmas recess.\u201d He added: \u201cSeparating out the CR from the supplemental funding debates places our conference in the best position to fight for fiscal responsibility, oversight over Ukraine aid, and meaningful policy changes at our Southern border.\u201d The laddered plan has the backing of Congress\u2019 most conservative members, including Republicans who normally never vote for stopgap bills. If Johnson could get a temporary funding bill passed with only Republican votes, it would help him notch an early win among conservatives. \u201cI like the ladder approach,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. \u201cI think if we try to pass some appropriations bills, we\u2019re doing better than we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d But Democrats in both chambers have made it abundantly clear that they hate the idea, as does the White House \u2014 all of whom want a simple extension of government funding without any gimmicks. Democrats\u2019 unified opposition to the laddered CR could mean the House will ultimately have to swallow whatever clean or relatively clean CR the Senate passes. \u201cI want a clean CR,\u201d declared Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. After the release of the plan, however, a Senate Democratic leadership aide said Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing the speaker didn\u2019t include unnecessary cuts and kept defense funding with the second group of programs.\" A source familiar with the matter added that Johnson moved in the direction of Democrats with his plan. Still, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York all but ruled out the two-tiered approach when he was pressed Thursday. \u201cA continuing resolution that is at the fiscal year 2023 levels is the only way forward, because that\u2019s the status quo,\u201d he said, advocating for a clean CR. Across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., teed up a vote on a separate stopgap measure, setting the wheels in motion for action next week. The Democratic-led Senate is eyeing a clean continuing resolution that would run through mid-January, without additional funding for Ukraine, Israel and the border, according to two sources directly involved in the process. But Schumer would most likely need a time agreement from all 100 senators to fund the government by Friday\u2019s deadline, which Senate hard-liners will be reluctant to give. \u201cI implore Speaker Johnson and our House Republican colleagues and learn from the fiasco of a month ago. Hard-right proposals, hard-right slash and cuts, hard-right poison pills that have zero support from Democrats will only make a shutdown more likely,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech. What\u2019s clear is that after last month\u2019s public GOP civil war over the speaker\u2019s gavel, Republicans have little appetite for shutting down the government. Even some hard-core conservatives, like Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said they are willing to vote for a CR to keep the government open and don\u2019t care how it\u2019s structured. \u201cI\u2019m open to supporting a CR, and if you\u2019ve been following me, that\u2019s a 180-degree turn,\u201d said Bishop, a Freedom Caucus member who is running for North Carolina attorney general. He said his wife recently asked what was happening in Congress this week. He replied: Figuring out \u201cwhat the features of the CR are going to be.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t think that Americans care that much,\u201d Bishop added.

        "title": "Trump backs requests for TV coverage of his federal criminal trial",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Donald Trump has filed a legal motion backing media requests for live television coverage of his federal trial on charges he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the late Friday filing, Trump argued that prosecutors want the trial held \u201cin darkness\u201d as part of what he claims is a politically motivated effort by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to undermine his bid for re-election next year. Trump is leading the field of Republican candidates seeking the party\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination. Biden is expected to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination to a second term. Trump is facing four criminal proceedings, including the federal court trial set for March in which he faces charges of attempting to defraud the federal government and obstructing Congress by knowingly spreading false claims of election fraud. His unfounded claims that the 2020 vote was rigged spurred thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block congressional certification of his defeat by Biden. In his latest filing by his lawyers, John Lauro and Todd Blanche, Trump endorsed requests by media organizations that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan allow live television coverage of the trial. \u201cEvery person in America, and beyond, should have the opportunity to study this case firsthand and watch as, if there is a trial, President Trump exonerates himself of these baseless and politically motivated charges,\u201d said the filing. It accused Special Prosecutor Jack Smith\u2019s team of violating Trump\u2019s constitutional rights and attacked Chutkan for allowing \u201cthese attacks,\u201d thereby \u201cplacing the interests of his political opposition\u201d above his legal protections. \u201cThese proceedings should be fully televised so that American public can see first hand that this case...is nothing more than a dreamt-up constitutional charade,\u201d it said. Smith earlier this month opposed the media requests, citing a decades-old federal court rule barring broadcasts of criminal proceedings. Television coverage also potentially could intimidate witnesses and jurors, Smith said in a Nov. 3 filing. ",

        "title": "After debate clash, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley turn back to the battle for Iowa",
        "content": "For one night this week, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley battled face-to-face in Miami. Now, they\u2019re trying to bring momentum from debate week back to Iowa \u2014 and the fight to be Donald Trump\u2019s main GOP challenger. A survey of local Republican leaders demonstrated why Haley has been on the rise in the first caucus state: They were impressed by her performance at the third GOP debate Wednesday night, as many Republicans were after the first two debates. The former United Nations ambassador has a swing through Iowa planned for next week, building on the gains that saw her tie DeSantis for second in the latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. DeSantis, who also drew credit for his debate performance, has a slate of Iowa events this weekend building off his own big news there: the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who is beloved by local Republicans and enjoys near-universal favorable ratings in the party. On Friday morning, the Florida governor announced an additional 24 local endorsements in Iowa. Trump remains dominant in Iowa with a little more than two months until the Iowa caucuses. But both DeSantis and Haley are digging into the competition for second place. \u201cI do think you\u2019ll see Nikki start rising some. You hear an awful lot of people talk about how they like to listen to her,\u201d said Boone County GOP chair Gary Nystrom, who plans to remain neutral until after the GOP caucuses. \u201cTalk is one thing, voting is another thing, but there is interest,\u201d he added. But for Matt Giese, the Republican Party chair in Dubuque County, the highest-profile endorsement in the state goes a lot farther than anything from the debate. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have the endorsement of Reynolds than the debate,\u201d Giese said, adding: \u201cPeople are gonna forget about that debate pretty quick. In my opinion, it\u2019s down to Trump or DeSantis in Iowa.\u201d According to the NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in late October, 43% of likely Republican caucusgoers pick Trump as their first-choice candidate, while 16% choose DeSantis and another 16% select Haley. Their second-place tie comes despite the Florida governor spending significantly more time and money in the Hawkeye State, while Haley has visited more rarely, at least until recently. Earlier in the campaign, said Nystrom, \u201cGov. DeSantis was the hottest subject in the state. \u2026 Then it plateaued and maybe even regressed just a little bit.\u201d For those tuning into the debates, Haley\u2019s foreign policy chops from her time at the United Nations have shone through. \u201cI think she comes off as very knowledgeable about foreign policy,\u201d said Gene Newgaard, the Hardin County GOP chair. \u201cShe\u2019s coming across as confident.\u201d But Newgaard also thinks DeSantis performed well Wednesday evening. \u201cLast night was the best performance he had,\u201d Newgaard said of the Florida governor. \u201cI\u2019ve had a number of people when I\u2019ve mentioned DeSantis\u2019 name say they like him,\u201d Newgaard continued, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t really get a feel as far as Haley goes, because she\u2019s never been in the county.\u201d Jasper County Republican Party Chair Thad Nearmyer also felt that Haley has mastered her messaging on foreign affairs, a key ingredient in her rise. \u201cShe is like head and shoulders above everybody else when that\u2019s the topic,\u201d said Nearmyer. Foreign policy has often been a fourth-tier issue for voters. Just last year, NBC News exit polling from the 2022 midterm elections showed inflation, abortion and crime were the three issues that mattered most to voters. But with the Israel-Hamas war and the war in Ukraine raging on, familiarity with the world stage may take a higher priority when Iowa Republicans decide who they want as a presidential candidate in 2024. And foreign policy questions have featured prominently in all three debates. \u201cShe has probably won all three debates,\u201d said Nearmyer. But as the Dubuque County GOP\u2019s Giese said, it\u2019s not clear how long each debate will linger in voters\u2019 minds \u2014 several of the Iowa county GOP chairs contacted by NBC News admitted they hadn\u2019t tuned in to the third debate, despite their roles in local Republican leadership in the first caucus state. Nystrom, of Boone County, noted that DeSantis\u2019 team has been on the ground in his community throughout the summer in a way that Haley\u2019s team hasn\u2019t, although he expects that to shift in the remaining months before Jan. 15. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing more of Nikki Haley now, is she\u2019s trying to do some catch-up. And I think it\u2019s working. I mean, I think she\u2019s drawing more attention. And attention is good when you\u2019re in that type of a race.\u201d DeSantis, meanwhile, is collecting \u201cmore and more\u201d local endorsements, Nystrom said. \u201cAnd it appears that they\u2019re trying to get to the grassroots more, which, in my opinion, is a smart move.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how you get elected \u2014 is get your grassroots back again,\u201d Nystrom added.

        "content": "The Republican National Committee is threatening to disqualify GOP presidential candidates from RNC-sponsored debates if they participate in an Iowa forum hosted by a conservative Christian organization. The warning comes ahead of the Family Leader Foundation's event on Friday that the group said will include White House hopefuls sitting at a table for a \u201cmoderated, friendly and open discussion.\u201d In a letter obtained by NBC News, the RNC reminded candidates that they signed a pledge not to participate in debates like the one in Des Moines that aren\u2019t sanctioned by the national party. \u201cAny Republican presidential candidate who participates in this or other similar events will be deemed to have violated this pledge and will be disqualified from taking part in any future RNC-sanctioned presidential primary debates,\u201d the Oct. 28 letter said. RealClearPolitics first reported on the letter. The Family Leader Foundation has invited Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former President Donald Trump to participate in its forum. DeSantis confirmed on Friday that he\u2019ll attend the group\u2019s event. \u201cI\u2019m going to be there at the Family Leader, I think it\u2019s an important part of this process,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here no matter what happens, and so you guys can pencil me in for that,\u201d he told reporters after a campaign event in Ames, Iowa. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Ramaswamy campaign, told NBC News in a statement that the campaign is \u201chopeful that RNC and the Family Leader will be able to work out their logistical issues to best serve the voters.\u201d Scott and Haley have not confirmed whether they plan on attending. The Family Leader is not expecting Trump to accept the invitation, a spokesperson for the group told NBC News. Bob Vander Plaats, the group\u2019s CEO, has been openly critical of Trump.

        "title": "Louisiana legislators have until Jan. 15 to enact new congressional map, court says",
        "content": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 The Louisiana Legislature has until Jan. 15 to enact a new congressional map after a lower court last year ruled that the current political boundaries dilute the power of the state\u2019s Black voters, a federal New Orleans appeals court said Friday. However, whether current Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards will call a special session to redraw the political boundaries and if Republican Gov.-elect Jeff Landry, who will be inaugurated Jan. 8, will have enough time to call a special redistricting session and meet the court\u2019s deadline has yet to be determined. If the Legislature does not pass a new map by mid-January, then the lower district court should conduct a trial and \u201cdecide on a plan for the 2024 elections,\u201d according to the order by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth District. The political tug-of-war and legal battle over Louisiana\u2019s GOP-drawn congressional map has been going on for more than a year and a half \u2014 which has included Edwards vetoing the political boundaries and the Legislature overriding his veto, the first time in nearly three decades that lawmakers refused to accept a governor\u2019s refusal of a bill they had passed. Louisiana is among states still wrangling over congressional districts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana\u2019s current map, which was used in the November congressional election, has white majorities in five of six districts \u2014 despite Black people accounting for one-third of the state\u2019s population. Republicans, who dominate Louisiana\u2019s Legislature, say that the map is fair. They argue that Black populations in the state are too dispersed to be united into a second majority Black district. Democrats argue that the map discriminates against Black voters and that there should be two majority-minority districts. Currently, five of the six districts are held by Republicans. Another mostly Black district could deliver a second congressional seat to Democrats. In June 2022, a lower court struck down Louisiana\u2019s map for violating the Voting Rights Act. U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick said in her ruling that \u201cevidence of Louisiana\u2019s long and ongoing history of voting-related discrimination weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs.\u201d Dick ordered that the map be redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, before it was appealed to the 5th Circuit. In October, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from Black voters in Louisiana to speed the process of drawing new congressional districts in the state. Lawmakers now have until mid-January to draw and pass a new map, which would have to be done through a special session. A special session may be called by the governor or convened by the presiding officers of both chambers, upon a written petition of most elected members of the House and Senate. While Edwards has not said whether he will call a special session, he remains adamant that a second majority-Black district is necessary to accurately represent the state. \u201cThis is about simple math, basic fairness, and the rule of law,\u201d Edwards said in a written statement. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, the state\u2019s sole Black and Democratic member of Congress, said he \u201csincerely\u201d hopes the Legislature will draw a new map with a second majority-Black district. Carter posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to urge lawmakers to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and that \u201cthere is no need to wait for a court to force compliance with clear law.\u201d If Gov.-elect Landry calls a special session, the timing will be tricky \u2014 as Landry won\u2019t be inaugurated until Jan. 8 and the session couldn\u2019t start until seven days after the proclamation is issued, meaning the earliest lawmakers could return to the Capitol is the Jan. 15 deadline. Landry could not be reached for comment. However, in the appeals court\u2019s order it does say that the district court will have discretion to grant \u201climited additional time\u201d if requested.

        "content": "Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Friday lowered its ratings outlook on the United States\u2019 government to negative from stable, pointing to rising risks to the nation\u2019s fiscal strength. The ratings agency has affirmed the long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings of the U.S. at Aaa. \u201cIn the context of higher interest rates, without effective fiscal policy measures to reduce government spending or increase revenues,\u201d the agency said. \u201cMoody\u2019s expects that the US\u2019 fiscal deficits will remain very large, significantly weakening debt affordability.\u201d Brinkmanship in Washington has also been a contributing factor, Moody\u2019s said. \u201cContinued political polarization within US Congress raises the risk that successive governments will not be able to reach consensus on a fiscal plan to slow the decline in debt affordability,\u201d the ratings agency said. As far as keeping the nation\u2019s ratings at Aaa, Moody\u2019s said that it expects the U.S. to \u201cretain its exceptional economic strength.\u201d \u201cFurther positive growth surprises over the medium term could at least slow the deterioration in debt affordability,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWhile the statement by Moody\u2019s maintains the United States\u2019 Aaa rating, we disagree with the shift to a negative outlook,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo in a statement. \u201cThe American economy remains strong, and Treasury securities are the world\u2019s preeminent safe and liquid asset.\u201d Moody\u2019s move to cut its outlook arrives as Congress faces the looming threat of a government shutdown once more. For now, the government is funded through Nov. 17, but lawmakers in Washington remain at loggerheads over a bill ahead of the deadline. Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has indicated that he will release a Republican government funding plan on Saturday, a move that would permit members time to read it before an expected Tuesday vote on the measure. But his plan to fund certain parts of the government through Dec. 7, and other parts through Jan. 19, known as a laddered continuing resolution, or CR, is dead on arrival in the White House and in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cMoody\u2019s decision to change the U.S. outlook is yet another consequence of Congressional Republican extremism and dysfunction,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Back in August, Fitch cut the U.S. long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA, citing \u201cexpected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,\u201d as well as an erosion of governance and a growing debt burden. Feuding in Washington was also an issue. \u201cThe repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,\u201d Fitch said at the time.

        "content": "FBI agents this week seized phones and an iPad from New York City Mayor Eric Adams amid an ongoing investigation into his campaign fundraising, a lawyer for the mayor said Friday. Agents approached Adams after an event Monday night and requested his devices, Boyd Johnson, a lawyer for the mayor's campaign organization, said in a statement. \"The mayor has been and remains committed to cooperating in this matter,\" Johnsons said. \"The mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing and continues to cooperate with the investigation.\" A source familiar with the matter said the mayor handed over two cellphones and an iPad after the event and later turned over additional electronic devices. News of the mayor\u2019s devices being seized was first reported by The New York Times. A spokesperson for the FBI's New York City press office declined to comment. On Nov. 2, the FBI searched the New York home of a campaign fundraiser for Adams. The search was part of a federal campaign finance investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. That search prompted the mayor to cancel a planned trip to meet with White House officials in Washington and instead return to New York. \"As a former member of law enforcement, I expect all members of my staff to follow the law and fully cooperate with any sort of investigation \u2014 and I will continue to do exactly that,\" Adams said in a statement on Friday. \"I have nothing to hide.\" The mayor's team said it alerted authorities involved in the federal investigation to someone who \"acted improperly.\" This was done \"in the spirit of transparency and cooperation,\" the lawyer said. During a news conference earlier this week, Adams expressed confidence in his campaign organization. \"I would be shocked if someone states that our campaign coordinated in illegal behavior,\" he said. News of the mayor's devices being seized was first reported by the New York Times. NBC New York reported earlier this month that Adams, who was not yet halfway through his first term as mayor, had raised more than $2 million for his re-election campaign. Adams, who retired from the New York Police Department at the rank of captain, campaigned as a tough-on-crime Democrat who would increase NYPD staffing and funding. In July, six people were charged and accused in an alleged scheme to divert tens of thousands of dollars to Adams\u2019 campaign through straw donors, or people whose names were used to subvert individual donation limits. Two pleaded guilty. The allegations, filed in state court, did not implicate the mayor, and his representatives have said he did not have knowledge of the alleged scheme.

        "content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris flew to South Carolina on Friday to file paperwork putting President Joe Biden on the 2024 presidential ballot of the state, which will lead off the Democratic presidential primary thanks to a White House-led schedule overhaul meant to better empower Black voters. Harris was joined in the state capital by South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, one of the leading Black voices in Congress. Then-candidate Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign was floundering after big losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, but rebounded with a decisive South Carolina win that was solidified by Clyburn\u2019s late endorsement. That 2020 boost gave Biden enough momentum to romp through Super Tuesday, clinch his party\u2019s primary and later the White House. Since announcing his re-election bid in April, Biden has made far more frequent official visits to Pennsylvania \u2014 a key battleground in the general election \u2014 than states that will decide Democrats\u2019 2024 primary. But Harris\u2019 visit follows the vice president spending recent months traveling the country, including a college tour that has taken her to leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities. She\u2019s looking to build excitement among young people and voters of color at a time when polls show that even a majority of Democrats, believe Biden is too old to handle the rigors of a second term. \u201cIt was South Carolina that created the path to the White House for Joe Biden and me,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019m here to say thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d Iowa\u2019s 2020 caucus was marred by technical glitches, and Biden asked last year that the Democratic National Party replace it in the leadoff spot with South Carolina. He said Black and other minority voters need to play a larger, earlier role in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. The DNC approved a new 2024 calendar where South Carolina\u2019s primary on Feb. 3 will be followed three days later by Nevada. The schedule also moves Michigan into the group of early states voting before Super Tuesday on March 5, when most of the rest of the country holds primaries. DNC chair Jaime Harrison joined Clyburn at the airport for Harris\u2019 arrival in Columbia. \u201cThe Biden-Harris coalition will be out in full force in South Carolina and will be how we defeat MAGA extremism once again in 2024,\u201d Biden reelection campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said in a statement, referring to former President Donald Trump, who has built a commanding early lead in next year\u2019s Republican presidential primary, and his \u201dMake American Great Again\u201d slogan. Harris spoke in a crowded room at state party headquarters, flanked by cheering supporters holding Biden-Harris and South Carolina Democratic Party signs. Asked to predict how Biden would do in February\u2019s primary, Harris responded, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d Referring to this week\u2019s elections, when Democrats won in key races across the country, Harris said, \u201cWe are here with the wind at our back, because, did anyone notice what happened on Tuesday?\u201d She turned the Biden campaign papers over to Christale Spain, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party who said, \u201cI am proud of the role that the Palmetto State played in ensuring that they would go on to win the White House, and I am completely honored to accept their filing today.\u201d Clyburn held up a brochure of the Biden administration\u2019s accomplishments and highlighted efforts to reduce student loan debt around the country \u2014 efforts that have been limited by court challenges. He told the crowd of the vice president, \u201cFor her to come back here today and be a part of this says a whole lot.\u201d \u201cThis is really, really an incredible demonstration of what South Carolina is all about,\u201d Clyburn said. Later, he and Harris stopped by the Vietnam War Memorial in downtown Columbia to help mark Veterans Day. Republicans are leading off their 2024 primary with the Iowa caucus on Jan. 15, and the state\u2019s Democrats will caucus then, too, but not release the presidential results immediately to comply with party rules. New Hampshire, however, has rejected the new calendar and is planning to hold its primary in January, arguing that it has held the nation\u2019s first primary for more than a century, a rule that Iowa was able to circumvent only because it had a caucus. Biden won\u2019t appear on the New Hampshire ballot and isn\u2019t planning to campaign there, though some of the state\u2019s top Democrats are organizing a write-in campaign backing his reelection bid. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the only elected Democrat to challenge Biden in 2024, has already filed to appear on both the New Hampshire and South Carolina ballots. ",

        "title": "Tennessee man admits to conspiring with Jan. 6 defendant to kill FBI agents",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 An associate of a Jan. 6 defendant pleaded guilty this week to charges that the two men plotted \u201cto murder employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d Austin Carter, who was a 26-year-old security officer and a member of the Army Reserves at the time of his arrest in December 2022, admitted in a plea agreement that he \u201cunlawfully and knowingly combined, conspired, and agreed with his co-defendant,\u201d Edward Kelley, to kill FBI personnel. Carter admitted that he provided a cooperating witness \u201cwith a list of FBI employees that CARTER received from KELLEY\u201d on or about Dec. 13, 2022, and that Carter instructed the cooperating witness \u201cto memorize the FBI employees identified on the list and then burn the list.\u201d Kelley and Carter \u201cdiscussed plans to attack the FBI Field Office in Knoxville, Tennessee\u201d and that the purpose of the conspiracy was \u201cto retaliate against government conduct,\u201d Carter admitted. A court filing from December said that the list Kelley provided included about 37 names of law enforcement personnel who worked on Kelley\u2019s Jan. 6 case, and identified which officers were present when Kelley was arrested. Kelley, an anti-abortion activist, was initially arrested in May 2022 after he was identified as one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6. Video from the Jan. 6 riot shows a man identified as Kelley using a piece of wood to breach a window, jumping through the window, and then kicking open a fire escape, allowing other rioters to stream inside the Capitol. Kelley and Carter were arrested in connection with the alleged murder plot last December. A jury trial for Kelley in the federal murder conspiracy case is scheduled for January, while a status conference in his Jan. 6 case is set for December. Carter and prosecutors agreed this week that \u201ca sentence not greater than 120 months in prison is the appropriate disposition of this case.\u201d A detention memo from after Carter's arrest noted that he \u201cworked for four different security companies and is a member of the Army Reserves, where he received advanced training.\u201d About 1,200 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and an additional 1,000 suspects have been identified but not yet charged. The statute of limitations on most of the crimes committed on Jan. 6 expires in a bit over two years, in early 2026. Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "How one election official is trying to stop 2024 conspiracy theories before they start",
        "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 Operating a swing-state election office in 2023 requires not just attention to detail, but also fortitude \u2014 and in the case of Maricopa County, Arizona, Recorder Stephen Richer, an enormous amount of caffeine. \u201cYes, I am a Diet Coke addict \u2014 a living, walking experiment,\u201d he told NBC News.  \u201cI probably drink north of 100 ounces every single day.\u201d There have been a lot of long days for Richer since he took over a key election post in Arizona\u2019s largest county \u2014 and the biggest swing-state county in the nation \u2014 at the start of 2021, thanks in part to online harassment, physical threats and a nonstop stream of baseless conspiracy theories about Maricopa County\u2019s 2020 election results. But he has also poured countless hours into improving both the efficiency and transparency around his vote counting operation, with the hopes of restoring trust in Arizona\u2019s elections and preventing the next set of conspiracies from taking root. Richer, 38, says faster vote counting will produce more-trusted vote counting. \u201cKnowing the results within a certain period is something that can help boost confidence,\u201d he said, drawing a straight line from Arizona\u2019s long 2020 and 2022 counts to dozens of conspiracy theories that permeated the electorate afterward. State law prohibits Arizona election officials from processing mail ballots dropped off on Election Day until after the polls close that day, and hundreds of thousands of Arizonans vote that way each year. Those ballots cannot be fed straight into tabulators, as the signatures on their envelopes must first be verified by election workers. It\u2019s a much more drawn-out process than the simple tabulation of ballots cast at the polls on Election Day. Richer has proposed a series of reforms ahead of the 2024 election \u2014 ranging from what many consider common-sense to more controversial proposals.  Most of the ideas were developed with the intention of projecting Arizona\u2019s election winners faster.  But his ideas could speed up election projections in other states with slow-counting reputations, too. Three of Richer\u2019s proposals that could drastically speed up vote tabulations: Ending the practice of allowing Election Day drop-off of mail ballots; allowing officials to process mail ballots faster; and being more aggressive about disqualifying ballots on which voters may have made minor mistakes. Right now, election workers try to adjudicate their intent \u2014 and voters have a window of opportunity after the election to \u201ccure\u201d the ballot, too. \u201cI would just like to reconfigure the system such that we\u2019re able to have a higher percentage within the first 24 hours,\u201d he said of Maricopa\u2019s vote totals, which typically represent more than 60% of all ballots cast in the state. Even though Richer says Arizona counts ballots faster than most other Western states, it remains a perfect storm for a long-drawn-out election week. Approximately 90% of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail, and almost 20% of that group uses the Election Day drop-off option that slows down the tabulation process. Add in that Arizona consistently has some of the closest statewide elections in the entire country, and it\u2019s a recipe for a long and uncertain post-election wait for observers. \u201cUtah is an all-mail state; California is an all-mail state \u2026 [but] I can tell you right now who\u2019s going to win in Utah and California: the Republican in Utah; the Democrat in California,\u201d Richer said. NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona\u2019s 2022 or 2020 Senate races until three days after the polls closed.  In 2018, it took six days for the network to project a winner. Richer didn\u2019t get much cooperation from the Arizona Legislature this year \u2014 conspiracy-promoting Republicans in the Legislature have been at war for years now with him and other Republican Maricopa County officials who defend the county\u2019s elections.  Instead, Richer has tried to speed up Maricopa County\u2019s reporting process \u2014 and increase opportunities for the public to monitor it \u2014 from the inside without rule changes. New windows and cameras have been installed for observers to watch ballot tabulation, adjudication and storage, and excess wiring has been removed so observers can see no tabulation device is connected to the internet. Richer has also had new security boxes installed around computer towers so no USB devices can be plugged in. And on top of that, new security cages and keypads have been installed so logs are recorded anytime anyone accesses sensitive equipment or materials. Maricopa County also significantly fortified security measures around its facilities, even before a series of suspicious letters, including one that tested positive for fentanyl, were sent to other election officials around the country last week \u2014 a threat the FBI is investigating. Richer has also encouraged observers to livestream multiple security camera views of Maricopa County\u2019s election center and drop box locations. \u201cI believe that we have contributed in a positive way to the conversation about American democracy, which Arizona has had an outsized role,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting.\u201d Richer has also floated one long shot idea he thinks could improve elections: slow the rest of the country\u2019s reporting down to Arizona\u2019s speed. In this scenario, \u201cnobody releases results until maybe five days after Election Day,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause a lot of states have a lot of different policies.\u201d Richer admitted the idea stood no chance of happening anytime soon. \u201cMy real goal here: let\u2019s at least have a conversation.\u201d Noah Pransky is a senior political correspondent for NBC News & NBC Owned Television Stations, based in New York City.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Georgia man was arrested on charges of threatening to kill Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia confirmed to NBC News on Friday. Sean Patrick Cirillo, of Macon, has been charged with using his phone to threaten Greene, R-Ga., and her staff. The news was first reported by CNN. According to senior law enforcement sources, Cirillo allegedly called Greene\u2019s office twice on Wednesday, threatening to kill her. Cirillo was arrested by the FBI and is behind bars, pending his first appearance in federal court on Monday. In a recording of a call shared by Greene\u2019s office with NBC News, the caller said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen when you are out of power?\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t think you are going to get payback?\u201d Greene thanked law enforcement in a statement on Friday, saying they \"acted swiftly in response to this murderous threat.\" \"From Rome City Police, the Floyd County Sheriff\u2019s Office, U.S. Capitol Police, the House Sergeant at Arms, and ultimately the FBI who made the arrest, every official acted quickly to put this man behind bars,\" Greene said. \"Threats to murder elected officials should never be tolerated,\" no matter their political affiliation, she said. \"I\u2019m not the only victim with this threat of violence. My family is threatened. My staff is threatened. I even had to close my district office due to the potential of violence. It\u2019s wrong and never should happen.\" Greene added: \"Threats of violence must be taken seriously. And that\u2019s exactly why I take my Second Amendment rights seriously.\" It was not immediately clear what prompted the alleged threats targeting her and members of her family. The conservative congresswoman has recently been in the news because of her censure resolutions against Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and for filing articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

        "title": "Americans are unusually down on a solid economy. So far, they aren't spending \u2014 or voting \u2014 like it.",
        "content": "By just about any measure, the mighty American economy is chugging along nicely. The much-forecast recession of 2023 simply never happened. Instead, the jobless rate has remained below 4% for two years, wages are finally rising faster than inflation, and the economy revved up in the third quarter to post a nearly 5% growth. Bipartisan investments in infrastructure and computer chip manufacturing are just starting to bear fruit, fueling more economic tailwinds in the months ahead. In fact, in a note to clients Wednesday, Goldman Sachs declared \u201cthe hard part is over\u201d for efforts to shore up the global economy, predicting that inflation would continue to ease in 2024. The bank\u2019s researchers now expect a mere 15% risk that the United States will tip into a recession next year, following a spate of forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, voicing growing economic optimism. But many Americans don\u2019t share that view. Consumer sentiment dropped to a six-month low this month, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. A new Bankrate survey found half of Americans saying their overall financial situation is worse now than on Election Day 2020. And a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found 81% of voters rating the economy either \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d with just 19% calling it \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d Republican presidential candidates who debated in Miami Wednesday night looked to reinforce these views, making the case \u2014 sometimes by misrepresenting how gas prices and wages have trended \u2014 that the economy isn\u2019t working well with a Democrat in the White House. Yet despite the widespread pessimism, consumers \u2014 who drive two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 are still spending. \u201cPeople may be feeling bad, but they are not spending badly,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist of the payroll processing firm ADP. \u201cThey are spending like they are optimistic, even though they are reporting that they are pessimistic.\u201d What gives? The likely explanation is a gloomy soup of two major wars, ongoing domestic political divisions, a still-recent pandemic and price pressures that have slowed down dramatically but rarely reversed. \u201cIt\u2019s one word: inflation,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. In his view, inflation\u2019s lingering toll over the past year and a half more than makes up for the historic strength in the job market and other upsides to Americans\u2019 wallets. \u201cInflation is coming down, but prices aren\u2019t coming down, which is the source of the irritation\u201d for many, Hamrick said. And of course, the country\u2019s yawning economic inequality means that robust overall consumer spending figures can\u2019t help but mask wide disparities in households\u2019 finances. (\u201cThere\u2019s no one, monolithic \u2018consumer,\u2019\u201d Hamrick noted.) Inflation has eased from the painful 9.1% in the middle of last year to 3.7% in September. But while economists and Fed officials are cheered by that trend, ordinary Americans vividly recall a not-so-distant past when many things were cheaper. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk in November 2019 was $3.19. It surged to $4.20 in May 2022, before settling back to $3.97 this fall. \u201cWe\u2019re in an economy where the price level has taken a big, gigantic step up,\u201d said Richardson. Add in the highest interest rates in decades and borrowing money is more expensive, too \u2014 translating to steeper mortgage rates and credit card interest. A year out from the 2024 vote, it\u2019s an open question how, or even whether, Americans\u2019 economic malaise will play out either in the economy itself or at the ballot box. But both parties have been betting heavily that it will matter. President Joe Biden has been pounding the pavement to trumpet $5 billion in new investments to juice rural economies, hoping that voters will reward him and fellow Democrats for infrastructure projects ramping up across the country. Meanwhile, Republicans have raced to pin voters\u2019 frustrations over high prices on \u201cBidenomics,\u201d the term that the White House has used to try \u2014 with uncertain success \u2014 to brand the administration\u2019s economic policies. Of course, presidents frequently get too much credit and too much blame for the state of the economy on their watches, and pollsters note that voters tend to blame a leader for a declining economy more than they will credit for a good one. But if Tuesday\u2019s election results are any indication, there\u2019s no guarantee that next year\u2019s contest will hinge on the economy. In a number of races \u2014 albeit off-year ones that tend to draw a different mix of voters than those who turn out for presidential elections \u2014 other issues rose to the fore. Abortion access in particular has continued to propel Democrats to victories at the state and local level after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. In many cases, conservative voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, including for his handling of the economy, crossed party lines to back more expansive reproductive rights. If the past 12 months\u2019 mistaken economic predictions have illustrated anything, it\u2019s that a lot can change in a year, both in Americans\u2019 financial lives and the ways they feel about them. Reflecting on the dissonance between many of the economy\u2019s fundamentals and consumers\u2019 sour outlook, Richardson was circumspect. \u201cWhen that feeling starts translating into behavior,\u201d she said, \u201cI think that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to have to pay attention.\u201d Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News.

        "title": "Judge in classified documents case rejects Trump's request to delay May trial date",
        "content": "A federal judge on Friday declined former President Donald Trump\u2019s request to postpone the May start date of the trial in the special counsel\u2019s classified documents case. In a new court filing Friday, Judge Aileen Cannon left open the possibility of pushing back the trial date at a later date, saying she will consider the issue when the parties meet for a March 1 scheduling conference. The decision deals a short-term blow to Trump, who had sought to push the trial back amid the cascading demands of his civil and criminal cases in New York, Florida and Washington, D.C. Yet Cannon acknowledged \u201can unusually high volume\u201d of unclassified and classified discovery and the challenge of accessing certain materials, a point that Trump\u2019s defense has argued as they press for more time. Due process requires more time for the defendants to review the materials, Cannon said. The judge pushed several pretrial deadlines as the two sides negotiate the handling of classified discovery in the case. Cannon had paused pretrial litigation on the use of some classified materials as she weighed the request from Trump over the timing of the trial. The defense had asked for an extension of several months, citing delays in accessing legal materials for the case.  Trump\u2019s attorneys had also asked Cannon to consider their request that the trial take place after the 2024 election. The judge overseeing a separate case into Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to hold on to power after the 2020 election denied a similar request by his defense to postpone a trial. Cannon had announced in July that the trial would begin May 20 in Fort Pierce, Florida. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign, Steven Cheung, cast the ruling as a victory, writing in a statement, \u201cWe look forward to the conference set by Judge Cannon for next March, where future scheduling matters, including a potential trial date, will be discussed.\u201d \u201cThe concerted effort by the Biden Administration to deny President Trump\u2019s constitutional rights to prepare for trial reveal their corrupt motives,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cIt is clearly in the best interest of Justice for President Trump to have adequate time to prepare and file motions as he works to defeat these hoaxes and marches back to the White House.\u201d Trump, the Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race, faces several criminal and civil cases and has argued for delaying the trial in Florida because of the conflicting scheduling demands. Cannon heard arguments last week on the effort to delay the trial in Fort Pierce, roughly 65 miles from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property, where he allegedly held on to classified materials, shared them and instructed some employees to dodge the government\u2019s efforts to retrieve them, according to the special counsel\u2019s indictment. An attorney for Trump participated remotely from New York, where he is representing the former president in an ongoing fraud trial. Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2020, had earlier sided with the defense after prosecutors raised concerns over the fact that some attorneys had represented a swath of Trump employees and allies and were paid by a political action committee affiliated with the former president. These aides include Trump\u2019s co-defendants in the case and employees who could become potential witnesses in the trial, raising the prospect that they could testify against the attorney\u2019s other clients. Attorneys for the government said this represented a conflict of interest. Special counsel Jack Smith charged Trump with mishandling classified documents after he left office, alongside two employees at Mar-a-Lago. The former president has pleaded not guilty to the 40-count indictment. The employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have also pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.

        "content": "A former New Jersey National Guard police sergeant accused of pepper-spraying officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack turned himself in to authorities in New Jersey on Friday following a 48-hour manhunt. Gregory Yetman faces several charges, including felonies such as assaulting officers and obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder, as well as some misdemeanor offenses, according to the FBI. Yetman was taken into custody after the FBI on Thursday announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Amy Thoreson, a spokeswoman for the FBI\u2019s Newark office, said that he turned himself in to the Monroe Township Police on Friday morning without incident, adding: \u201cWe want to thank the public for all the tips and calls we received.\u201d A senior law enforcement official told NBC News that Yetman was dirty and unkept when he turned himself in, and that he declined medical attention. Registered weapons were found at his home, the official said. They believe he may have had a plan to flee, since he had previously been questioned about the Jan. 6 attack. Yetman had fled into a wooded area with railroad tracks near his home in the township of Helmetta on Wednesday, before he surrendered himself to authorities in the area. Jan. 6 suspects have typically been allowed pretrial release, except in circumstances where authorities had evidence that they posed a threat to the public or were a flight risk. Because Yetman fled, it is likely that prosecutors will seek pretrial detention, although there were no court filings regarding his case as of Friday morning. Courts were closed for a federal holiday, and Yetman is expected to make his first court appearance in New Jersey on Monday. Yetman was identified in early 2022 by online sleuths who go by the name \u201cSedition Hunters,\u201d a group that has aided in the arrests of hundreds of Capitol rioters. The online sleuths said Yetman was seen unloading a canister of a chemical weapon from behind a police line as officers came under attack on Jan. 6, 2021. That image of Yetman was featured in a wanted poster released by the FBI on Thursday, before he surrendered. About 1,200 defendants have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack, and another roughly 1,000 suspects have been identified but not yet arrested. Ryan J.

        "title": "Biden and China's Xi to discuss competition and limiting conflict at meeting next week",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in the San Francisco Bay area, the White House announced on Friday. Biden will meet with Xi next Wednesday to \u201cdiscuss issues in the U.S.-PRC bilateral relationship, the continued importance of maintaining open lines of communication, and a range of regional and global issues,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. The meeting comes about a year after the two leaders last met in person, during the G20 summit of leading wealthy and developing nations in Bali, Indonesia. \u201cBuilding on their last meeting in November 2022 in Bali, Indonesia, the leaders will also discuss how the United States and the PRC can continue to responsibly manage competition and work together where our interests align, particularly on transnational challenges that affect the international community,\u201d Jean-Pierre added, referring to China\u2019s official name, the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the last year, a senior administration official noted that Biden has \u201cdeepened our alliances\u201d abroad, including with Australia and other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, India and the Philippines. The official said, \u201cNow is precisely the time for high-level diplomacy. Our approach is steady and consistent. We\u2019re not stepping back from our interests and values.\u201d Another senior administration official said that since the leaders last met in Bali, the U.S. has restored diplomatic interactions with Chinese counterparts, highlighting trips to Beijing made by the secretaries of state, treasury and commerce. \u201cThe goals here really are about managing the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict, and ensuring channels of communication are open,\u201d the official said. The U.S. and China have also \u201claunched a number of working-level consultations with the PRC in discreet, carefully chosen areas where deeper discussion can benefit us and global interests, such as arms control, maritime issues, and macroeconomic and debt issues,\u201d the official noted. At the same time, there have been periods of rising tension between both nations, especially after the downing earlier this year of an alleged Chinese spy balloon over U.S. territory and amid Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. The leaders are expected to discuss a range of regional and global issues, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict. When asked if the meeting would be held in the city of San Francisco, officials declined to specify the exact location, citing operational security reasons. Meanwhile, Republicans on the House Select Committee on China are urging Biden ahead of his meeting with Xi to modify U.S. policy toward China and to \u201cchallenge Beijing\u201d to prove that it wants to improve relations with the U.S. Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.

        "title": "Federal appeals court calls Biden's 'ghost gun' limits unlawful",
        "content": "A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that the Biden administration lacked authority to adopt a regulation aimed at reining in privately made firearms called \u201cghost guns\" that are difficult for law enforcement to trace. A three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a group of firearm owners, gun rights groups and manufacturers in declaring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 2022 rule \u201cunlawful.\u201d The panel, comprised entirely of judges appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, largely upheld a Texas judge\u2019s ruling against the rule, which targeted the rapid proliferation of such homemade weapons. The rule updated the definition of a \u201cfirearm,\u201d \u201cframe\u201d and \u201creceiver\u201d under the Gun Control Act of 1968 to address the rise of ghost guns that can be assembled from kits that can be bought online or at a store without a background check. U.S. Circuit Judge Kurt Engelhardt, writing for the 5th Circuit panel, said ATF\u2019s rule \u201cflouts clear statutory text and exceeds the legislatively-imposed limits on agency authority in the name of public policy.\u201d \u201cATF, in promulgating its final rule, attempted to take on the mantle of Congress to \u2018do something\u2019 with respect to gun control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it is not the province of an executive agency to write laws for our nation.\u201d The U.S. Department of Justice and ATF did not respond to requests for comment. But the administration is likely to appeal, after already seeking the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s intervention in the case. The Supreme Court had twice before in August and October acted following rulings by the Texas judge and granted requests by the administration that have allowed the regulations to remain in effect while litigation continues. The administration has said that ghost guns are attractive to criminals and others prohibited from lawfully buying firearms, including minors. There were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported in 2021 to the ATF as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations \u2014 a tenfold increase from 2016, according to the White House. Cody Wisniewski, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Firearms Policy Coalition Action Foundation, in a statement called Thursday\u2019s ruling a \u201cmassive victory against ATF and a huge blow to the Biden administration\u2019s gun control agenda.\u201d ",

        "title": "How the GOP muzzled the quiet coalition that fought foreign propaganda",
        "content": "A once-robust alliance of federal agencies, tech companies, election officials and researchers that worked together to thwart foreign propaganda and disinformation has fragmented after years of sustained Republican attacks. The GOP offensive started during the 2020 election as public critiques and has since escalated into lawsuits, governmental inquiries and public relations campaigns that have succeeded in stopping almost all coordination between the government and social media platforms. The most recent setback came when the FBI put an indefinite hold on most briefings to social media companies about Russian, Iranian and Chinese influence campaigns. Employees at two U.S. tech companies who used to receive regular briefings from the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force told NBC News that it has been months since the bureau reached out.  In a testimony last week to the Senate Homeland Security Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray signaled a significant pullback in communications with tech companies and tied the move to rulings by a conservative federal judge and appeals court that said some government agencies and officials should be restricted from communicating and meeting with social media companies to moderate content. The case is now on hold pending Supreme Court review. \u201cWe\u2019re having some interaction with social media companies,\u201d Wray said. \u201cBut all of those interactions have changed fundamentally in the wake of the court rulings.\u201d Wray didn\u2019t elaborate, but sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that all the FBI\u2019s interactions with tech platforms now have to be pre-approved and supervised by Justice Department lawyers.  The FBI told the House Judiciary Committee that, since the court rulings, the bureau had discovered foreign influence campaigns on social media platforms but in some cases did not inform the companies about them because they were hamstrung by the new legal oversight, according to a congressional official. \u201cThis is the worst possible outcome in terms of the injunction,\u201d said one U.S. official familiar with the matter. \u201cThe symbiotic relationship between the government and the social media companies has definitely been fractured.\u201d The FBI declined to comment. More than a dozen current and former government and tech employees who have been involved in fighting online manipulation campaigns and election falsehoods since 2020 echoed those concerns. Most agreed to speak only on the condition that they not be named, all citing the current climate of harassment against people who work in election and information integrity. A common theme among those interviewed: The chilling effect that Republican attacks had on the sharing of information about possible interference, which could make it easier for foreign adversaries to manipulate U.S. public opinion and harder for 2024 voters to sort out what\u2019s real from what\u2019s fake.  Beyond the FBI briefings, other coordination efforts have folded after facing pressure from conservatives. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which oversees federal election cybersecurity and has become a favorite target of Republicans, has halted its outreach to Silicon Valley, and the Department of Homeland Security has shuttered a board designed to coordinate its anti-disinformation programs.  \u201cSome of these efforts really are designed to isolate people and make them feel like they can\u2019t communicate with CISA, like they can\u2019t communicate with their peers in other states,\u201d a person who works in state election administration said. \u201cPeople feel that things are really, really fraught, and common sense does not rule today,\u201d the person added. Some politicians are sounding the alarm. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said efforts to stop foreign manipulation of U.S. politics are well within the government\u2019s remit.  \u201cI understand we don\u2019t want to interdict constitutionally protected speech, but what is constitutionally protected speech?\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly foreign agents don\u2019t have constitutionally protected speech because they\u2019re not subject to our Constitution. I presume bots don\u2019t have constitutionally protected speech. American citizens do.\u201d Microsoft recently said it expects Russia, Iran and China to engage in sophisticated influence operations ahead of the 2024 election. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee who had vocally pushed for election security coordination after 2016, told NBC News he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the setbacks of the system that defends against social media and election manipulation. \u201cWe are seeing a potential scenario where all the major improvements in identifying, threat-sharing, and public exposure of foreign malign influence activity targeting U.S. elections have been systematically undermined,\u201d Warner said. Before 2016, there was little political will in the U.S. for the government or for tech companies to share intelligence with each other or protect voters from foreign influence campaigns. That year, Russia launched a multifaceted interference campaign that included the Kremlin-tied Internet Research Agency reaching tens of millions of Facebook and Twitter users. Hackers working for Russian intelligence stole and leaked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, probed an election machine company and stole voter information from the state of Illinois. In the aftermath, President Barack Obama\u2019s outgoing secretary for the Department of Homeland Security declared elections to be critical infrastructure, a move that drew immediate criticism from conservative election officials. Congress voted for the Department of Homeland Security to spin out its cyber and infrastructure protection efforts into CISA.  Meanwhile, the FBI created the Foreign Influence Task Force, meant to act as an intermediary that ferried information between the U.S. intelligence community and tech companies. The National Security Agency declined to comment for this story, but its director said in 2022 that the agency had fed intelligence about foreign propagandists to the task force to share with tech platforms. CISA started holding its own meetings with tech companies, briefing them on election administration nuances and helping set up a \u201cswitchboard\u201d system to flag election falsehoods online. The new system allowed a local election official to, for example, communicate to Facebook that a local group was directing people to the wrong polling site, in violation of the company\u2019s policies. These partnerships between government, corporations and legal and academic researchers were praised after 2020 as a crucial part of ensuring a secure election.  After the election, a victory for the Democrats and Joe Biden, President Donald Trump and many other conservatives refused to accept the loss and lashed out at political enemies. They targeted a number of election integrity operations, including the channels that shared information on disinformation, often accusing them of censoring conservative voices.  Many of them focused on Twitter and Facebook\u2019s decision to temporarily limit the reach of a New York Post story about Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Published a few weeks before the election, to the tech platforms it had echoes of when Russia leaked Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016. While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg said FBI statements about certain threats fit the pattern of the Hunter Biden story, both later said the agency didn\u2019t specifically say the Biden emails were a foreign intelligence campaign. Digital forensics experts have verified that at least some of those emails were authentic but much remains unknown about the origins of the files. Since then, Republicans have sent many election integrity efforts into retreat. Last year, the attorneys general offices of Missouri and Louisiana filed a joint lawsuit against the Biden administration, alleging that federal government outreach to tech companies about content on their platform \u2014 including law enforcement tips about election integrity and Covid-19 \u2014 constituted intimidation and a violation of First Amendment protections to free speech. The case is still winding its way through the courts. Last month, the Supreme Court blocked a lower court\u2019s ruling in favor of the conservative states\u2019 case while it hears an appeal. Other efforts have been stopped before they could get started. In March 2022, the Department of Homeland Security created a board to help coordinate its own response to viral falsehoods, prompting outcry from conservatives who claimed the government was policing speech. Nina Jankowicz, a researcher who studies disinformation and technology, was brought in to run the board and quickly became the target of a debilitating harassment campaign. Homeland Security shut down the board five months later. Jankowicz said that the decision likely sent a message to federal workers that they might face retaliation for speaking out in a way that upset vocal critics. \u201cIf you\u2019re the one who\u2019s raising the alarm about foreign interference or about something that is disenfranchising people and letting the platforms know, but it might cost you your job or your safety and security, you think twice about doing that,\u201d Jankowicz said. Biden\u2019s head of CISA, Jen Easterly, a decorated intelligence official who had no prior experience in a public government role, started her tenure with optimism that her agency played a major role confronting disinformation.  \u201cOne could argue we\u2019re in the business of critical infrastructure, and the most critical infrastructure is our cognitive infrastructure, so building that resilience to misinformation and disinformation, I think, is incredibly important,\u201d she said at a talk hosted by Wired magazine in her first year on the job. But Easterly, who frequently characterizes herself as nonpartisan, soon withdrew the agency from roles that most actively fought disinformation. Aside from maintaining a webpage that corrects common misconceptions about how elections work, CISA now focuses more on goals like protecting poll workers\u2019 physical safety, connecting election officials with cybersecurity resources, and pushing software companies to do a better job building secure programs. CISA stopped briefing platforms about how U.S. elections are administered after the 2022 midterms, a current CISA employee said, though they did not attribute the move to Republican pressure. Two people familiar with the agency said Easterly had pulled back from outreach to social media companies after being surprised by the severity of conservatives\u2019 attacks Republican demonization of the agency hasn\u2019t abated. After the GOP took the House of Representatives in 2022, the House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has spent much of this term focused on grievances from the 2020 election. It subpoenaed Easterly earlier this year, then issued a report that claimed \u201cCISA metastasized into the nerve center of the federal government\u2019s domestic surveillance and censorship operations on social media.\u201d In a podcast interview on \u201cOn with Kara Swisher\u201d in June, Easterly explained that CISA will also no longer help flag state and local election officials\u2019 concerns to social media companies. \u201cI need to ensure we are able to do our core mission, to reduce risk to critical infrastructure. And at this point in time, I do not think the risk of us dealing with social media platforms is worth any benefit, quite frankly,\u201d Easterly said, though she did not specify the source of the risk. \u201cI made a decision not to do that. So we are not doing that. Local election officials can give that to the platforms themselves, and I think that\u2019s the right place for us to be,\u201d she said. Through an agency spokesperson, Easterly declined to comment. In an emailed statement, she said: \u201cElection security is one of CISA\u2019s top priorities, and along with our interagency partners, we\u2019re fully focused on supporting state and local election officials as they prepare for the 2024 election cycle. As we have since 2017, CISA will continue to lean forward and do our part to ensure the American people can have confidence in the security and resilience of our most sacred democratic process.\u201d Meanwhile, some platforms have cut back on trust and safety teams. Tech companies are still sharing their findings with each other, a Meta spokesperson told NBC News. The exception is X, whose owner Elon Musk released a giant cache of emails and company documents related to its previous trust and safety efforts and also made huge cuts to its trust and safety and election integrity teams. During the Israel-Hamas war, X has left viral terror videos from Hamas go viral and linger on the site for days. One current X employee, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak for the company, said they had no remaining faith that the company could handle propaganda campaigns. \u201cThe company no longer has the team, the tools, or the capabilities to identify and mitigate these attacks,\u201d they said.

        "title": "Rep. Elise Stefanik files ethics complaint against judge in Trump's civil fraud trial",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, has filed a judicial ethics complaint against the judge presiding over the New York civil fraud case against Donald Trump, accusing Judge Arthur Engoron of \u201cweaponized lawfare\u201d against the former president, and calling on the judge to recuse himself. Engoron has exhibited \u201cclear judicial bias\u201d against Trump, including by telling Trump\u2019s attorney that the former president is \u201cjust a bad guy\u201d whom New York Attorney General Letitia James \u201cshould go after,\u201d Stefanik, R-N.Y., said in a letter to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. She said the judge has failed to honor Trump\u2019s due process rights, concerns that she said are exacerbated by the former president\u2019s position as the front-runner for the presidential nomination. Engoron is presiding over a bench trial in the $250 million lawsuit, meaning the judge will also determine guilt and any penalties in the case. The suit, filed by James last year, accuses Trump of inflating asset values for financial gain. Trump testified angrily on Monday in the high-stakes case and has complained and clashed with the judge for weeks. Engoron issued a partial gag order on Trump last month after he made disparaging remarks about a law clerk on social media and to reporters. He was fined twice for violating the gag order. The judge expanded the gag order last week to include the former president\u2019s lawyers. \u201cI filed an official judicial complaint against Judge Arthur Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York\u2019s disgraceful lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization,\u201d Stefanik said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cAmericans are sick and tired of the blatant corruption by radical Leftist judges in NY. All New Yorkers must speak out against the dangerous weaponized lawfare against President Trump.\u201d Stefanik said in the letter to accompany the complaint that Engoron had illegally gagged Trump\u2019s protected political speech, violated political giving rules with financial contributions to Democrats as recently as 2018, and ignored a decision on the appropriate statute of limitations in the case. At the start of the trial, Engoron \u201cinfamously smiled and posed for the cameras,\u201d she noted. \u201cIf Judge Engoron can railroad a billionaire New York businessman, a former President of the United States, and the leading presidential candidate, just imagine what he could do to all New Yorkers,\u201d Stefanik writes. \u201cJudge Engoron\u2019s lawlessness sends an ominous and illegal warning to New York business owners: If New York judges don\u2019t like your politics, they will destroy your business, the livelihood of your employees, and you personally. This Commission cannot let this continue.\u201d \u201cAll Americans, including political opponents, must receive due process and equal protection under our U.S. and New York Constitutions,\u201d Stefanik wrote. \u201cJudge Engoron\u2019s disdain for President Trump and his politics are evident, and the Commission must take corrective action to restore a just process and protect our constitutional rights. Judge Engoron must recuse from this case.\u201d Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the federal judge presiding over Trump\u2019s criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election had violated his First Amendment rights when issuing a gag order. Stefanik was the first member of Republican leadership to endorse Trump\u2019s bid for another run at the White House and is a close ally of the former president. The top New York Republican in the House, Stefanik is also suing Gov. Kathy Hochul over a mail-in voting expansion. Trump faces a demanding trial schedule in his civil and criminal cases, with the lawsuit in New York and indictments in Georgia, Florida, Manhattan and Washington, D.C. Four members of the Trump family, including Trump, have testified in the New York case, which could cripple their business. Overnight, Trump lashed out at the judge in New York on social media, accusing Engoron and James of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct by using \u201cValuations so LOW that they are Fraudulent.\u201d James has charged Trump with allegedly overstating his family business\u2019s real estate assets.

        "content": "MERRIMACK, N.H. \u2014 Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be visiting Israel on Sunday, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to travel to the country since the outbreak of the war. During a town hall in Merrimack, New Hampshire, on Thursday, Christie said he plans to talk to families of the people taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, members of the Israel Defense Forces and government officials. He told reporters he's unable to share more specifics about whom he's talking with until he gets there because of safety concerns. Christie told the audience he is leaving for his trip Friday. He said he wants to \"see it for myself,\" adding, \"I don\u2019t think you can try to be president of the United States and be afraid to go and see what\u2019s happening on the ground.\" \u201cIf you really want to lead, you need to go over and show the people of Israel, that one person running for president of United States cares enough to get on an airplane and get over there and do what needs to be done to find out how we fix this problem,\u201d Christie later added.  Follow live updates of the Israel-Hamas war here.  Christie said the goal of his trip is to learn. \u201cI\u2019m just going to, like, ask a lot of questions and then shut up and listen, and hopefully it\u2019ll make me a better candidate. And I\u2019m confident it will make me a better president,\u201d he said. Christie told reporters Israel\u2019s foreign ministry invited him come to Israel. Asked whether the ministry reached out to every candidate, he said, \u201cI have no idea, but I can just tell you that they said they appreciated the things I was saying and the stance I was taking, if I was interested in coming over, they will be able to welcome me. And I made the decision to come.\u201d During the debate hosted by NBC News on Wednesday night, Christie said if he were in the Oval Office on the phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he would say, \u201cAmerica is here no matter what it is you need at any time to preserve the state of Israel.\u201d This is not Christie\u2019s first time visiting a conflict zone while running for president. He made a surprise trip to Ukraine in early August. CNN, which first broke this story, reports he is also planning to visit a part of southern Israel known as the Gaza envelope, a populated area that is about five miles from the Gaza Strip.

        "content": "President Joe Biden is celebrating his party\u2019s election wins this week and claiming credit for some of the victories, including the Kentucky governor\u2019s re-election. In his first public remarks about Tuesday\u2019s elections, Biden said at a campaign event Thursday night that his administration\u2019s policies were resonating with voters. \u201cThe Biden-Harris agenda has taken hold,\u201d he said at a campaign fundraiser in Chicago. \u201cPeople are winning elections on it over and over and over.\u201d Specifically, Biden touted the re-election of Gov. Andy Beshear, saying, \"In Kentucky, a Democratic governor was re-elected after \u2026 running on programs that were all Biden initiatives.\" He also pointed to Democratic wins in Ohio, where voters passed a ballot initiative that enshrines abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. And in doing so, Biden took aim at his potential opponent next November by saying, \"The only reason abortion is banned in America is because of Donald Trump.\u201d Biden also highlighted victories in Pennsylvania, which included the expansion of a Democratic majority on the state's Supreme Court and the election of Philadelphia's first Black female mayor, as well as Virginia Democrats\u2019 reclaiming control of the Legislature. \u201cSince I came off the sidelines to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, we haven\u2019t stopped winning,\u201d Biden said, after he cited the party's performance in the midterm elections. Although Biden credited his administration for this week's Democratic victories, some of the biggest wins most likely have roots independent of the president. Biden, for example, did not campaign for Beshear, whom he referred to as a \"good friend\" Thursday. A Democratic strategist in Kentucky said this week that Beshear is a governor \"who's extremely well liked,\" while a senior Democratic aide to a lawmaker in a swing state noted that while \u201cit\u2019s a win for Democrats, it\u2019s not like the president\u2019s name was on the ballot.\" An NBC News exit poll in Ohio this week showed strong Democratic turnout coupled with poor opinions of Biden \u2014 his approval rating among Ohio voters was 39%. Nearly three-quarters, 73%, said Biden should not seek re-election, compared with 63% who said Trump shouldn't run, either. In his remarks, Biden appeared to joke about recent polls that showed him trailing Trump in battleground states but said there are \"10 other polls, and every one we are winning.\" A New York Times/Siena College poll released Sunday found Trump leading Biden in five of the six swing states that Biden won in 2020, prompting handwringing among Democrats over the weekend. Biden's remarks Thursday were not the first time he has boasted about this week's election results. He was quick to highlight the party's wins on election night. \u201cAcross the country tonight, democracy won and MAGA lost,\u201d Biden tweeted Tuesday. \u201cVoters vote. Polls don\u2019t. Now let\u2019s go win next year.\u201d Zo\u00eb Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "FBI investigating letters with suspicious powder sent to election workers in multiple states",
        "content": "The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating a series of letters containing suspicious powder that were sent to election workers in multiple states in recent days, law enforcement officials told NBC News. In at least one case, the powder tested positive in a field test for fentanyl, officials said Thursday. There have been no reports of anyone suffering ill health effects, the officials said. The substances found in the letters are still being lab-tested. In a statement Thursday evening, the FBI said that it had responded to \"multiple incidents involving suspicious letters sent to ballot counting centers in several states.\" The bureau did not provide further details, citing \"ongoing matters.\" Officials in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state have all reported suspicious letters addressed to election officers or workers. The FBI field office in Portland said it had \u201cresponded to multiple incidents involving suspicious letters sent to several ballot counting centers in Oregon.\" The FBI's Seattle and Atlanta field offices issued similar statements. The Texas Department of Public Safety said it had also responded to a report of a letter containing an unknown substance that had been mailed to the state attorney general's office in Austin on Thursday morning. It said in a statement that preliminary tests on the envelope had come back negative, but that the FBI would do further testing. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber said Thursday that federal and state authorities were investigating after the U.S. Postal Service intercepted two suspicious envelopes headed to election facilities in Los Angeles and Sacramento. Weber said there has been no confirmation that the envelopes contained any toxic substances. \u201cNevertheless, we are advising local election offices to take precautions before handling mail that arrives at their facilities,\u201d she said in a statement. The Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s Office said in a statement Thursday that the federal government had alerted local authorities of suspicious letters addressed to election offices \u201cin multiple states, including Nevada,\u201d and that it was in touch with the FBI, the Postal Service and others. Law enforcement officials said it\u2019s too soon to say where the letters came from or who may be responsible. The Postal Inspectors declined to discuss details of their probe. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger referred to the envelopes that were sent to Fulton County as domestic terrorism, and said in a statement that his office was \"working with our state and federal partners to determine if any additional Georgia officials are being targeted.\" Robb Pitts, chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, said in a statement, \"This incident underscores the issue of election worker safety and the need for stronger election safety. Our recently-opened Elections Hub will allow us to improve security operations as we go into the 2024 elections.\" Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs told The Associated Press the incidents in his state were \u201cacts of terrorism to threaten our elections.\u201d Hobbs' office said Wednesday that elections offices in King, Pierce, Skagit and Spokane counties had all been sent envelopes containing unknown powdery substances. His office had also noted that during the state's Aug. 1 primary, election officials in King and Okanogan counties received suspicious substances in envelopes. Investigators determined the one sent to King County contained trace amounts of fentanyl, while the substance in the envelope sent to Okanogan County was deemed unharmful. The mailings come as election officials around the country have complained of increased threats, with some pointing to the bogus rigged election claims by former President Donald Trump and others since the 2020 election. Raffensperger said in his statement that election officials should \"be free from fear and intimidation.\" \"We will work tirelessly to ensure that Georgia elections remain free, fair, and secure,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin says he will not seek re-election in 2024",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced Thursday he won't run for re-election next year, a much anticipated decision that will reshape the battle for Senate control in 2024. \"After months of deliberation and long conversations with my family, I believe in my heart of hearts that I have accomplished what I set out to do for West Virginia. I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I will not be running for re-election to the United States Senate, but what I will be doing is traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together,\" Manchin said in a written and video statement.  \"To the West Virginians who have put their trust in me and fought side by side to make our state better \u2014 it has been an honor of my life to serve you. Thank you,\" he said. The decision by Manchin, a former governor who was elected to the Senate in a 2010 special election, is an earthquake in the battle for the Senate majority. It all but assures Republicans a pickup in the ruby-red state of West Virginia, where Manchin has defied political gravity for years by keeping the seat in his party's hands. Donald Trump won the state by 39 points in 2020. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a terse statement: \u201cWe like our odds in West Virginia.\u201d Gov. Jim Justice and Rep. Alex Mooney are both already running for the Republican nomination for the seat. \"Senator Joe Manchin and I have not always agreed on policy and politics, but we\u2019re both lifelong West Virginians who love this state beyond belief, and I respect and thank him for his many years of public service,\u201d Justice said. Democrats do not have a viable alternative to Manchin in the state. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday expressed confidence that the party would hold Senate control, without mentioning Manchin. \u201cSenate Democrats are in strong shape and are well-positioned to hold, strengthen, and bolster our majority and continue to deliver for American families,\u201d Schumer said in a brief statement on X. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson David Bergstein elaborated by saying, \"In addition to defending our battle-tested incumbents, we\u2019ve already expanded the battleground map to Texas and Florida, where formidable Democratic candidates are out-raising unpopular Republican incumbents and the DSCC is making investments to lay the groundwork for our campaigns\u2019 victories.\u201d Democrats have had a love-hate relationship with Manchin, who has often been a thorn in the side of President Joe Biden's priorities and forced him to scale back his ambitious domestic agenda. But Manchin was also the linchpin of the 50-50 Democratic Senate in 2021 and 2022. Without his seat, the chamber would have been run by Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., not Schumer. Manchin provided the crucial vote to enable many of Biden's policy victories \u2014 including the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act and scores of new federal judges. Biden on Thursday highlighted the work he has done with Manchin, saying, \u201cJoe and I have worked together to get things done for hardworking families.\u201d \u201cJoe, Gayle, and the entire Manchin family should feel proud of the Senator\u2019s service to West Virginia and to our country,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to continuing our work together to get things done for the American people.\u201d In terms of Manchin\u2019s future, a source with direct knowledge of his plans said: \u201cNo specific decisions have been made other than a commitment to find a way to change the country\u2019s political dialogue.\u201d Asked whether Manchin is considering running for president \u2014 including as a Democrat, an independent or as a No Labels candidate \u2014 the source replied, \u201cNothing is off the table.\u201d Following Manchin\u2019s announcement, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll miss him. We\u2019re friends.\u201d Kaine said that he encouraged Manchin to run for another Senate term. When asked if he thought Manchin would run for president, Kaine said, \u201cNo, no.\u201d Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Ron DeSantis says it's 'out of bounds' to attack candidates' kids \u2014 with one exception",
        "content": "MIAMI \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday that he believes going after an opponent\u2019s children is \u201cout of bounds\u201d in political warfare. DeSantis, however, goes after President Joe Biden\u2019s son on a weekly basis. In an interview with Fox News, DeSantis said he disagreed with Vivek Ramaswamy bringing up former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley\u2019s daughter in a discussion about TikTok during the presidential primary debate hosted by NBC News on Wednesday night. He cautioned against dragging family members into the political fray. \u201cI think the kids are out of bounds. I didn\u2019t think that was an appropriate thing to do,\u201d said DeSantis, who has three young children. \u201cI keep the kids out of it for sure,\u201d he added of his own conduct. But out on the campaign trail, the governor does not shy from making a punchline out of Hunter Biden, 53, joking about his history of addiction and embarrassing details of his personal life that have surfaced publicly. While Hunter Biden is an adult, so is Haley\u2019s daughter \u2014 albeit a few decades younger than the president's son. Both, however, are politicians\u2019 children who are not in elected office. For example, DeSantis has repeatedly mentioned Hunter Biden during his stump speech when talking about banning explicit material from Florida public schools \u2014 a response to critics who say the DeSantis administration has banned books about gender identity and sexual orientation. \u201cYou want to do adult material? Do that on your own time,\u201d DeSantis told a crowd at a campaign event in Murrells Inlet, S.C., in October. But then came the quip: \u201cHey, go look at Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop for all I care, just keep it away from our kids.\u201d The line refers to information released from Hunter Biden\u2019s personal laptop, which has fueled stories and questions about his personal life, drug use and finances. His lawyers have said that allies of former President Donald Trump trafficked in information stolen from the device. And at a rally where he received an endorsement from Iowa\u2019s popular Gov. Kim Reynolds, DeSantis brandished another favorite crack at Biden\u2019s second-oldest son. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in the White House, the only thing our kids are going to be bringing back is homework, not cocaine,\u201d DeSantis said to an amused crowd on Monday evening during a speech in Des Moines, implying \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the president\u2019s son was connected to the cocaine found in the White House earlier this year. The Secret Service closed its investigation into the origin of the substance in July without identifying a culprit. The jokes, meant as mocking asides to DeSantis\u2019 broader campaign themes, often draw laughter and applause from crowds. In a statement to NBC News, DeSantis press secretary Bryan Griffin said there was a distinction between the governor\u2019s attacks on Hunter Biden and Ramaswamy\u2019s reference to Haley\u2019s daughter. \u201cHunter Biden is an adult who has likely committed criminal activity and leveraged his father\u2019s time in the White House to get lucrative contracts and payments from foreign entities. He\u2019s inserted himself into the national dialogue through his own actions,\u201d Griffin said.   \u201cThere is clearly a distinction between him and family members of other political figures who would only be relevant by association,\u201d Griffin added. In September, federal prosecutors indicted Hunter Biden on three counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. He has pleaded not guilty. But many Republican swipes against Hunter Biden are based on unproven theories and occasionally veer into personal attacks. DeSantis isn\u2019t the only GOP candidate to consistently go after the Biden family. Ramaswamy, 38,  has long spread the conspiracy theory that the United States is funding Ukraine only because of Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, including at the debate Wednesday evening. \u201cJoe Biden sold off our foreign policy,\u201d Ramaswamy said without any evidence to support his claim. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden got a $5 million bribe from Ukraine. That\u2019s why we\u2019re sending $200 billion back to that same country,\u201d Ramaswamy said on the debate stage. Ramaswamy appeared to be referring to an alleged bribe involving the president and his son. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has claimed he was told by a whistleblower \u2014 whose claims are uncorroborated \u2014 about a tip regarding a $5 million payment from a foreign national to Joe Biden, then the vice president, and a family member \u201crelating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.\u201d As for the South Carolinians at the debate, Sen. Tim Scott and Haley, they typically go after Hunter Biden when it relates to his criminal investigations. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take four years for the evidence and the information about Hunter Biden\u2019s transactions, from drugs to guns to contracts, to come to the surface unless there are forces within the DOJ suppressing that information,\u201d Scott said on Iowa news radio host Scott Conway's show in July. Scott has long argued the handling of Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal indictments is proof that the Department of Justice is corrupt, calling the department's activity \u201cdisgusting, ugly, nasty, biased weaponizing.\u201d Haley has encouraged the House impeachment inquiry into the business dealings of the president and his son, but she has \u2014 unlike some of the other candidates \u2014 refrained from making personal attacks against Hunter Biden. And of course, no candidate has gone after Hunter Biden more than Trump, who was impeached in 2019 for his attempts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to find dirt on Hunter Biden and his father. On Wednesday evening, while counterprogramming the debate with a rally in Hialeah, Florida, Trump said the United States is a nation \u201cwhere Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop from hell was Russian disinformation and the FBI knew it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Alec Hern\u00e1ndez is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

        "title": "Why the attacks between Ramaswamy and Haley seem so personal \u2014 and spiteful",
        "content": "As the playing field shrinks in the Republican presidential primary campaign, no two candidates have been at each other\u2019s throats quite like Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley.  At Wednesday night\u2019s debate hosted by NBC News in Miami, the two Indian Americans sparred in one of their fieriest exchanges yet, peaking when Ramaswamy questioned Haley\u2019s daughter\u2019s presence on TikTok and ending with Haley retorting, \u201cKeep my daughter\u2019s name out of your voice. \u2026 You\u2019re just scum.\u201d  The two left the stage after having shaken hands with everyone but each other. The hostility has been building for months, with jabs more biting and personal than those levied at any of the other candidates. Ramaswamy has invoked Haley\u2019s Indian legal first name, Nimarata, in a way that could be read as schoolyard taunting. It\u2019s significant, experts say, that the two South Asians in the race are going the hardest at each other.  The similarities in their backgrounds make their constant back-and-forths feel almost familial, psychologists and community experts said.  \u201cIn terms of the optics, there are times in which it looks like an extended family argument, even the kind of argument that might happen over a family dinner or something like that,\u201d said Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of the nonprofit group AAPI Data.  While competition is inherent to politics, Indian American clinical psychologist Jyothsna Bhat sees another layer beneath the surface of Haley and Ramaswamy\u2019s exchanges.  \u201cIt hits differently when it\u2019s South Asian individuals because of that mentality of there\u2019s just not enough room for the two,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in us, whether we have to do better than our friends, than our cousins, than other family members. \u2026 Because think about it, it\u2019s been such a competition even to come to this country.\u201d When Ramaswamy and Haley argue onstage, they often tend to go \u201cbelow the belt,\u201d Bhat said.  In Wednesday\u2019s debate, Ramaswamy took aim at Haley with the question: \u201cDo you want a leader from a different generation who\u2019s going to put this country first? Or do you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels?\u201d Meanwhile, in the first debate, she told him, \u201cYour ego is bigger than your r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d and in the second debate, she said: \u201cEvery time I hear you talk, I feel a little bit dumber. ... We can\u2019t trust you.\u201d  Ramaswamy has made his mark on the 2024 campaign season with attacks on fellow candidates, debate moderators and other members of the media. But Haley has emerged as his clear rival. Bhat said invoking Haley\u2019s daughter was particularly biting and revealing from a psychological perspective. \u201cBoldly calling out her daughter, that\u2019s almost like a South Asian uncle,\u201d she said. \u201cThe audacity of that is very interesting.\u201d  Ramaswamy\u2019s team defended his remarks, saying in a message: \u201cHe didn\u2019t criticize her daughter. He [sic] daughter is 25 years old and he pointed out she uses tik tok, just like he does.\u201d Haley\u2019s team declined to comment on the dynamic between the two, referring NBC News to her real-time response when she called him \u201cscum.\u201d  \u201cLook, I\u2019m a mom, so the second that you go and you start saying something about my 25-year-old daughter, I\u2019m going to get my back up,\u201d she said in a post-debate interview with NBC News anchors. \u201cI don\u2019t even give him the time of day. He has proven he is just not worthy of being president of the United States.\u201d But it\u2019s far from the first time Ramaswamy has made it personal with Haley. He has made multiple digs at her having changed her name, including in a memo in August on his website in which he wrote, \u201cKeep lying, Nimarata Randhawa.\u201d At the time, Ramaswamy\u2019s team said the purpose of the comment was to point out \u201cher lies on Israel.\u201d He also referred to her name and religion changes at a town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cAn easy thing for me to do being a politician to follow this track is shorten my name, profess to be a Christian and then run,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest \u2014 it happens. Make Vivek \u2018Vikki\u2019 or whatever.\u201d Surface-level pettiness masks a strategy in this instance, Ramakrishnan said.  \u201cYes, you can say that he\u2019s being petty, but he\u2019s also pointing to something to contrast his candidacy with hers and somehow implying that he\u2019s being more genuine by keeping his name,\u201d he said. \u201cHe decries identity politics but selectively engages in identity politics himself to score political points.\u201d For more from NBC Asian America, sign up for our weekly newsletter. Haley has hit back with escalating intensity, as well, calling Ramaswamy \u201cchildish\u201d for name-calling. When he\u2019s speaking about her onstage, Haley can sometimes be seen shaking her head or rolling her eyes.  Ramaswamy\u2019s senior adviser and communications director, Tricia McLaughlin, team didn\u2019t comment further on the escalating tension between the two candidates beyond saying the following: \u201cBy the standards Nikki and her team apply about family, I fully expect she will stop invoking Hunter Biden\u2019s name.\u201d Their comments and reactions are unlike what\u2019s directed at the other candidates onstage, Bhat said.  \u201cI think she wouldn\u2019t have done that if it was DeSantis or something. It would have been a different reaction,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s that familiarity because it\u2019s a fellow South Asian. I think it\u2019s stemming from \u2018I know who you are; don\u2019t try to pull that one.\u2019\u201d Bhat reflected on the debate stages of the 2020 election and the camaraderie between candidates who had similar backgrounds, like Sen. Cory Booker and Vice President Kamala Harris.  \u201cThat sort of \u2018we\u2019re in this together\u2019 type of attitude, that\u2019s just not the case here,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could be a formidable pair.\u201d But polling in third and fourth place, far behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, they\u2019re both long shots in this primary, according to experts. \u201cThe folks on the stage yesterday were not running for president. They were running for vice president,\u201d said Varun Nikore, the founding executive director of the Democratic-aligned AAPI Victory Alliance. He said a vastly Democratic Indian American community might not even be watching Haley and Ramaswamy spar for anything other than entertainment value.  \u201cThe way that they swiped at each other is such a complete embarrassment for our culture and our people,\u201d Nikore said. \u201cAnd it really does not represent who we all are in this country.\u201d In his personal attacks, Ramaswamy isn\u2019t gaining fans among mainstream Republican voters, Nikore said, and it\u2019s being reflected in the polls.  \u201cHe tends to have a lot of applause lines when he says very extremist things that, frankly, sound like something Donald Trump would say,\u201d Nikore said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between getting applause in an audience of hard-core partisans and then trying to appeal to the first voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and [South] Carolina. It\u2019s not translatable.\u201d Sakshi Venkatraman is a reporter for NBC Asian America. ",

        "title": "Biden stresses support for unions and meets with UAW president after strike",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on Thursday emphasized his support for unions during a trip to Illinois and celebrated the reopening of a Stellantis plant after tentative deals were recently struck between the United Auto Workers and three major U.S. automakers following a strike that lasted weeks. Biden also met with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, as well as union members in his visit to the city of Belvidere, northwest of Chicago. \"I want to thank you for your commitment to the solidarity, for exercising your right to bargain collectively,\" Biden said in remarks delivered to an audience of union members. \"You made this happen.\" The president told the crowd that they are changing \"the face of the country economically\" with their efforts. The plant's planned reopening will help highlight Biden's commitment to \"rehiring and retooling the EV and EV battery jobs in the same communities where auto jobs have created good-paying union jobs for decades,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday, ahead of the president's trip. The plant had been idled early this year. The UAW struck a tentative agreement with General Motors late last month, days after making similar breakthroughs with Ford and Stellantis. The White House and Fain have touted the Stellantis plant's planned reopening as the result of the tentative agreement between the UAW and the company, which owns Chrysler. The White House has said that the factory's reopening would bring back \u201cmore than all of the 1,200 jobs lost, and at higher wages.\u201d The company is also adding about 1,000 new union jobs because Stellantis is investing in new battery manufacturing, the White House said. Biden frequently highlights unions in his economy speeches, claiming he is the \u201cmost pro-union president\u201d in history. He visited a UAW picket line in Michigan early in the autoworkers\u2019 strike, becoming the first sitting president to do so. \u201cYou saved the automobile industry back in 2008 and before,\u201d Biden said in remarks on the picket line in September. \u201cYou made a lot of sacrifices. You gave up a lot, and the companies were in trouble. But now they\u2019re doing incredibly well. And guess what? You should be doing incredibly well too.\u201d Ahead of his remarks on Thursday, a local union leader gave Biden a T-shirt from the union chapter, which he wore during his speech. \"That shirt looks good on you,\" an audience member yelled during the program. Biden's remarks were briefly interrupted at the beginning by a protester who shouted for him to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The crowd booed the interruption while Biden tried to quell the tension, saying: \"Let her go ... it's OK.\" The UAW strike started in mid-September as union members worked to negotiate contracts with the three big automakers. The union was ultimately able to negotiate contracts that would provide union members with increased pay and reinstate cost-of-living adjustments, among other benefits. \"My administration will keep working to make sure UAW has what it needs to outcompete China and everyone else in the world. I've reminded other world leaders it's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America,\" Biden said during his remarks. Biden also took a shot at former president Donald Trump during his speech, mentioning him by name which he often refrains from doing in remarks to the public. \"Is there ever anything America set its mind to as a nation that we\u2019ve done together and we haven\u2019t succeeded?\" Biden said. \"Well, you know, Donald Trump often says, 'We\u2019re now a failing nation. We\u2019re a nation in decline.'\" The audience booed in response, with one person shouting, \"put him in jail!\" Following the event, Fain called Biden's visit \"a great day.\" But despite the praise, the UAW has not endorsed Biden's re-election bid. The union endorsed him in 2020. \"Our primary focus right now is just getting the contracts ratified,\" Fain told NBC News. \"You know, getting the membership, the information they need to make a decision.\" He added that there will be a time for making endorsements. Biden's remarks come just a day after a tentative agreement was also reached between the actors union SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, potentially ending a monthslong actors strike that along with a writers strike, ground Hollywood to a halt. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is a trade group that bargains for studio and streaming services and represents Comcast, which owns NBC News. \u201cWhen both sides come to the table to negotiate in earnest, they can make businesses stronger and allow workers to secure pay and benefits that help them raise families and retire with dignity,\u201d Biden said in a statement celebrating the tentative agreement.

        "title": "Steve Bannon seeks to overturn conviction for defying Jan. 6 committee",
        "content": "Lawyers for Steve Bannon made their case before a federal appeals court Thursday in a bid to overturn the former Trump adviser's four-month prison sentence for his refusal to cooperate with a subpoena from the House Jan. 6 committee. \u201cThis case is as clear as day that the conviction has to be overturned,\" Bannon attorney David Schoen told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., after arguments before a three-judge panel. Summarizing the arguments he made before the judges, Schoen said that former President Donald Trump had invoked executive privilege which prevented Bannon from complying with the House subpoena and that even if the privilege had been improperly invoked, Bannon was relying on the advice of his lawyer who told him he couldn\u2019t testify before the committee. \u201cMr. Bannon acted as his lawyer told him to act, and in the only way he understood the law permitted him to act with respect to the subpoena. He didn\u2019t ignore the subpoena,\u201d Schoen told reporters. Bannon did not attend Thursday\u2019s arguments, but notable faces in the courtroom included Molly Gaston and J.P. Cooney from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s office. Gaston and Cooney had previously prosecuted the case against Bannon before moving over to the special counsel\u2019s office. Bannon was subpoenaed in Smith\u2019s grand jury investigation into Jan. 6 and Trump\u2019s efforts to stay in office, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News in June. Schoen expressed hope Thursday that the panel would rule in Banon's favor, but acknowledged to reporters that he may need to appeal the case to the full D.C. Circuit \u201cand then go to the Supreme Court if we don\u2019t succeed there.\u201d Bannon was sentenced in October of last year to four months in federal prison along with a $6,500 fine, but U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols suspended the sentence until the appeals process plays out. He was charged with contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee, which led to his conviction on two counts in July of last year after a jury trial. Bannon, who hosts the \u201cBannon\u2019s War Room\u201d podcast, has argued that he should have been permitted to invoke executive privilege and other defenses before the jury in the trial. \u201cThe lower court erred by prohibiting Mr. Bannon from putting his defenses before the jury in this case, in violation of his rights under the 5th and 6th Amendments to the United States Constitution,\u201d Schoen wrote in a brief to the court in May. \u201cBannon was barred from putting on any evidence or argument that he believed he responded to the subpoena in the only way the law permitted once executive privilege was invoked, and that he acted in the manner his experienced lawyer directed him that he had to act as a matter of law,\u201d Schoen added at the time. After Bannon\u2019s sentencing, Schoen argued that his client had followed the advice of counsel at the time in snubbing the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s subpoenas and argued that Bannon respected a claim of executive privilege from Trump \u2014 a claim prosecutors had disputed. \u201cQuite frankly, Mr. Bannon should make no apology,\u201d Schoen said after Bannon\u2019s sentencing last year, adding: \u201cNo American should make an apology for the way Mr. Bannon proceeded in this case.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing here to deter. There is nothing here to punish,\u201d he said at the time. Critics have argued that Bannon's executive privilege claim was nullified since he was longer working in the White House. Schoen has pushed back on that assertion. \"The Justice Department has said over and over again, that it doesn\u2019t matter whether the person is a currently employed, just as it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s the president, or former president,\" he told reporters on Thursday. Bannon served in the White House during the first seven months of Trump\u2019s presidency. The House Jan. 6 committee disbanded at the beginning of this year without receiving information from Bannon. Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "FBI Director Wray criticizes selection of new headquarters site, citing 'potential conflict'",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 FBI Director Christopher Wray told agency staffers that he was concerned about \u201ca potential conflict of interest\u201d involving the selection of the bureau\u2019s new headquarters in Maryland, according to an email obtained by NBC News. On Thursday, the General Services Administration confirmed that the FBI\u2019s new home would be in Greenbelt, about 13 miles northeast of Washington, seeming to bring to an end a drawn-out and politically fraught site selection process. Two other finalists were Springfield, Virginia, and Landover, Maryland. In his unusually pointed letter to staffers, Wray said the FBI has \u201cconcerns about fairness and transparency in the process and GSA\u2019s failure to adhere to its own site selection plan,\u201d adding that a senior GSA executive overruled a board decision and picked land that is owned by the executive\u2019s previous employer, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. A three-member panel had initially determined that Springfield, Virginia, was the best location. The decision of a political appointee overseeing the process to reject career officials\u2019 \u201cunanimous\u201d recommendation, Wray wrote, wasn\u2019t \u201c\u2018inherently inappropriate,' but it is 'exceedingly rare.\u2019\u201d \u201cIn particular, the FBI observed that, at times, outside information was inserted into the process in a manner which appeared to disproportionately favor Greenbelt, and the justifications for the departures from the panel were varied and inconsistent,\u201d Wray said. Politicians from Virginia echoed Wray\u2019s concerns about the process and voiced frustration after years of fighting with their Maryland counterparts to host the new headquarters. Some called for an investigation and for the GSA\u2019s decision to be reversed. \u201cIt is clear that this process has been irrevocably undermined and tainted, and this decision must now be reversed,\u201d said a statement from both of the commonwealth\u2019s senators, eight of its House members and Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he plans to call for an inspector general\u2019s investigation, saying, \u201cThis process has been rotten.\u201d \u201cYes, there should be an IG investigation, and we will call for one, but my hope would be the administration would realize this process has been rotten,\u201d Warner told NBC News, \u201cAnd, you know, the folks who work at the FBI deserve better answers; the American taxpayers deserve better answers.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News that he and other Virginia lawmakers were \u201creally disappointed\u201d by the decision and \u201cknew that there had been political calculation to change the criteria.\u201d \u201cIt should definitely be reversed,\u201d Kaine added. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said the senators are \u201cjust wrong on that.\u201d \u201cThe GSA made the right decision based upon the taxpayers, based upon the mission, the availability of the site, the ability of the site to handle the growth that\u2019s necessary,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best transit-related location. I mean, the list goes on and on and on why they chose that site.\u201d The Biden administration defended the process as \u201cfair and transparent.\u201d White House principal deputy press secretary Olivia Dalton told reporters that Greenbelt was the cheapest location with the best access to public transit for FBI workers. GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan also defended the process. \u201cGSA and FBI teams have spent countless hours working closely together over many months, so we\u2019re disappointed that the FBI Director is now making inaccurate claims directed at our agency, our employees, and our site selection plan and process,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion that there was inappropriate interference is unfounded.\u201d Carnahan said the GSA has tried to \u201cincorporate the FBI\u2019s feedback and appropriately address their concerns\u201d throughout the process. However, Wray said the FBI\u2019s concerns about the process \u201cremain unresolved,\u201d although Congress \u201cwill control the next steps.\u201d \u201cThere are still a lot of open questions, and we\u2019ve still got a long way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ultimately, our focus will remain on doing everything we can to ensure the FBI has a Headquarters that best meets the needs of our workforce, our mission, and the American people.\u201d    Frank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.

        "title": "Conservative groups made school boards a new front in the culture wars. This week they lost ground.",
        "content": "Liberal and moderate school board candidates claimed victory across the country this week, wresting majority control from Republicans in some swing suburban districts, fending off challenges in liberal communities, and defeating some conservatives who had sparked intense backlash in right-leaning counties. While school board elections are officially nonpartisan in most of the 16 states that held them on Tuesday, the rancor over culture war issues such as book bans and policies dealing with gender and race polarized many of the contests. And in many of the districts where these issues have dominated board meetings and local politics, conservative candidates were unable to successfully leverage them. In the suburbs of Des Moines, Iowa, candidates backed by or affiliated with the conservative activist group Moms for Liberty and far-right religious groups lost in several races to candidates endorsed by progressives and Democrats. In school districts around Overland Park, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, a bipartisan group of self-described \u201cpro-public education\u201d incumbents who supported diversity measures defeated conservative challengers. In the Philadelphia suburbs, Democrats swept the school board races in the Central Bucks and Pennridge districts, taking the majorities away from Republicans who had pushed for more conservative curricula and banned LGBTQ pride symbols. The Democratic-controlled school boards in Virginia\u2019s Loudoun and Fairfax counties, outside of Washington, D.C., had been the focal point of heated education controversies for the past two years and were featured frequently on Fox News. Both will stay in the hands of liberals; Democrats held on to a majority in Loudoun and swept all 12 seats in Fairfax, according to unofficial vote totals. \u201cThese results show people are fed up with the political attacks targeting our world-class public schools and teachers,\u201d Karl Frisch, vice chair of the Fairfax County school board, said in a statement. But liberal and moderate candidates didn\u2019t succeed everywhere. Candidates backed by Moms for Liberty chapters won school board races in Alaska, Ohio and New Jersey. The group also pointed to York County, Pennsylvania, where a slate of candidates running against the \u201cwoke virus\u201d ousted four incumbents. \u201cWould I have liked to win every race? Absolutely, I would have liked it,\u201d Tiffany Justice, Moms for Liberty\u2019s co-founder, told Steve Bannon on his streaming show Wednesday. \u201cBut am I happy that 50 seats were won? Absolutely I am,\u201d she continued, adding that the group is already preparing for 2024 and building its political action committee. Over the past three years, Republican groups have poured energy and resources into culture war disputes and propelled conservatives onto school boards, where they imposed restrictions on LGBTQ accommodations, terminated administrators and pulled books from shelves. While comprehensive national data on Tuesday\u2019s school board elections was not immediately available, the results largely reinforced recent polling suggesting lagging voter enthusiasm for these fights \u2014 in a variety of communities. Julie Marsh, an education policy professor at the University of Southern California who has studied public school disputes, said conservative losses in swing districts and red states such as Iowa and Kansas particularly reinforced this trend. \u201cI think parents are tired of talking about bathrooms, books bans and flags and pronouns,\u201d she said. Tyler Sandberg, a Republican consultant in Colorado, said private polling he\u2019s conducted shows most people do not want either left- or right-wing politics in their schools, and the races this week reflect that. \u201cWith both liberal and conservative district voters, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Cut the crap and get back to reading,\u2019\u201d Sandberg said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any fighting on culture war issues. They want good test scores. They want their kids to feel safe.\u201d Two reliably GOP districts in Colorado that elected far-right school board candidates in 2021 saw at least partial reversals this year. Douglas County, south of Denver, hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson. Two years ago, after a handful of donors pumped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to help conservatives take control of the school board, the new members quickly forced out the district\u2019s superintendent and scaled back diversity and equity efforts, prompting vehement objections from many community members. According to unofficial results in Douglas County on Thursday, a moderate slate of three school board candidates will defeat their right-wing opponents, though the seven-member board will remain in conservative control. In the mountain town of Woodland Park, Colorado \u2014 in Teller County, which supported Donald Trump over Joe Biden by 35 points \u2014 a massive door-knocking effort appears to have achieved at least one victory for the moderate slate fighting for three hotly contested seats on the five-member school board. With all of the ballots counted by Wednesday afternoon, Keegan Barkley, one of the moderates, held a 2-point lead over David Illingworth, one of the far-right incumbents. Illingworth helped lead the district\u2019s conservative push over the past two years, including for a new social studies curriculum, a gag order on staff and cuts to mental health programs. The two other school board races are separated by less than 60 votes, which could trigger automatic recounts. Elizabeth Douglas said her family canvassed for the moderate slate because seven of her 11th grade daughter\u2019s eight teachers from last school year left the district. In all, about 40% of high school staff quit before this school year, while a handful of other district employees said they were fired in retaliation for raising concerns. Last month, 81 teachers and staff members signed a letter saying the superintendent and school board were taking the schools in a direction that\u2019s \u201cunsustainable and detrimental\u201d to students and the community. Douglas said her daughter \u201cdoesn\u2019t need any kind of civics class at this point because she\u2019s gotten it firsthand.\u201d The district\u2019s superintendent has characterized criticisms as resistance to change from a small group of teachers who seek \u201ca return to sexual politics, anti-capitalism, and hatred for America.\u201d Turnout in Teller County surpassed 58% on Tuesday, compared to 38% statewide, and the total votes cast for the county\u2019s school board candidates increased by more than a third compared to 2021. Marsh, co-director of the Rossier Center on Education Policy, Equity and Governance at USC, said she hopes that with more voter participation it will be harder for a small, vocal group to control school districts, though she expects political rancor over public schools to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s over,\u201d Marsh said, \u201cbut I do think that moderate and liberal groups seem to be a little bit more engaged and savvy and not caught off guard, perhaps as they were early on a couple of years ago.\u201d Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Los Angeles.

        "title": "'We're ungovernable': House Republicans nix votes on two funding bills as shutdown deadline nears",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans closed out the week by canceling votes on two party-line funding bills in the span of 48 hours, a setback for new Speaker Mike Johnson and a sign of persisting dysfunction in the chamber ahead of a key funding deadline. They pulled a transportation-housing bill late Tuesday as some coastal Republicans opposed cuts to Amtrak. And they yanked a financial services and general government measure on Thursday morning that included divisive anti-abortion language. It's a step backward for Johnson, R-La., who had hoped to show progress on appropriations bills championed by his party's conservative wing in order to secure their votes to pass a short-term bill that would keep the government open beyond the Nov. 17 deadline. And it shows how ungovernable the House continues to be after right-wing Republicans ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy over complaints about his handling of government funding. \"I don't think the Lord Jesus himself could manage this group,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. He added that he would pray for the new speaker as the House adjourned for a long weekend. \"We\u2019re still dealing with the same divisions we always have had,\" said another House Republican. \"We\u2019re ungovernable.\" On Capitol Hill, questions abound about how the new speaker will handle his first big test in a divided government, where he must balance the demands of ultraconservatives with a Democratic-led Senate and president. \"I think there's a honeymoon period here. I'm not sure how long it lasts, maybe 30 days,\" said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. \"But with what's going on on the floor today, I think that indicates the honeymoon might be shorter than we thought.\" This week, Johnson held multiple meetings with groups of rank-and-file Republicans about a path forward on a short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR. He privately indicated his interest in a staggered bill in a meeting with allied Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., two sources said. The proposal would fund the government temporarily and impose two-tiered expiration dates: one in January and another in February. In meetings with Johnson, some members thought he'd go with a \u201cclean\u201d CR without controversial add-ons to fund the government into January, while others believed the speaker would back a similar two-step CR proposed by members of the far-right Freedom Caucus. \"He wants a simple plan that will pass the Senate,\" said moderate Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who met with Johnson on Wednesday along with roughly 20 other lawmakers. \"We should do the hard fights on appropriations and the border, and all that stuff. We shouldn't have the hard fight on the CR \u2014 let's keep the government open and make it bipartisan.\" Republicans said Johnson will need to make a call on a CR strategy by Friday to abide by the 72-hour rule, which gives lawmakers sufficient time to read the legislation before voting on it early next week. Members departed Washington on Thursday afternoon and will return on Monday. \"We've got to get the Senate something, and you'll see us get the Senate something,\" said conservative Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who met with Johnson and is pushing for the two-step process that's been termed a \"laddered CR.\" The GOP also hopes to hammer out some of its differences on the stalled spending bills and to try to move them through the chamber. Like the financial services measure, several of the remaining House appropriations bills have anti-abortion provisions, which could make it similarly difficult to win the votes of politically endangered Republicans. The issue has sparked fresh anxiety within the GOP after another poor election night earlier this week in which voters in a diverse array of states punished the party for its hard-line opposition to legal abortion. Before they pulled the financial services bill on Thursday, 165 Republicans voted for an amendment by Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., to cut White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's salary to $1. The measure failed as 54 GOP lawmakers joined Democrats to vote it down, but it revealed how an appropriations process that must be bipartisan to succeed has become a venue for partisan sniping. Conservatives also were furious over the failure of another amendment \u2014 authored by a key Trump ally, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. \u2014 that would have barred funding to acquire property for the new planned FBI headquarters. Seventy Republicans joined all but one Democrat in voting no, a roll call that came shortly after the Biden administration announced the new multi-billion-dollar complex would be built in Greenbelt, Maryland. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., poured cold water on a multi-step approach, telling reporters on Thursday a \"clean\" stopgap bill at agreed-to budget levels is \"the only way forward.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called for passing a stopgap bill \"as quickly as possible\" and emphasized on Tuesday that it must be \"bipartisan.\" But he hasn't publicly weighed in on how long he believes the funding should last. The Senate has also struggled to move appropriations bills after a strong start and a bipartisan path. It has passed just three out of 12 funding bills, fewer than the House's seven. The upper chamber's appropriations process has fallen prey to demands by conservative senators who have used their powers under Senate rules to dramatically slow things down. \"Well, I don't want a shutdown,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"And I'm very optimistic that we will avoid one.\" Asked why he's so optimistic when there's no plan, Kennedy said: \"I realize that. But it's happened before that we go up to the deadline.\" He predicted both chambers would pass a short-term bill in time. Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Nation's first openly gay governor looking to re-enter politics after nearly 20 years",
        "content": "JERSEY CITY, N.J. \u2014 The nation\u2019s first openly gay governor is looking to re-enter politics nearly 20 years after he left. Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey announced Thursday that he will seek the mayor\u2019s office in Jersey City in 2025. He made the announcement in a video posted online and planned to formally launch his campaign with a news conference later in the day. McGreevey, a Democrat, is a former Woodbridge Township mayor who was elected governor in 2002. He announced in August 2004 that he was \u201ca gay American\u201d and acknowledged having an extramarital affair with a male staffer. He resigned that year. \u201cI was imperfect and I\u2019ll always be imperfect,\u201d McGreevey, 66, said at the start of the video, which shows him watching a portion of his resignation announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s important to take responsibility and do the next right thing.\u201d After leaving office, McGreevey founded the New Jersey Reentry Corporation, which provides job training, counseling and many other services to people who are released from prison and returning to communities they may have left decades before. McGreevey is the first to announce his run for mayor. He\u2019s hoping to succeed three-term Mayor Steve Fulop, who has already announced he\u2019s running for governor in 2025. Jersey City, located across the Hudson River from New York City, has about 284,000 residents and is the state\u2019s second-most populous city. ",

        "title": "Inspectors find rats, moldy food and leaky roofs at federal women's prison in Florida",
        "content": "A surprise inspection at a federal women\u2019s prison in Florida found a rat infestation, leaking roofs and inmates being served moldy bread, according to a report issued Wednesday by the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog that investigators say speaks to long-standing and persistent management challenges at the agency that houses federal inmates.  Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in an exclusive interview that his investigators were shocked at what they discovered during the inspection in May at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, which houses 746 women and 115 men.  Horowitz said a surprise inspection in January at a Minnesota prison also found substandard conditions, and he said both findings are symptomatic of a federal prison system beset by underfunding, staff shortages and mismanagement. The federal Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department, spends about $8.4 billion a year to house around 158,000 inmates. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 11 years as IG. The current BoP director is my eighth director that I\u2019ve dealt with during that time.\u201d Horowitz credited the Justice Department leadership with trying to fix some of the long-standing problems. But, he said, the conditions his investigators discovered in Tallahassee show how much work still needs to be done.  \u201cWhat we found was stunning,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we saw in the facility was not in any way conditions that anybody should live in. We saw a shower with pooled water that was black. We saw black spots on walls, which looked to be consistent with mold.\u201d Horowitz added, \u201cWe saw inmates being served, in their regular meal, bread that had mold on it. We saw evidence of rodent droppings. We saw bugs crawling on cereal boxes. We saw warped food containers, food in there that should never be served to anybody.\u201d He said that he\u2019s been documenting bad management and awful conditions at federal prisons for more than a decade, and not much has changed. High-profile inmates have died on the Bureau of Prisons' watch, including sex offender and accused trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide, and mob boss Whitey Bulger, who was murdered. Horowitz investigated both cases and found that both were linked to massive failures by the federal agency. \u201cWhen this happens, there are huge repercussions,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Epstein\u2019s case, it resulted in victims not having the chance to testify at trial, and to see him have to stand trial on those charges.\u201d Last year, a Senate investigation found rampant sexual abuse of female prisoners by male prison guards. \u201cIt\u2019s been very concerning and frustrating to my staff,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cWe do investigations over and over again, of misconduct, criminal actions, by staff on inmates \u2026 Our reviews keep finding the same problems over and over again.\u201d The Bureau of Prisons said in a statement, \"The Federal Bureau of Prisons expresses its sincere appreciation for the valuable work accomplished by the Office of Inspector General in all the essential areas highlighted in this report.  While no specific recommendations were made, the FBOP will carefully evaluate and implement any necessary corrective actions to ensure that our mission of operating safe, secure, and humane facilities continues to be fulfilled.\" Collette Peters, appointed earlier this year as the new bureau chief, told Congress recently that she is setting a new tone.  \u201cWe are now guided by the principles of normalcy and humanity and core values that emphasize accountability, integrity, respect, compassion and correctional excellence,\u201d she said. Americans should care about how federal prisons treat inmates, Horowitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s been said by many people \u2014 including by Nelson Mandela, famously \u2014 that you can judge a society by how you treat your inmates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd looking at this, this is no way to treat inmates \u2026 It\u2019s a basic human rights issue. We shouldn\u2019t have to go into a prison and see food being served like this. We shouldn\u2019t go and walk into the housing facilities and see a shower with water pool that\u2019s black in it. We shouldn\u2019t want to see prisons that are leaking and that the female inmates have to use feminine hygiene products to try and keep the water off their beds and off their facilities.\u201d Ken Dilanian is the justice and intelligence correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

        "title": "Michigan judge hears arguments on efforts to keep Trump off the ballot",
        "content": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 A judge in Michigan is hearing arguments Thursday on whether Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has the authority to keep Donald Trump\u2019s name off state ballots for president. Activists are suing Benson in the Michigan Court of Claims to force her to keep Trump\u2019s name off ballots and to assess Trump\u2019s constitutional qualifications to serve a second term as president. Meanwhile, attorneys for the former president are demanding that Trump\u2019s name be allowed on the 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot. Arguments began Thursday morning in Grand Rapids before Judge James Robert Redford told an activist in one case, an attorney representing Benson\u2019s office and lawyers representing Trump that \u201cwhatever happens in these cases ... it will happen relatively quickly.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t happen today or this afternoon,\u201d Redford added. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling from the bench.\u201d Redford alluded to expecting some type of appeal. \u201cI fully recognize I am not the last word on whatever happens in this case,\u201d he said. Activists in two separate suits point to a section of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment that prohibits a person from running for federal office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the U.S. or given aid or comfort to those who have. Liberal groups also have filed lawsuits in Colorado and Minnesota to bar Trump from the ballot, portraying him as the inciter of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was intended to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential election win. The groups cite a rarely used constitutional prohibition against holding office for those who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution but then \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d against it. The two-sentence clause in the 14th Amendment has been used only a handful of times since the years after the Civil War. But the Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit citing the provision. The court\u2019s ruling said its decision applied only to the state\u2019s primary. Free Speech For People, a group representing petitioners before the Minnesota Supreme Court, also represents petitioners in one of the Michigan cases against Benson. Trump is considered the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Benson has already said in a filing that Michigan\u2019s Legislature does not give her the authority to determine whether a candidate for president may be disqualified for the state ballot under the 14th Amendment or to assess a candidate\u2019s constitutional qualifications to serve as president. It\u2019s a \u201cfederal constitutional question of enormous consequence\u201d whether Trump cannot appear as a presidential candidate on state ballots, Benson wrote. \u201cMichigan courts have held that administrative agencies generally do not have the power to determine constitutional questions.\u201d However, she said that she will follow the direction of the court either way.

        "title": "Paul Pelosi attack suspect's federal trial begins in San Francisco",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The man accused of breaking into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s San Francisco home, bludgeoning her husband with a hammer and seeking to kidnap her went on trial Thursday. Opening statements started in the federal trial of David DePape who prosecutors say assaulted then-82-year-old Paul Pelosi, sending shockwaves through the political world just days before last year\u2019s midterm elections. The attack in the early hours of Oct. 28, 2022, also highlighted how conspiracy theories and misinformation that spread online can fuel political violence. DePape pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. Paul Pelosi is expected to testify next week. DePape posted rants on a blog and an online forum about aliens, communists, religious minorities, and global elites. He questioned the results of the 2020 election and echoed the baseless, right-wing QAnon conspiracy theory that claims the U.S. government is run by a cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles. The websites were taken down shortly after his arrest. A Canadian citizen, DePape moved to the United States more than 20 years ago after falling in love with Gypsy Taub, a Berkeley pro-nudity activist well-known in the Bay Area, his stepfather, Gene DePape said. In recent years, David DePape had been homeless and struggling with drug abuse and mental illness, Taub told local media. Federal prosecutors say DePape smashed his shoulder through a glass panel on a door in the back of the Pelosis\u2019 Pacific Heights mansion and confronted a sleeping Paul Pelosi, who was wearing boxer shorts and a pajama top. \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d DePape asked, standing over Paul Pelosi around 2 a.m. holding a hammer and zip ties, according to court records. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington and under the protection of her security detail, which does not extend to family members. Paul Pelosi called 911 and two San Francisco Police officers showed up and witnessed DePape strike Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer, knocking him unconscious, court records showed. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband of 60 years later underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands. After his arrest, DePape, 43, allegedly told a San Francisco detective that he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage. He said that if she told him the truth, he would let her go and if she lied, he was going to \u201cbreak her kneecaps\u201d to show other members of Congress there were \u201cconsequences to actions,\u201d according to prosecutors. A backpack DePape was carrying had tape and a rope, in addition to zip ties, according to police. The assault was captured on the officers\u2019 body cameras. U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled last month that the jury will be allowed to see footage that shows Paul Pelosi in a pool of his own blood struggling to breathe and the police officers trying to stop the bleeding. Angela Chuang, one of DePape\u2019s federal public defenders, had argued that the shocking footage would be prejudicial to her client. Corley also ruled jurors can listen to portions of a 5-minute call DePape made in January to a television reporter in which he repeated conspiracy theories. \u201cFreedom and liberty isn\u2019t dying, it\u2019s being killed systematically and deliberately,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tree of liberty needs watering. He needs men of valor, patriots willing to put their own lives on the line to stand in opposition to tyranny,\u201d he added. Katherine Keneally, a senior researcher at the nonprofit Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said the attack is an example of increasing online hate, conspiracies and false narratives influencing political violence. \u201cThis didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum,\u201d Keneally said. Keneally said people who commit such conspiracy-fueled acts of violence often are struggling with mental health or other life crises, such as the death of a family member or a divorce. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single case where someone engaged in violent behavior where they were solely influenced by the conspiracy theory,\u201d she said. DePape, who lived in a garage in the Bay Area city of Richmond and had been doing odd carpentry jobs to support himself, allegedly told authorities he had other targets, including a women\u2019s and queer studies professor, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, actor Tom Hanks and President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. One of those targets is included in the defense\u2019s short witness list, though their name has been redacted. The other possible witnesses are DePape, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s chief of staff, Daniel Bernal, extremism and antisemitism researcher Elizabeth Yates, and federal public defender Catherine Goulet. The prosecution\u2019s list of potential witnesses contains 15 names, including the surgeon who operated on Paul Pelosi, federal agents, San Francisco police officers and several first responders. If convicted, DePape faces life in prison. He was also charged in state court with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. He pleaded not guilty to those charges. A state trial has not been scheduled. ",

        "title": "Democrats' plan to issue subpoenas in Supreme Court ethics probe hits roadblock",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday delayed a vote on issuing subpoenas to two influential conservatives as part of its investigation into alleged ethics lapses on the Supreme Court. The committee was expected to vote on subpoenas for billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow and conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, but the meeting was abruptly adjourned. It is unclear when the votes will take place. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the committee, said afterward that the vote was delayed because Republicans had filed 88 amendments at the last minute that Democrats had not yet had time to properly review. \"We just didn't have time,\" he added. Durbin said Democrats are \"still united\" on issuing the subpoenas. The push for tighter ethics rules on the court has become a partisan fight, with Republicans adamant that Democrats are trying to delegitimize the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. Republicans welcomed Thursday's developments, saying they hoped it meant that the subpoenas will not be issued at all. \"I'm hopeful that maybe we will not get engaged in the subpoena wars,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. He and other Republicans had been poised to propose subpoenas on a range of other issues in protest of the Democrats' plan. \"Once you open this door, it's hard to close,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Democrats, who are considering legislation imposing a binding ethics code on the justices, say the subpoenas are needed because Crow and Leo failed to respond sufficiently to the committee's inquiries. A plan to also issue a subpoena for GOP donor Robin Arkley II was dropped, with Durbin announcing Wednesday that Arkley had provided the information that had been requested. Durbin said Leo \"has refused to cooperate in any way\" and that Crow, although he has said he was willing to work with the committee, \"made only a limited and insufficient offer.\" The testimony is being sought in light of media reports about conservative justices accepting free hospitality and travel without properly disclosing it. Although Supreme Court justices submit annual financial disclosure reports, they are not bound by the same ethics code that applies to lower court judges. In April, ProPublica reported that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted trips funded by Crow without disclosing them. In June, it reported that Justice Samuel Alito took an undisclosed fishing trip to Alaska in 2008 with Arkley that was coordinated by Leo. Thomas said in response that under the disclosure rules in place at the time he did not think he had to disclose the trips. Alito defended his actions in an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal. The disclosure rules were updated this year to tighten the definition of personal hospitality. Thomas in his latest report disclosed trips in 2022 paid for by Crow. Several justices have signaled support for the court adopting its own ethics rules and Chief Justice John Roberts has indicated the justices are working on it. Alito has questioned whether Congress has the authority to legislate on the issue. Although the committee only needs a simple majority to issue the subpoenas, enforcing them is another matter. If Crow and Leo do not comply, the full Senate would have to vote on it. Republicans would likely be able to defeat such an effort, as it would require 60 votes. Democrats narrowly control the chamber, 51-49. Lawrence Hurley covers the Supreme Court for NBC News.

        "title": "The White House wants to own Tuesday's election wins. Democrats aren't so sure.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Joe Biden didn\u2019t campaign for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. The president did not even step foot in the ruby-red state in the countdown to Election Day. Yet touting Beshear\u2019s win on Wednesday, Biden\u2019s press secretary argued that the Democratic governor prevailed not in spite of the president, but thanks to him. Karine Jean-Pierre said Beshear\u2019s Republican opponent spent millions tying the governor to Biden, meaning \u201cthe president was injected into that conversation, into that election.\u201d Central to the effort were his attacks on the \u201cBiden-Beshear agenda.\u201d It's a claim the White House was happy to own. \u201cBeshear ran on infrastructure, he ran on lowering costs,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"Those are the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Kentucky where Democrats did well on Tuesday. Democrats in Virginia flipped the House of Delegates, taking control of the state\u2019s Legislature and dealing a blow to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Ohio voted by more than 13 percentage points to enshrine abortion protections in the state\u2019s constitution, a victory for activists in the Republican-leaning state. Democrats expanded their majority in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and added seats in the New Jersey Legislature. Jean-Pierre said these are the indicators that matter, not the surveys one year out that have prompted handwringing inside the party ahead of a presidential race where Biden is expected to face off against Donald Trump again. \u201cWe have always said that voting matters and polls do not,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. The Biden campaign has acknowledged that they expect the race to be a close election. Democrats who fear a worst-case scenario next year are drawing different lessons from Beshear\u2019s victory. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a governor who\u2019s extremely well liked,\u201d a Kentucky Democratic strategist said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different than where Biden is, not to mention the polling that just came out of five of the swing states.\u201d And while \u201cit\u2019s a win for Democrats, it\u2019s not like the president\u2019s name was on the ballot,\u201d said one senior Democratic aide for a lawmaker in a swing state where Biden barely eked out a victory in the last election. \u201cYou look at Andy Beshear; he\u2019s a young guy, he didn\u2019t sell out on abortion or trans rights, and he won \u2018bigly.\u2019 And his name is not Joe Biden.\u201d A New York Times/Siena College poll published over the weekend showed Biden trailing Trump in states the president won in 2020, drawing concerns that the president\u2019s re-election campaign was in need of a \u201cdefibrillator.\u201d Voters cite Biden\u2019s age as a major factor. A second Kentucky strategist sounded a note of caution. \u201cTheir internal polls had him in double digits,\u201d this person said of Beshear.  Some party operatives were turned off by Biden\u2019s team taking credit for the 2023 election results. Plenty of Democrats are \u201cirritated by the chest-thumping and celebrating\u201d from the Biden campaign after Tuesday night, said one Democratic operative, who argued that \u201clast night wasn\u2019t a win for Biden.\u201d  Beshear\u2019s success \u201cshows how we should be running someone like him instead,\u201d this person said. There are caveats to how much Democrats should be celebrating as they look ahead to 2024, analysts warned. While Democrats have built a durable coalition among voters who regularly turn out, surveys show Biden\u2019s main problems are with irregular voters who have been essential to Democratic success in recent presidential elections. \u201cBiden\u2019s numbers among the kinds of voters who only show up in presidential elections are much weaker,\u201d said David Wasserman, an election analyst at the Cook Political Report. \u201cThe voters who did not show up yesterday but will in 2024 skew younger, they skew noncollege, a little bit more nonwhite than the electorate overall, and they skew independent. Those voters in surveys are quite anti-Biden at the moment, and are surprisingly open to voting to Trump.\u201d And Biden must win in key swing states to hold onto office.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a national election; we have battleground states,\u201d a Democratic operative and veteran of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns warned. \u201cYou can throw conventional wisdom out the window.\u201d  But this person said Obama faced a grim economic picture as he ran for re-election, and suggested this could provide comfort to Biden as he contends with voters\u2019 deeply pessimistic view of the economy.  \u201cWe had it a lot worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThose numbers were tough in 2011. And we managed to overcome that.\u201d A year out from the 2012 election, polls showed Obama trailing Republican Mitt Romney, including in some battlegrounds. Kentucky strategists said they worked to keep the race focused on local issues and maintaining close ties to voters.  \u201cWe wanted this race to be about Kentucky and keep it Beshear versus [Daniel] Cameron, because we knew that if it was Beshear versus Cameron we were going to win,\u201d a third Kentucky operative said. \u201cCameron \u2014 there was nothing positive about what he was going to do. It was all about stopping Andy and stopping 'Bidenomics,' or whatever he was calling it. There was really no plan, and it just didn\u2019t resonate.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run on pocketbook issues,\u201d added Jared Smith, who ran Beshear\u2019s successful attorney general campaign in 2015.   One progressive leader urged the party not to take the wrong lessons from Tuesday. \u201cJust like 2022, Democrats are jubilant about victories that happened despite Joe Biden, not because of Joe Biden,\u201d this person said. \u201cWe still have a problem at the top of the ticket \u2014 an unliked president who is not able to use the bully pulpit to inspire people on domestic issues and who seems weak in the Middle East conflict.\u201d Responding to the criticism, Andrew Bates, White House deputy press secretary, said Democrats should stop their bellyaches.  \"That would be news to Daniel Cameron, who spent over $30 million running against the \u2018Biden Beshear Agenda\u2019 and made opposition to the President the centerpiece of his closing argument before losing to \u2018Bidenomics\u2019 \u2014 his words \u2014 and reproductive rights in a deeply conservative state. It would also be news to the Associated Press, who wrote, 'Biden gets boost with election wins on abortion rights, Kentucky governor vote,'\" Bates said. \"For whoever said that, there\u2019s a good Harvey Keitel quote: \u2018Are you such a f------ loser, you can\u2019t tell when you\u2019ve won?'\" Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment for this article.  Still, the hunger for alternatives to Biden has some in the party training their sights on Beshear as a future standard-bearer for a Democratic coalition that can win over swing voters while holding firm on issues such as abortion. \u201cAndy should run for president. Now,\u201d the senior aide to a battleground Democrat said. Biden won \u201cby the skin of his teeth\u201d in key swing states in 2020, the aide said, arguing that Democrats should nominate someone who shows promise for charting a new course for the party instead of threatening retreat.  \"Looking at Ohio, these issues are popular. But the messenger isn\u2019t popular.\" SENIOR AIDE TO A DEMOCRAT IN A SWING STATE \u201cAndy would destroy Trump, on optics alone,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe looks good on stage, he sounds good \u2014 doesn\u2019t sound like he has dementia. It\u2019s like, \u2018OK, he\u2019s from Kentucky, he can\u2019t be that radical.\u2019 Boom. All of a sudden we win Ohio, too, and then we expand the Senate.\u201d The aide warned of an enthusiasm gap, reflected in exit polling where voters otherwise aligned with Biden say they would prefer another candidate to lead a presidential ticket next year. In Ohio, only 38% of those who voted to enshrine abortion rights said Biden should run for re-election, according to exit polls. Of those who voted against the referendum, 64% said Trump should run again.  \u201cLooking at Ohio, these issues are popular. But the messenger isn\u2019t popular,\u201d the Democratic aide said. Already, the win in Kentucky has donors wondering how they can boost Beshear\u2019s national prospects, operatives said, turbocharging background chatter over what a future ticket could look like.  \u201cI\u2019m getting phone calls asking me what to do to start raising money for him,\u201d said the first Kentucky strategist. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve got to get through 2024.\u201d Future-casting aside, others inside the party have questioned how best to persuade voters of Biden\u2019s message.   Speaking at a panel discussion Tuesday night at Georgetown University, Patti Solis Doyle called \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d the fact that Biden\u2019s message \u201cis not resonating,\u201d and wondered aloud if voters were failing to hear it for reasons outside the president\u2019s control. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to get cut out of the Democratic Party for saying this, but \u2026 he\u2019s old,\u201d said Solis Doyle, who ran Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2008. \u201cAnd that overarching issue is clouding everything else, and people cannot see past it. Our voters cannot see past it. And it\u2019s a problem.\u201d With roughly a year until Election Day, Biden has allies who say he deserves to bask in Democrats\u2019 successes after laying the groundwork. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States, he absolutely should be taking credit,\u201d Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of not only our country, but of our party, and he has been delivering in all these areas. \u2026 We\u2019re a team. We\u2019re literally fighting, quite literally for people\u2019s freedoms. And we\u2019re winning.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, called Tuesday\u2019s results \u201ca validation\u201d of Biden\u2019s agenda and said the president understands his base.  Biden \u201cgets all politics is local as well as national,\u201d Murphy said. Murphy dismissed as \u201cchoppy and/or muddled\u201d recent polling that shows Biden trailing Trump in all but one swing state. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lead-lag factor. This is ultimately going to sort itself out,\u201d he said. Still, Solis Doyle said the party is divided over the conflict in Gaza, which bodes poorly heading into an election year. \u201cWe did vote for Joe Biden because he was going to be the boring president. He was going to provide stability and predictability,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re waking up three years later with wars and there\u2019s a lot of chaos.\u201d  Some Democrats believe a Biden-led ticket is matched only by voters aversion to his predecessor \u2014 a potential bright spot, with Trump holding a double-digit polling lead as the current Republican front-runner.  \u201cIt\u2019s a rematch nobody wants,\u201d said the second Kentucky operative. \u201cThe sense is anybody but Biden and Trump.\u201d Katherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Trump family takes the stand: Angry outbursts, memory lapses and 'gotcha' moments from the civil fraud trial",
        "content": "Four members of the Trump family, including the former president, testified over the past week in the $250 million civil fraud case that could inflict serious damage on their family company. The remarkable spectacle of five days of testimony from the former first family inside Judge Arthur Engoron\u2019s New York courtroom included angry outbursts from Donald Trump, memory lapses from his three oldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump \u2014 and even some \u201cgotcha\u201d-style moments that could ultimately figure into the judge\u2019s verdict. Only Ivanka Trump, a former senior executive at the Trump Organization who was let out of the case as a defendant by an appeals court, was cross-examined by Trump's lawyers. Trump and his oldest sons, who both now run the company, are expected to be called back as witnesses after the defense begins presenting its case next week. Trump attorney Chris Kise said Thursday that Trump Jr. would be their first witness. Here\u2019s a look at some key moments from their testimony so far. The former president has been highly critical of state Attorney General Letitia James for bringing the fraud suit against him, his family and his company, and of the judge for his rulings in the case. Trump kept up those attacks on the witness stand, repeatedly blasting both. \u201cI think she\u2019s a political hack,\u201d Trump said of James, calling it \u201ca disgrace that a case like this is going on.\u201d \u2018This is a political witch hunt, and I think she should be ashamed of herself,\u201d he said. Trump also complained mightily about Engoron, who will be determining his company\u2019s fate, and took aim at the judge\u2019s pretrial ruling finding Trump liable for \u201cpersistent fraud\u201d for grossly overinflating his assets in financial statements. Trump called him a \u201cvery hostile judge, extremely hostile judge.\u201d \u201cHe ruled against me and he said I was a fraud before he knew anything about me, nothing about me,\u201d Trump said of Engoron, who has overseen legal disputes between Trump and the attorney general\u2019s office for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing you did. You knew nothing about me. You believed this political hack back there,\u201d he told the judge, referring to James, who was sitting in the audience. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d The sight of a defendant verbally attacking a judge without any repercussions was unusual on its own, but after complaints from James\u2019 office that Trump was giving speeches instead of answering questions, Trump lawyer Kise argued his client should be given leeway to answer questions however he sees fit. \u201cI think the court should grant the former president of the United States \u2014 and according to The New York Times this morning, perhaps soon to be the future president of the United States \u2014 a little latitude to explain himself,\u201d Kise said. Engoron was unmoved. \u201cSo, Mr. Trump, just answer the question. You can attack me, you can do whatever you want, but answer the questions,\u201d the judge said. At another point, Kise told the judge he should just listen to what his client has to say. Engoron told him Trump\u2019s appearance was \u201cnot a political rally.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not here to hear what he has to say,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI\u2019m here to hear him answer questions.\u201d While the attorney general's office has accused Trump of inflating his annual statements of financial condition by up to $2 billion a year, Trump maintained that any errors in the statements were \"nonmaterial.\" \"I think that the statements of financial condition were very good, were actually somewhat conservative and in some cases very conservative,\" Trump said, adding some properties were worth even more than what was listed in his financial statements. He said the documents were prepared by his accountants. \"I mean, people don\u2019t know how good a company I built. You know why? Because people like you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me,\" Trump told lawyer Kevin Wallace with the attorney general's office. Trump also maintained that the financial statements at the heart of the attorney general's case were irrelevant because banks and insurers don't really rely on them for anything. \"Yeah, I would look at them. It was not something that was of great urgency,\" he said, referring to the statements. \"It just wasn\u2019t very important. You have made it important, but it wasn\u2019t important. It wasn\u2019t important financially,\" he added. Trump made repeated references to what he called a \"disclaimer clause\" or \"worthless statement clause\" in the financial statements that advises that different people may reach different conclusions about the values in it. He said it holds that people should do their own \"due diligence.\" Engoron had already shot down that defense in a pretrial ruling in September, finding the clause wasn't as broad as Trump was claiming. He told Trump, \"If you want to know about the disclaimer clause, read my opinion again, or for the first time, perhaps.\" \"Well, you are wrong on the opinion,\" Trump shot back. For a case where he's accused of being sloppy with his financial estimates, Trump didn't seem too concerned with numerical precision. After saying the value of his Mar-a-Lago club was lower on his financial forms than it should have been \u2014 the AG maintained it was massively overvalued and falsely portrayed as being able to be used as a single residence \u2014 Trump offered his own widely ranging current estimates. \"The judge had it at $18 million. And it is worth, say, I say from 50 to 100 times more than that. So I don\u2019t know how you got those numbers,\" Trump said. Later, he was asked if he'd previously said the property, which has been assessed for tax purposes at between $18 million and $28 million, was worth $1.5 billion. \"I think between a billion and a billion five,\" Trump answered. Trump ceded control of his company to Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and then-Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg when he entered the White House. Documents shown during Donald Trump Jr.'s testimony showed the senior Trump reclaimed control of the trust that owned the property on Jan. 15, 2021 \u2014 five days before he left office. Trump stepped down and made Trump Jr. the trustee again on July 7, 2021, according to documents the attorney general's office showed in court. That was just days after Weisselberg and the company were hit with tax fraud charges by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Wallace, of the AG's office, asked Trump if there was \"anything in particular\" that was \"happening in July of 2021 that led to that decision.\" \"Well other than you and about every other Democrat, district attorney, AG and U.S. attorneys, et cetera, were coming after me from 15 different sides, all Democrats, all Trump haters \u2014 and all cases that are not good, that are inappropriate and not good. Weaponization they call it. But I felt Donald would do a good job. He would be running the business with Eric. And I had great confidence in him,\" Trump said. Weisselberg later pleaded guilty to the charges and the company was convicted at trial. Trump praised his sons early on in his testimony. Asked why he made Trump Jr. a trustee of his trust when he went into the White House, Trump said, \"He is a hardworking boy, you know, young man, and he has done a very good job; as has Eric. Eric was very busy running the company, and I thought that putting Don in would be good. He is smart. He is a very honorable guy.\" The attorney general's office grilled the Trump children on phone calls, conversations and emails in some cases going back over 10 years. The most common responses to those questions were that they could not remember anything about them. Each of the adult children offered dozens of variations of \"I don't remember\" or \"I don't recall\" during their testimony. The AG's office was clearly skeptical of some of those answers during Eric Trump's testimony, including when he was asked about a 2021 a video phone call he had with his brother and others about the financial statements after they were already aware of the AG's investigation. Pressed about the call on his second day on the witness stand, Eric Trump said, \"I\u2019m testifying that I don\u2019t recall a specific call out of thousands of calls on every single day. There isn\u2019t a question there were conversations in the organization about the statement of financial condition after this action started.\" Eric Trump maintained early in his testimony that he had never seen or worked on the company's financial statements prior to taking over. \"I don't believe I would have had knowledge of it,\" he said, adding later that \"I didn't know anything about it really until this case came into fruition.\" Andrew Amer of the AG's office then presented him with emails showing he had used his father's financial statements in connection with a deal he was working on in 2012, and another showing a Trump Organization executive asking him to weigh in on the valuation of a specific property for the statement the next year. \"So you did know about your father's annual financial statement as of Aug. 20, 2013, didn't you?\" Amer asked. \"It appears that way, yes,\" he replied. He was then shown emails where he was asked for information for the statements in future years as well. When Donald Trump was in the White House, the financial statements were signed by the Trump sons. They both testified they had little to nothing to do with the statements before that, and that they essentially rubber-stamped them when they were in charge. Trump Jr. said he didn't question the figures in the statements because they came from the accounting firm they'd hired. \"I rely on the accountants,\" he said. \"They were intimately involved in every aspect\" of the statements. Asked about what due diligence he performed on the financial statements, Eric Trump said, \"I relied on a very big accounting office. I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team, and when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute it.\" Ivanka Trump said she was not involved with her father's financial statements and had no insight into how they were prepared. \"I would assume he would have personal financial statements that he would work on with his own accountants, but those weren't things that I was privy to,\" she said, adding that \"it was not something that I was involved in.\" Dareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "House Republicans urge Biden to make demands of Xi Jinping ahead of meeting next week",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans on the House Select Committee on China sent a letter Wednesday to President Joe Biden ahead of his scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week, urging him to shift policy toward China and \u201cchallenge Beijing\u201d to prove that it wants to improve relations with the U.S. Committee Chair Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who led the letter, outlined demands that Biden should make to Xi, which include stemming the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, releasing Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai and others held by China, as well as ending near-collisions between Chinese and U.S. warships. \u201cIf Xi fails to deliver, your administration must end its pursuit of zombie engagement and shift gears to a more assertive posture in order to defend American interests and values,\u201d committee Republicans wrote. Biden and Xi are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco next week. The last time the two spoke was in November 2022 in Bali, Indonesia, at a summit of the Group of 20 economies. Details about Biden\u2019s meeting with Xi have not yet been announced. The meeting comes after the president met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the White House last month. Republicans on the China committee said they agree with the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cdesire to deter a devastating conflict\u201d with China but expressed concerns that the U.S. has made too many concessions while not demanding enough from China. Specifically, Republicans criticized Biden for not sanctioning Chinese officials for the \u201cerosion of Hong Kong\u2019s authority\u201d or for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, in western China, which the U.S. and other Western governments have said amounts to genocide. The letter was signed by all 13 Republicans on the committee.

        "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in blistering remarks at Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, making a Nazi reference and calling Zelenskyy a \"comedian in cargo pants.\" During an exchange about whether he would support sending additional support to Ukraine, Ramaswamy, an aggressive critic of U.S. aid in the war between Ukraine and Russia, said he was \u201cabsolutely unpersuaded\u201d by Zelenskyy\u2019s calls for more help, before he launched into a sharply worded broadside against Zelenskyy and his government. \u201cUkraine is not a paragon of democracy,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cIt has threatened not to hold elections this year unless the U.S. forks over more money. That is not democratic.\u201d \u201cIt has celebrated a Nazi in its ranks, the comedian in cargo pants, the man called Zelenskyy, doing it in their own ranks\u201d Ramaswamy continued. \u201cThat is not democratic.\u201d Campaign spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News that Ramaswamy had not called Zelenskyy a \"Nazi\" and that his remarks were in reference to an incident in September in Canada, when the country\u2019s parliament held a celebration of a Ukrainian Canadian veteran who was later discovered to have served in a Nazi-aligned military unit. Zelenskyy was at the celebration, which happened before the revelation, and he joined in a standing ovation honoring the man. McLaughlin said Ramaswamy had been referring to Zelenskyy\u2019s participation in the celebration. \"Vivek makes controversial assertions all the time,\" McLaughlin said. \"This one is just not true.\" A moment earlier, Ramaswamy touted his own position against helping Ukraine in its war, saying he was \u201cactually enjoying watching the Ukraine hawks quietly, delicately tiptoe back from their position as this thing has unwound into a disaster.\u201d Ramaswamy has been a staunch critic of U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine, and he spoke about it more Wednesday night as the debate focused heavily on foreign policy. Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, has said his great-grandparents were killed when the Nazis set their village on fire during World War II.  Adam Edelman is a political reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Over 1 in 4 Americans will be Latino by 2060, Census projects",
        "content": "The U.S. Latino population, now about 1 in 5 Americans, is projected to continue increasing through the year 2060, when over 1 in 4 Americans are likely to be Latino, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections released Thursday. Hispanics are now 19.1% of the U.S. population but are projected to make up 26.9% of the population in less than four decades. Meanwhile, the non-Hispanic white population is projected to continue to decline from 58.9% now to 44.9% by 2060. Overall, the U.S. population is projected to continue to grow from 333 million today to a high of nearly 370 million in 2080, but then dip downward to 366 million in the year 2100. The projections are an update from those last issued by the Census Bureau in 2017. The numbers issued Thursday incorporated data on births, deaths and international migration, leading to a slower pace of population growth than previously projected, Census Bureau demographer Sandra Johnson stated in a news release. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. \u201cThe U.S. has experienced notable shifts in the components of population change over the last five years,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these, like the increases in mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, are expected to be short-term while others, including the declines in fertility that have persisted for decades, are likely to continue into the future.\" The bureau issued four sets of projections for the overall population based on different scenarios. They refer to the four projections as the middle series or the most likely projections; the high immigration scenario; the low immigration scenario; and the far less likely zero-immigration scenario. In every scenario, drops in fertility and an aging population will lead to more deaths than births in the U.S. That is expected to happen in 2038 in the most likely projections; in 2036 in the low immigration scenario; and in 2042 in the high immigration scenario. In the zero-immigration scenario, it happens in 2033. Because the U.S. is projected to have more deaths than births, immigration is projected to be the largest contributor to population growth. In the high immigration scenario, the U.S. population reaches 435 million by 2100. In the most likely projections, the population peaks at 370 million in 2080, then drops to 366 million in 2100. The low-immigration scenario is projected to peak at around 346 million in 2043 and decline thereafter, dropping to 319 million in 2100.

        "title": "The war for second place got hot, but the third GOP debate didn't dent Trump",
        "content": "MIAMI \u2014 Former President Donald Trump's top two rivals for the Republican nomination criticized him gingerly at an NBC News debate here Wednesday night as they continued to separate themselves from the rest of the field. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley sparred with each other but tiptoed around Trump \u2014 leaving open the stubborn question of how either of them plans to threaten his wide lead in national and state polls. \"Both candidates looked prepared to govern the country in serious times,\" Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett said. \"We are now getting to a point where the GOP has to decide if they want to nominate a legitimate candidate for president or an inflammatory personality who may be a political opioid of the right-wing masses as they march toward yet another loss at the ballot box.\" So far, the answer has been Trump. For the third time in three debates, Trump skipped the stage. Instead, Trump, who regularly beats DeSantis by 35 percentage points or more and Haley by larger margins in national polls, held a raucous rally in nearby Hialeah on Wednesday night. Yet DeSantis and Haley both offered contrasts with Trump that were tame \u2014 certainly less bombastic than the ways he attacks them. \"Donald Trump\u2019s a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance,\" DeSantis said. \"He should explain why he didn\u2019t have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he racked up so much debt. He should explain why he didn\u2019t drain the swamp.\" And, DeSantis added, Trump promised Republicans would get tired of winning, but Tuesday's off-year elections showed that's not happening. \"I\u2019m sick of Republicans losing,\" he said. Haley was even less aggressive in her criticism. \"I can tell you that I think he was the right president at the right time. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right president now,\" she said. \"I think that he put us $8 trillion in debt, and our kids are never going to forgive us for that. I think the fact that he used to be right on Ukraine and foreign issues, now he\u2019s getting weak in the knees and trying to be friendly again.\" Two other candidates, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina \u2014 the competitors who are polling the worst \u2014 receded into the background at times. Vivek Ramaswamy, a first-time candidate, might have suffered the same fate had he not fired rhetorical rockets at DeSantis, Haley and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who wasn't onstage. But Ramaswamy's attacks on fellow candidates \u2014 and Haley's daughter \u2014 didn't go over well in the debate hall at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts. Haley called Ramaswamy \"scum\" for mentioning her daughter. She and DeSantis tussled with each other twice, with DeSantis getting the better of Haley on China and Haley getting in a dig on energy policy. \"She welcomed them into South Carolina, gave them land near a military base,\" DeSantis said of development incentives South Carolina gave a Chinese company when Haley was governor. He added that she \"wrote the Chinese ambassador a love letter saying what a great friend they were.\" Later, Haley pushed back when DeSantis proclaimed his favor for energy exploration, noting his effort to stop hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Everglades. She admonished him for trying to \"act like you weren't a liberal\" on the issue. \"You always have been. Just own it if that\u2019s the case, but don\u2019t keep saying you\u2019re something that you\u2019re not,\" she said. But on most of the questions asked by moderators Lester Holt and Kristen Welker of NBC News and Hugh Hewitt of Salem Radio Network, there were few major substantive differences between Haley and DeSantis. For example, they both expressed unflinching support for Israel in its war with Hamas, promised to fight drug cartels \u2014 including using military force \u2014 and suggested they prefer that abortion restrictions be dealt with at the state level. Their allies even had the same reaction to the political meaning of the debate: each side proclaiming its own candidate as the clear second to Trump. The dynamic only reinforced Trump's dominance over the field and the inability of DeSantis and Haley to shake each other. Former Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, a onetime rival who has endorsed Haley, said shots at her from DeSantis and Ramaswamy affirm the surge she has seen in state polls, in which she is now tied with DeSantis for second in Iowa and alone in second in New Hampshire and South Carolina. \"Well, the fact that everybody went and attacked Ambassador Haley tonight is a sign that they recognize that her rise is real, that this is really boiling down to a one-on-one with Donald Trump and Nikki Haley,\u201d Hurd said. Likewise, DeSantis allies were encouraged by his debate performance. \"DeSantis seemed above the fray,\" DeSantis donor Dan Eberhart said. \"He was calm, measured and presidential. He showed he's the only alternative to Donald Trump.\" McDaniel, whom Ramaswamy called on to resign as head of the RNC from the debate stage, said she wasn't bothered by the lack of discussion of Trump \u2014 who first installed her at the RNC. \"I\u2019m fine with that. I would rather talk about Joe Biden. I want to talk about the policies that Americans care about,\u201d McDaniel told NBC News. \u201cObviously, this was a change from where we were even a month ago with what happened in Israel. And when NBC and I discussed this, we really felt like this is a time for us to meet the moment and make this a more policy-driven debate, and I think they\u2019ve delivered.\u201d Republican strategists who spoke to NBC News after the debate said DeSantis and Haley were in a class by themselves \u2014 but that it won't matter, because Trump wasn't there and he suffered no serious damage for his absence. \"Haley and DeSantis clearly stand out on that stage,\" said a veteran GOP strategist who isn't aligned with any campaign. \"Nothing tonight matters by the time [of the] Panthers-Bears kickoff in a barnburner 'Thursday Night Football' game in 22 hours.\" Jonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Washington.

        "title": "Fact-checking the third Republican primary debate",
        "content": "Five Republican presidential candidates traded rhetorical blows in Miami on Wednesday night, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina discussed fracking and fentanyl to the economy and Donald Trump. Some of the claims they made over two hours onstage were false or exaggerated, while others required critical context and yet more adhered more closely to the truth. NBC News fact-checked the candidates in real time. For full coverage, visit the debate live blog. Here are some of the top issues the candidates brought up. Ramaswamy said he would focus on both the southern and northern borders to combat the fentanyl crisis in America. \u201cThere was enough fentanyl that was captured just on the northern border last year to kill 3 million Americans. So we got to just skate to where the puck is going, not just where the puck is,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t just build the wall; build both walls.\u201d This is largely false. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported 14 pounds of fentanyl were seized on the Canadian border last year, out of 14,700 pounds seized throughout the U.S. The 3 million deaths number is most likely based on the DEA\u2019s estimate that 1 kilogram of fentanyl could kill up to 500,000 people. So while it\u2019s true that the amount of fentanyl seized from Canada technically could kill up to 3 million people, the focus on Canada seems unwarranted given that it represents one-thousandth of all seizures. It is worth noting that, with his skating metaphor, he was referring to the great Canadian hockey star Wayne Gretzky\u2019s best-known quote.  \u201cIt cracks me up that Ron continues to do this. He has opposed fracking. He\u2019s opposed drilling,\u201d Haley said. \u201cHe was praised by the Sierra Club, and you\u2019re trying to make up for it and act like you weren\u2019t a liberal when it comes to the environment.\u201d This is mostly true. DeSantis\u2019s record as governor of Florida is more progressive on the environment than the records of other candidates running for office. He has embraced protecting the Everglades and opposed hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and drilling in the state. In 2019, the Sierra Club they said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with one of his budgets. In more recent years, however, it has condemned his administration. Scott said gas prices are \u201c40% higher right now than they were just a little over two years ago.\u201d This is false. A gallon of regular gas costs about $3.40 per gallon on average this week, compared with $3.41 per gallon in November 2021, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Prices did spike over the course of 2022 (to as high as $5 per gallon in June 2022), in part because of the war in Ukraine, but they have since come down. Scott said he would ban abortions from occurring \u201cup until the day of birth\u201d and \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t allow\u201d the \u201cinfanticide\u201d he said a Democratic governor had talked about. This is misleading. The vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester. In 2020, just 0.9% of abortions occurred after 21 weeks of gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abortions after the point of viability are often due to severe congenital abnormalities or maternal complications. Ninety-three percent of abortions in 2020 occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. Infanticide is already illegal. Then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made controversial remarks about giving families choices on resuscitating dying infants. Trump made a similar false claim during his 2019 State of the Union address, and NBC News debunked it then. \u201cMy message to [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is this: You are done buying land in this country,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cChina is buying our farmland,\u201d Scott said. This is largely false. While state and federal lawmakers have been pushing to restrict Chinese purchases of land in the U.S., a recent NBC News data analysis of real estate purchases filed with the U.S. Agriculture Department showed China purchased fewer than 1,400 acres in the past year and a half, out of 1.3 billion acres of agricultural land. A third of foreign-owned acres of U.S. land are held by Canadian interests, while Chinese interests hold just three-hundredths of 1%. \u201cPrices are going up,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cBut wages have remained flat.\u201d  This is half-true. Americans made average hourly earnings of $34 per hour in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s up 4.1% from $32.66 the year before and up 19% from $28.55 in February 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic swept the U.S. BLS data shows that consumer prices overall are, indeed, rising, though at a sharply slower pace than a year ago. They are up 3.7% over the last year and up 19% since February 2020. But many price categories have fallen from earlier peaks. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk rose from $3.19 in November 2019 to $4.20 in May 2022 but settled back at $3.97 this fall. \u201cI believe that we have sleeper terrorist cells in America. Thousands of people have come from Yemen, Iran, Syria and Iraq,\u201d Scott said. This is not supported by evidence. While Scott said he \u201cbelieves\u201d there are sleeper cells, he did not cite any evidence, and there is scant proof of any such sleeper cells. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda have called for the establishment of sleeper cells, but such cells have largely been debunked. After a U.S. airstrike killed Iran\u2019s military leader Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, there were fears that Hezbollah sleeper cells might be activated, but there is no evidence of any such activity. Criticizing American support for Ukraine\u2019s war on Russia, Ramaswamy said U.S. dollars are funding \u201cthe banning of Christians,\u201d mentioning the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This is misleading. Ukraine has taken steps to ban pro-Russia groups for months, taking steps to ban the activities of religious and political groups with ties to Russia. Last month the Ukrainian parliament took steps to ban the operations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has had close ties to Moscow. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church split with the Russian Orthodox Church in May 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine. \u201cBiden\u2019s neglect has been atrocious,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cHe left them stranded; they couldn\u2019t get flights out. So I scrambled resources in Florida. I sent planes over to Israel, and I brought back over 700 people to safety.\u201d This is half-true. The Biden administration initially told Americans in Israel to take advantage of commercial flights on Oct. 9, but flights from Israel to the U.S. were scarce, and prices were reportedly as high as $25,000. Some Americans in Israel at the time posted on social media that they were stranded. On Oct. 12, DeSantis signed an executive order that allowed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to pay for Americans in Israel to fly back to the U.S. The flights, however, were organized by the Tampa-based nonprofit group Project Dynamo, which specializes in rescuing Americans in distress, and DeSantis\u2019 primary role was to fund the flights. On the same day, the U.S. announced it would help Americans evacuate on charter flights. About 1,500 Americans did leave Israel with help from the U.S. government. U.S. citizens were responsible for paying for the government flights, while DeSantis footed the bill for his flights. Jane C. Timm is a senior reporter for NBC News. Peter W.

        "title": "A day after election losses, GOP candidates gloss over struggles on abortion policy at the debate",
        "content": "Republicans and abortion-rights opponents lost elections across the country Tuesday, in large part because the party still hasn\u2019t found a successful message or policy on abortion rights. And when the issue emerged at the GOP primary debate Wednesday night, the five candidates onstage couldn\u2019t agree on how the party should best handle the complicated issue. The fragmented responses further underscored the challenges Republicans face on the issue heading into 2024. Asked to outline the GOP\u2019s \u201cpath forward\u201d on abortion rights, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina re-litigated the ongoing squabbles over the issue within the party. And none broke any new ground in finding a compelling answer to the political problem that has confounded Republicans for the 17 months since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. DeSantis said that \u201cwe\u2019re better off when we can promote a culture of life\u201d but acknowledged that each state does it \"a little bit different.\" He said Republicans and abortion opponents must \u201cdo a better job on\u201d ballot measures and referendums related to abortion rights \u2014 but he didn\u2019t explain how. Haley touted herself as \u201cunapologetically pro-life\u201d and lauded states for taking matters into their own hands following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year striking down federal protection for abortion rights. But when it came to pitching a new federal proposal, she said it wouldn\u2019t ever be politically possible to enact any nationwide abortion restrictions. \u201cBe honest, it\u2019s going to take 60 votes \u2026 and a president to sign it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo Republican president can ban abortions,\u201d she continued, before she added, \u201cLet\u2019s find consensus.\u201d Scott then expanded on what other Republicans have previously said the consensus position should be: a 15-week abortion ban. \u201cI would certainly as president of the United States have a 15-week national limit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a 15-week federal limit.\u201d Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy emphasized the need for \u201csexual responsibility for men,\u201d while former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he was \u201cpro-life not just in the womb\u201d but \u201cfor the whole life.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel appeared on NBC's \"TODAY\" show and said Republican candidates \u201chave to talk about\u201d the issue. Republican candidates suffered losses Tuesday night in the Virginia legislative elections and the Kentucky governor\u2019s race \u2014 campaigns in which Democrats put abortion rights front and center \u2014 while a ballot measure in Ohio to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution also passed. The results were the latest in an unbroken winning streak by candidates and ballot measures supporting abortion rights since the high court\u2019s June 2022 Dobbs ruling, and they further highlighted Republican struggles on the issue.  The outcome in Virginia \u2014 where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin had made a proposed 15-week abortion a focus of his efforts to help the GOP gain control of the state government \u2014 was of particular concern to Republicans, who widely viewed the proposal (which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the woman) as a test message for Republicans looking for a moderate reproductive rights policy and message to run on in the post-Roe landscape. Its failure among Virginia voters was the strongest piece of evidence yet that, heading into 2024, Republicans still lack an effective way to counter messaging from Democrats who have successfully attacked them over their support of more restrictive abortion laws. Earlier during the debate Wednesday night, which was hosted by NBC News, several candidates indicated they were deeply angered by their party\u2019s continued losses. \u201cWhat we saw last night, I\u2019m sick of Republicans losing,\u201d DeSantis said, while Ramaswamy called the GOP a \u201cparty of losers\u201d that got \u201ctrounced last night.\u201d Neither of them, however, mentioned the party\u2019s struggles with abortion as a factor in the losses.

        "content": "MIAMI \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy warned he\u2019d be unconstrained at Wednesday night's debate, and unconstrained he was \u2014 leading to an intense moment when former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called him \u201cjust scum.\u201d  Just minutes after first taking the stage, Ramaswamy went after three women: Haley, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and NBC News' Kristen Welker, who was one of the debate moderators. Read live debate updates here. \u201cWe got trounced last night in 2023. And I think that we have to have accountability in our party,\u201d Ramaswamy said of the previous night's elections in Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky, where Republicans suffered losses. \u201cFor that matter, Ronna, if you want to come onstage tonight, you want to look the GOP voters in the eye and tell them you resign, I will turn over my \u2014 yield my time to you.\" But Ramaswamy kept up his focus on Haley, with the most intense moment coming when he went after her daughter. He said she had joined TikTok, even as Haley had criticized Ramaswamy at a previous debate for using the app despite its ties to China.  \u201cShe made fun of me for actually joining TikTok while her own daughter was actually using the app for a long time,\u201d he said.  \u201cLeave my daughter out of your voice,\u201d Haley sneered. \u201cJust scum,\u201d she added. The attack came after Haley's dig at Ramaswamy at the second debate went viral. \"Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say,\" Haley told him then. After Wednesday night's debate, Haley said, \"Look, I'm a mom. I'm a mom. So the second that you go and you start saying something about my 25-year-old daughter, I'm going to get my back up. But it's not even the personal part - there are serious differences I have with him.\" Ramaswamy also kept the war of words going post-debate. \u201cIf you look at the last several debates, you can ask her the same question,\u201d Ramaswamy told reporters when asked about making personal attacks. \u201cI think the last debate, she might have said that something like you feel she feels dumber every time she hears me speak? Well, I think ... she\u2019s been exposed.\u201d Ramaswamy also went after Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis together on foreign policy during the debate, implying that Haley would drive the U.S. toward \"the mistakes from the neocon establishment of the past.\" He asked the audience: \"Do you want a leader from a different generation who's gonna put this country first? Or do you want Dick Cheney in three-inch heels?\" Ramaswamy then added: \"In which case, we've got two of them on stage tonight.\" Haley fired back soon after. \"I'd first like to say, they're five-inch heels.\" And she added, \"They're not for a fashion statement. They're for ammunition.\" Ramaswamy also attacked Welker during the debate, referencing the 2016 election and \"the corrupt media establishment\" and then accusing her of taking part in a \"Trump Russia collusion hoax that you pushed on this network for years. Was that real or was that Hillary Clinton made-up disinformation? Answer the question. Go.\" \u201cHe is a supporter of women,\u201d his wife, Apoorva, told NBC News after the debate. \u201cI am a surgeon. I\u2019m working I went to Yale for college and medical school and he has supported me in every stage of my career. He is extremely pro woman.\u201d NBC News asked Ronna McDaniel after the debate for response to Ramaswamy, and she said she wanted to keep the focus on Joe Biden. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to focus on attacking other Republicans. I do think it\u2019s a symptom of some of the things that we saw in '22 with Republicans attacking other Republicans. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a winning strategy. So I\u2019m going to focus on the border, fentanyl, crime \u2014 the issues that the voters want to hear about. And they really want to hear us take on the Democrats.\u201d Haley has been rising in the polls, challenging DeSantis for the second-place spot that he had comfortably held for months. During the debate Wednesday night, Haley was one of the top candidates who faced attacks from her rivals \u2014 and threw out attacks \u2014 according to NBC News' tracker.

According to the lawsuit, Byrne published false statements in June claiming that the president's son reached out to the Iranian government in 2021, offering to have his father \u201cunfreeze\u201d $8 billion in Iranian funds for a bribe. \u201cThese defamatory statements by Byrne are not merely false and not merely malicious\u2014they are completely outrageous,\u201d Biden\u2019s attorneys wrote in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in California. Byrne, a staunch Trump ally, reposted the \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d statements alleging Biden had corrupt and treasonous dealings with Iran on X on Oct. 8, the lawsuit says, a day after Hamas attacks in Israel killed about 1,400 people. Biden\u2019s attorneys said the post implied his \u201callegedly criminal and corrupt actions had contributed to the terrorist attacks by Hamas.\u201d \u201cByrne knows his statements are baseless and yet published and republished them anyway, and he continues to propagate his lies to anyone who will listen, including his hundreds of thousands of social media followers,\u201d they added. Biden\u2019s attorneys also said that they sent a formal demand for retraction to Byrne on Oct. 26 but that he has \u201cignored\u201d the demand and \u201chas taken no steps to disavow his false claims.\u201d An attorney for Byrne was not listed in Wednesday's court filing. A lawyer representing Byrne in separate pending lawsuits did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night. Biden filed the lawsuit the same day House Republicans subpoenaed him and the president\u2019s brother James Biden. Byrne, who has also been sued for defamation by Dominion Voting Systems, promoted former President Donald Trump's false election claims in the aftermath of the 2020 contest. He was also present at an Oval Office meeting on Dec. 18, 2020, when a group of Trump allies urged the then-president to invoke a national emergency to stay in office, former White House counsel Pat Cipollone testified last year. Wednesday's lawsuit is the latest in a string of suits Biden has filed in recent months as House Republicans step up probes of the president and his family in an impeachment inquiry. In a pair of lawsuits in September, Biden alleged that two IRS agents were unlawfully sharing his tax information, and he alleged data access violations and computer fraud by Rudy Giuliani, his businesses and his former lawyer Robert Costello.

        "title": "Highlights from the third Republican Debate: Ramaswamy, Haley and DeSantis spar over Trump, abortion and the economy",
        "content": "Jane C. Timm \u201cIt cracks me up that Ron continues to do this. He has opposed fracking. He\u2019s opposed drilling,\u201d Haley said today. \u201cHe was praised by the Sierra Club, and you\u2019re trying to make up for it and act like you weren\u2019t a liberal when it comes to the environment.\u201d This is mostly true. DeSantis's record as governor is more progressive than the records of the other candidates running for office. He has embraced protecting the Everglades and opposed fracking and drilling in Florida. In 2019, the Sierra Club they said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with one of his budgets. In more recent years, however, it has condemned his administration. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott said his girlfriend was at the debate, saying they\u2019ve been dating for several months and that she was at his campaign launch event. NBC News: \"Any special guests with you today?\" Scott: \"All my guests are special.\" NBC News: \"You were seen on the stage after the debate taking a photo. Any insight on who that was?\" Scott: \"Oh, my girlfriend.\" His campaign said her first name is Mindy. Megan Lebowitz Biden\u2019s campaign manager laid into the GOP candidates in a statement after the debate ended, tying the Republican candidates to Trump. \"Normally, after you lose, you take a moment to reflect and course correct,\" Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \"But in Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA Republican Party, apparently you double down on the same extreme agenda that was soundly rejected last night in elections across the country.\" She said that in 2024, voters will choose between Biden and \u201cMAGA Republicans, whose policy platform is to make things worse for you by taking away your freedoms.\u201d Vaughn Hillyard Trump will not attend the fourth debate in December in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita said. LaCivita added the caveat that he has used for previous debates: \u201cUntil he is.\u201d Katherine Koretski Notably, the RNC is not holding the Ramaswamy sign in the spin room. It\u2019s his body man, Patrick. Ramaswamy went after the RNC and its chairwoman hard tonight. Sahil Kapur DeSantis, on NBC News Now, says his view of the GOP primary electorate is: 25% are all in for Trump, 25% have moved on and want an alternative, and 50% are open. He indicated his focus is on the 50%. Sahil Kapur On his home turf at the Republican presidential debate in Miami, DeSantis sharpened his case against Trump and tussled with Haley as she looked to build on her momentum. Five candidates met on stage Wednesday night, just over two months before voting begins: DeSantis, Haley, Scott, Ramaswamy and Christie. Absent for the third time was Trump, the former president who is dominating the GOP polls so far \u2014 and continued his debate counterprogramming tradition with a rally in nearby Hialeah. While DeSantis and Haley are competing for second place and a shot at being the main GOP alternative to Trump, the other three are fighting to keep their candidacies alive. Here are some key takeaways from the debate. Brian Cheung \u201cPrices are going up,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cBut wages have remained flat.\u201d  This is half true. Americans made average hourly earnings of $34 per hour in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s up 4.1% from $32.66 the year prior and up 19% from $28.55 in February 2020, just before the pandemic swept the U.S. BLS data shows that consumer prices overall are indeed rising, though at a sharply slower pace than a year ago. They are up 3.7% over the last year, and up 19% since February 2020. But many price categories have fallen from earlier peaks. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk rose from $3.19 in November 2019 to $4.20 in May 2022, but settled back at $3.97 this fall. Peter W. Klein Ramaswamy said tonight that he would focus on both the southern and northern border in effort to combat the fentanyl crisis in America. \u201cThere was enough fentanyl that was captured just on the northern border last year to kill 3 million Americans. So we got to just skate to where the puck is going, not just where the puck is. Don\u2019t just build the wall, build both walls.\u201d This is largely false. The DEA reported 14 pounds of fentanyl seized on the Canadian border in 2022, out of 14,700 pounds seized throughout the U.S. The 3 million number is likely based on the DEA\u2019s estimate that one kilogram of fentanyl could kill up to 500,000 people. So while it\u2019s true that the amount of fentanyl seized from Canada could technically kill up to 3 million, the focus on Canada seems unwarranted given that it represents one-thousandth of 1 percent of seizures. It is worth noting that, with his skating metaphor, he was referring to the great Canadian hockey star Wayne Gretzky\u2019s best-known quote.  Watch: The candidates delivered closing remarks. Katie Primm Haley got the most questions. Scott spoke the longest. Here's how it all broke down. Question Count (Note this includes follow-ups if the candidate didn\u2019t answer the initial question) Total Speaking Time (Note this includes questions, follow-ups, opening & closing statements and interruptions.) Jason Abbruzzese Ramaswamy's on-stage combativeness appears to have paid off, as he\u2019s the top trending topic on X in the U.S. at the moment. Note: Another trending hashtag, #TellUsNicki, refers to Nicki Minaj, not Nikki Haley. Sarah Mimms After the debate ended, Ramaswamy walked right past Haley to shake Christie\u2019s hand \u2014 and Ramaswamy appeared to greet all of his opponents but her before walking off. Haley didn't make eye contact with him either as both spoke to their opponents and then greeted family members. Nigel Chiwaya, Joe Murphy and Chet Hill Ramaswamy was not the target he was in the first two debates. See the debate attack tracker. Jane C. Timm Scott said he would ban abortions from occurring \u201cup until the day of birth\u201d and \"certainly wouldn't allow\" the infanticide he said a Democratic governor had talked about. Scott's claims are misleading. The vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester. In 2020, just 0.9 percent of abortions occurred after 21 weeks of gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abortions after the point of viability are often due to severe congenital abnormalities or maternal complications. Ninety-three percent of abortions in 2020 occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. Infanticide is already illegal. Then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made controversial remarks about giving families choices on resuscitating dying infants. Trump made a similar false claim during his 2019 State of the Union, and NBC News debunked it then. Dasha Burns Ramaswamy also brought up a theory that\u2019s been circulating through the GOP that Biden will not ultimately be the Democratic nominee. This unfounded theory has been big with Republicans lately. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Big applause at the Iowa watch party for Ramaswamy saying Biden isn\u2019t really president, echoing conspiracy theories. Maura Barrett And one final glance from Haley to Christie during Ramaswamy\u2019s closing remarks. That marks at least three from my watch in the debate hall. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Kyle Claire, 20, is a college Young Republican from the University of Iowa. Claire is a DeSantis fan who was jazzed about Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019 recent endorsement of the Florida governor. He\u2019s still considering Haley though, and feels like DeSantis waffled on his stance on Ukraine on the debate stage tonight. \u201cI think DeSantis needs to take a little bit stronger stance on Ukraine,\u201d said Claire, a junior studying political science. \"There\u2019s nothing more 'America First' than ensuring our security, and that includes ensuring the security of our allies, too.\" From Texas: Abortions in Texas have dropped significantly since Roe vs. Wade was overturned last year. The state already had one of the strictest laws and now abortions hardly ever happen. According to this 2023 report from the Society of Family Planning, roughly 2,650 abortions were performed per month from April to June 2022 in the state. Then came Dobbs in June 2022. From then until December 2022, 10 abortions were performed per month.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Maura Barrett During the last commercial break, spouses & family of the candidates warmly greet one another and catch up as they gather to go to the spin room, a stark contrast to the awkward group photo the candidates seemingly didn\u2019t want to engage in when they came on stage at the top of the program. Jillian Frankel To clarify, Ramaswamy said that Issue 1 in Ohio will codify the right to an abortion all the way up to the time of birth, but actually the new amendment to the state constitution will prohibit abortion after fetal viability except when the mother\u2019s life or health is at risk. Adam Edelman The candidates are all arguing over a national 15-week abortion ban. But just last night voters in Virginia rejected the same proposal in awarding control of the state\u2019s two legislative chambers to Democrats. Gov. Glenn Youngkin put the proposal \u2014 which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother \u2014 at the center of his effort to help Republicans gain control of state government. Strategists had viewed the proposal as a test message for Republicans looking for a moderate reproductive rights policy and message to run on. And it failed. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jonathan Liptak, from Keene, New Hampshire said, \u201cRon had a great abortion answer. Pro-life is a losing argument, as seen in the last 2 elections. Most abortions happen under 12 weeks, and most people would support a 16-week ban. Absolutely not until labor. That should be the message to GOP and voters.\u201d Bianca Seward Jennifer Baier in Dallas County, Iowa, said she favored Haley\u2019s abortion position best of the candidates and was frustrated by the hard stance of the others. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re trying to legislate morality, and that\u2019s never been the business of the government,\u201d she said. Abigail Brooks Scott\u2019s answer here highlights the gray area where a lot of Americans live on abortion: They oppose total bans, but the further along a pregnancy is, the fewer Americans support abortion, per Pew. Lauren Mayk Abortion played a role in the heated and expensive race for an open seat on Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court between Democrat Dan McCaffery and Republican Carolyn Carluccio. Democrat McCaffery won yesterday 53-47. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has used his support for a 15-week federal abortion limit to differentiate himself from, and call out, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. At the last debate, he asked DeSantis on the stage if he\u2019d sign a federal ban as president. Phil Prazan It is illegal to perform an abortion in Texas, including mailing an abortion-inducing pill like mifepristone in most cases. There is a very narrow exception \u2014 only to save the life of the mother or to stop a \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d There\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit over the latest law because abortion providers and women seeking abortions are confused about what is allowed under that very narrow exception.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Gabe Conley, 30, came to the watch party unsure if he was going to caucus for Ramaswamy or DeSantis. After tonight\u2019s performance, he\u2019s leaning toward Ramaswamy. \u201cEveryone else on that stage is a neoconservative, traditional status quo moderate,\u201d said Conley. Conley says he likes Ramaswamy\u2019s fighting spirit. \u201cHe\u2019s coming out with that same energy that Trump had in those debates, and any student of history knows that that went pretty well for Trump,\u201d said Conley, a resident physician from Cherokee, Iowa. Chet Hill, Nigel Chiwaya and Joe Murphy Biden's leading all the off-stage targets in attacks a little more than 90 minutes into the debate. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker. Natasha Korecki and Dasha Burns Natasha Korecki says: Haley stands out in this crowd for taking a more moderate approach on abortion, asking to find consensus on the issue. She said tonight what she\u2019s said in the past: There will be no federal ban because there aren\u2019t 60 votes for one. Adds Dasha Burns: Haley is perhaps the most moderate candidate on the stage when it comes to abortion rights. Listening to her language might be an indication of how Republicans start to change their messaging after seeing losses like last night. From Texas: Texas Republican voters want fewer people coming into the country period. Even when it comes to legal immigration, according to the Texas Politics Project, in 2022, 61% of Republican voters believe there are \u201ctoo many\u201d people coming to Texas legally. A candidate cannot talk tough enough on immigration and border security to make inroads with Texas GOP primary voters. Even in the state government, 61% of Republican voters in August 2023 said the state was spending too little on border security. For context: Texas leaders have spent roughly $12 billion on border security and Gov. Abbott\u2019s Operation Lone Star in the last few years. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Brian Cheung Sen. Tim Scott said gas prices are \u201c40% higher right now than they were just a little over two years ago,\u201d but government data shows prices are about the same now as they were in November 2021. This is false. A gallon of regular gas costs about $3.40 per gallon on average this week, compared with $3.41 per gallon in November 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Prices did spike over the course of 2022 (to as high as $5 per gallon in June 2022), due in part to the war in Ukraine, but have since come down. Garrett Haake Haley\u2019s most sustained applause in the room of the evening came on that abortion answer. Lauren Mayk Philadelphia recorded more than 1,400 deaths to overdoses in 2022, an 11% jump from 2021, per the city\u2019s health department. The Kensington section of the city has become known for its visible drug use and open-air drug market \u2014 and political candidates including Mehmet Oz and Vivek Ramaswamy have documented trips there.   Recently, Mayor-elect Cherelle Parker said the National Guard could be part of a \u201ccomprehensive approach\u201d to address crime and drug issues there. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Abigail Brooks Pro-abortion rights advocates are trying to get a ballot initiative going in Florida in 2024, much like the one that passed in Ohio last night. Dasha Burns DeSantis often implies that abortion rights issues should remain with the states, but he has not been clear about what he would or would not do at the federal level. Dasha Burns The first question on abortion goes to DeSantis \u2014 who signed a 6-week abortion ban here in Florida. Allan Smith Ramaswamy calling for a border wall along the U.S. border with Canada. Didn\u2019t have that one on the bingo card. Phil Prazan Immigration and border security are the TOP issues for Texas GOP primary voters. The state has the most contiguous miles along the Mexican border; state lawmakers know this and act accordingly. Yesterday, state lawmakers were called back to a fourth special session by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott. Republican lawmakers aim to pass a law allowing local and state police in Texas to arrest people they believe crossed into the state illegally. There was a policy difference between that item in the third special session but with the latest news from today, that detail seems to be worked out. Expect that law to pass and be immediately challenged by immigrant rights groups. It was filed in the third special session as HB 4 by Rep. David Spiller, R \u2014 Jacksboro. It led to a heated, all-night session a few weeks ago. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, says she doesn\u2019t care what her friends at the U.N. would say if she sends in special operations into Mexico to target cartels. She has long said she would take a two-pronged approach to fentanyl, special operations in Mexico and suspending trade relations with China until they stop flooding the U.S. with it. Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns DeSantis\u2019 \u201cstone cold dead\u201d line usually gets big applause on the trail in Iowa. Abigail Brooks Fentanyl deaths are a big part of DeSantis\u2019 stump speech, but the anecdotes he tells are usually like the one he just told: focused on people who accidentally take drugs laced with fentanyl, and not focused on addiction. Alana Satlin Big applause for Christie after his answer on fentanyl, noting that he thinks addiction should be treated like a disease. Lauren Mayk Florida has about 542,000 residents receiving Social Security (about 229,000 age 65 and over). Pennsylvania has about 325,000 (82,000 age 65 and over), per federal data. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Jason Abbruzzese Google Trends offers a sense of who is generating interest during the debate, and so far it's Haley and Ramawamy, followed by DeSantis, Christie and Scott. DeSantis had the single biggest spike, while Haley has had at least six distinct bumps. Allan Smith To sum up this debate so far: A bunch of candidates who significantly trail Trump \u2014 and are running out of time to make up the deficit \u2014 are offering shortened versions of their campaign stump speech, attacking each other and, aside from the first question, almost entirely ignoring the man they have to beat to win. One way to measure how little Trump has come up in tonight\u2019s debate: The fact Christie has yet to get booed during an answer. Olympia Sonnier TeamTrump hitting Ron DeSantis on Medicare and Social Security, as they have throughout the campaign, even before DeSantis announced. This and disloyalty to Trump have been their main points of attack throughout the campaign, as they try to draw older Florida voters to their camp. Phil Prazan More on energy in Texas: While many see the state as just an oil and gas state, it\u2019s way more interesting and complex. Because of then-Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s policies from years ago, solar and wind power are pretty common in the state. Just look at today, according to the largest Texas power grid \u2014 ERCOT, 29.4 percent of the power generated in Texas today was from wind power. Natural gas is still the leader with 47.7%. Coal comes in at 15.4% and nuclear comes in at 7.4%. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Abigail Brooks and Alec Hern\u00e1ndez DeSantis actually got some laughs in the debate hall with that Social Security joke, a subtle nod to the masses of retirees living out their golden years in his home state. That lighter moment is straight out of DeSantis\u2019 stump speech. His joke about knowing a few Social Security recipients usually gets laughs on the campaign trail, too. Jason Abbruzzese A Laffer Curve reference! The economics wonks must be buzzing. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Rita Mattson, 67, is an undecided voter from Dublin, New Hampshire. \u201cSocial Security is NOT an entitlement,\" she said. \"Stop giving it to people who don\u2019t deserve it.\" Peter W. Klein \"I believe that we have sleeper terrorist cells in America. Thousands of people have come from Yemen, Iran, Syria and Iraq,\" Scott said Wednesday. This is not supported by evidence. While Scott said he \u201cbelieves\u201d there are sleeper cells, he did not cite any evidence, and there is scant proof of any such sleeper cells. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda have called for the establishment of sleeper cells, but they have largely been debunked. After a U.S. airstrike killed Iran\u2019s military leader Qassem Soleimani, there were fears that Hezbollah sleeper cells might be activated, but there is no evidence of any such activity. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Ramaswamy and Scott seemed to be laughing and fist-bumping each other through Haley\u2019s last answer. The two haven\u2019t exchanged attacks on the stage; it's a surprising show of camaraderie between the two. From Texas: When the candidates talk about energy, Texans listen intently \u2014 especially in the largest Texas county of Harris County. Harris County and the surrounding area are home to all three of the \u201cbig three\u201d leaders in state government: Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Speaker Dade Phelan. Sen. Ted Cruz is also from Harris County. Southeast Texas is the energy sector of the state, where the Houston ship channel is the main port in and out. According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association, there may be 1.4 million jobs in the energy sector. While the jobs used to be concentrated solely in the oil industry \u2014 with special attention to the Permian basin around Midland and Odessa. However, now, Texas is also a natural gas state. Many gas companies are based in Houston, so the nods to fracking will be noticed in Southeast Texas. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Victoria Gulla, 50, from Spofford, New Hampshire, said, Ramaswamy \"is the most annoying. Again.\u201d Gulla\u2019s thoughts on the debate so far: \u201cSo far I think there is a clear dichotomy between the policies of the past and the now. Haley, Scott and Christie are living in the past with their wars everywhere. DeSantis on the right track with more peace through strength, let Europe lead on their front, and take care of business at home (border), while supporting our allies in ways that don\u2019t involve our troops.\u201d She is supporting DeSantis. Peter W. Klein \u201cMy message to [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is this, you are done buying land in this country,\" said Ramaswamy. \u201cChina is buying our farmland,\u201d Scott said. This is largely false. While state and federal lawmakers have been pushing to restrict Chinese purchases of land in America, a recent NBC News data analysis of real estate purchases filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed fewer than 1,400 acres were purchased by China in the past year and a half, out of 1.3 billion acres of agricultural land. A third of foreign-owned acres of U.S. land are held by Canadian interests, while Chinese interests hold just three-hundredths of 1%. Jason Abbruzzese Warren Buffett is somehow catching strays. Chuck Todd and Garrett Haake Chuck Todd says: If it wasn\u2019t for the first specific question asking about Trump, I\u2019m struggling to think of too many other times where any of them have gone after Trump\u2026 only each other. Garrett Haake responds: I\u2019m reminded of our polling from over the summer that attacking Trump is the least popular action a candidate can take. They begrudgingly did it early and are clearly hoping they won\u2019t have to again Bianca Seward The DeSantis war room X account has focused all of their posts during tonight\u2019s debate on Nikki Haley attacks and no other candidates. Haley just caught up to DeSantis in Iowa according to our NBC/Des Moines Register poll. Jason Abbruzzese Worth noting on the energy debate: The U.S. recently hit an all-time high in oil production. Jane C. Timm Criticizing American support for Ukraine\u2019s war on Russia, Ramaswamy said U.S. dollars are funding \u201cthe banning of Christians,\u201d mentioning the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This is misleading. Ukraine has taken steps to ban pro-Russia groups for months, taking steps to ban the activities of religious and political groups with ties to Russia. Last month the Ukrainian parliament took steps to ban the operations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has close ties to Moscow. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church split with the Russian Orthodox Church in May 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Olympia Sonnier TeamTrump's X account has been putting out Trump policy videos or opposition research on DeSantis that are following the topics of the debate: China, TikTok, antisemitism in colleges and trade. From Texas: Despite some recent good economic numbers, many Texans don\u2019t feel like the economy is doing well. What\u2019s interesting in trends from UT\u2019s Texas Politics Project \u2014 Republican voters in Texas view the economy through a partisan lens. In Feb. 2020, when Trump was in office, 84% of GOP Texas voters thought the economy was better than the year before. That number plummeted to 14% by Feb. 2021, when Biden was in office. The numbers began to go down steeply during the Covid pandemic but then never recovered. Meanwhile, the number of Texas Republicans who believe the economy is worse than a year before is now at 75% despite the recent good numbers. A lot of this may be their media diet but the result is clear: Texas Republicans believe the economy is in the tank Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Ginger Gibson You can feel the difference of having less candidates on the stage this time. The punchiness of Ramaswamy and Haley has less lost moments with the struggling candidates interjecting. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Angela Boelens came to the debate watch party with two Ukrainian refugees, Liana Avetisian and Alina Mirzoian, whom she helped resettle into their new lives in Dewitt, Iowa. Boelens and the refugees were visibly disgusted by how Vivek Ramaswamy characterized the Ukrainian government. \u201cIt scares me knowing that there\u2019s a lot of Americans out there who don\u2019t know the facts and don\u2019t know how to fact-check the man,\u201d said Boelens of Ramaswamy\u2019s depiction of Ukraine as a corrupt nation. Boelens, who is supporting Nikki Haley in the upcoming Iowa caucuses, said she was impressed by the way her favorite candidate talked about Ukraine. \u201cI think that the smart, savvy candidates like Nikki Haley, and even Chris Christie, I think they understand the connection between how we\u2019re perceived around the world in terms of backing up and supporting these democracies.\u201d Jackie Nespral On the question of Trump's and Biden's different policy approaches to the Maduro regime: DeSantis said that he would reinstate the Trump sanctions and not rely on Venezuelan oil. This is something that resonates with the South Florida community because there is a large Venezuelan community here. South Florida has the largest Venezuelan community in the country. Jackie Nespral is the main anchor for NBC6 in Miami and the host of Impact, a politics and current events show. Abigail Brooks A GOP operative texts me: \u201cIf Nikki goes over and punches Vivek in the face, her poll numbers would shoot up.\u201d Joe Murphy, Chet Hill and Nigel Chiwaya A little more than an hour in and Christie and Scott have yet to be attacked. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Tim Scott\u2019s mother, Frances, who he referred to in this answer, is in the audience. She\u2019s attended all three debates. Olympia Sonnier Someone in Trump-world is watching the debate. Trump adviser Jason Miller tweets out Trump video \u201cAvoiding World War III\u201d with the caption: \"The JV gang took the bait and is missing the point here. Only President Trump knows this about AVOIDING World War III, not pushing us headfirst into it!\u201d Phil Prazan From Texas: Haley and Ramaswamy going back and forth here is a fight over a relatively small amount of Texans. Both candidates don\u2019t have a major presence in Texas. Last week, University of Houston and Texas Southern University: 58% of Texas 2024 GOP primary voters still intend to vote for Trump. Number two is DeSantis with 14% \u2014 according to Axios Houston. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Kristen Reynolds, 61, from Swanzey, New Hampshire, started the night thinking Ramaswamy was \u201cfunny and on point.\u201d Now, she says: \u201cVivek needs to stop attacking Nikki.\u201d David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, there are some plausible paths forward, including congressional action, executive action and a push to sell the app. Read more here. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has long rejected the notion of banning TikTok, citing past attempts by the Trump administration that were shot down by the courts. He\u2019s instead proposed requiring \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling on all apps and boosting parental controls. Abigail Brooks, Garrett Haake, Allan Smith and Olympia Sonnier Loud boos and mutters of \u201cOh, Jesus\u201d from within the debate hall as Ramaswamy takes a swipe at Nikki Haley\u2019s daughter for using TikTok. He\u2019s played the heel well up until now, with the room at best divided over his more controversial comments. He lost the room there. Haley shoots back, calling him \"scum\" and warning him not to go after her daughter (who is an adult and currently in the audience.) Phil Prazan In Texas, the kids like TikTok a lot more than their parents or grandparents, according to April polling on the issue. The poll found 43% of Texans get their news from local television stations, according to UT-Austin\u2019s Texas Politics Project. And 42% of Texans get their news from social media including TikTok; 52% of GOP voters 30 years old or younger have a positive view of TikTok. According to a poll from February, 64% of Texans 18-29 used TikTok in the last month. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Jake Traylor On stage in Hileah, Florida, Trump seemingly talking about Ramaswamy: \u201cA lot of people say that. Why are you running? He said I\u2019m a younger version. It\u2019s OK to say but we want the older version, right?\u201d David Ingram and Kat Tenbarge Critics have alleged that TikTok is using its influence to push content that is pro-Palestinian and contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. The claims about TikTok\u2019s promotion of pro-Palestinian content are anecdotal, and they have been bubbling up on the social media platform X, in statements to the media and on conservative media outlets such as Fox News.  TikTok said the allegations of bias are baseless.  Ultimately the perceived performance of pro-Palestinian content on the platform depends on how you parse TikTok\u2019s data. Historic trends internationally show more interest in the popular hashtag #standwithpalestine than #standwithisrael. Looking at hashtag data only from the U.S. over the last 30 days, pro-Israel content has been performing at pace, if not better, than some popular pro-Palestinian content.  Read the full story here. Olympia Sonnier In the last 10 minutes, the Trump campaign has sent out three emails highlighting his record on immigration and his \u201cplan to destroy the drug cartels.\u201d Megan Lebowitz A Biden campaign official told me campaign folks are mostly watching Trump right now. The source said they are bored with the debate and watching Trump ramble about \u201cthe same insane things that got him voted out in 2020.\u201d Maura Barrett During the commercial break, when candidates dispersed momentarily, DeSantis went to approach the edge of the stage and tripped/stumbled off the podium platform \u2014 catching himself before what honestly made me nervous could have been a face plant. He laughed it off before saying hello to his wife. David Ingram A question on TikTok comes as the popular video platform, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has re-entered the crosshairs of politicians and national security officials  TikTok has been the subject of scrutiny for years because of concerns that people in China may access the personal data of American users. Most recently, members of Congress and people in the tech industry have criticized TikTok because of pro-Palestinian content on the platform. TikTok has fended off attempts at a ban. Federal judges blocked a proposed ban by then-President Donald Trump in 2020, and TikTok has been negotiating an agreement with the Biden administration to try to allay data privacy concerns. This week, the Treasury Department declined to comment on the status of those negotiations. Chet Hill, Nigel Chiwaya and Joe Murphy At the 50-minute mark in the debate, DeSantis has made the most attacks. Jake Traylor Trump, on his own stage, said someone accused him of not having the courage to debate. \u201cWell, listen, I\u2019m standing in front of tens of thousands of people right now and it\u2019s on television. That\u2019s a hell of a lot harder to do than a debate,\" he said. Bianca Seward At the first break, Christie and Haley shared a quick smile while Ramaswamy shook DeSantis\u2019 hand and the two briefly chatted. Adam Edelman During an exchange about how the candidates would handle responding to Muslim Americans afraid for their safety in the current environment, Christie said he was one of the only persons on stage who \u201cactually had experience in dealing with this\u201d and pointed to his dealings as governor of the \u201cmost ethnically diverse state.\u201d Following 9/11, Christie said: \u201cI personally went from mosque to mosque in New Jersey and met with the leaders of those mosques and with the members of the mosques. And I said to law enforcement is on your side to protect you regardless of your religion.\u201d \u201cWe developed fabulous relationships with Muslim Americans all across the state of New Jersey,\u201d he said. It\u2019s true that Christie was applauded by the Muslim-American community during the first several years of his time in office. In particular, he was praised for slamming the New York Police Department\u2019s program that spied on Muslim communities.  But years later, in 2015, during his first presidential run, Muslim American communities widely criticized him for saying he wouldn\u2019t re-settle Syrian refugees in New Jersey or in the U.S. Chuck Todd Haley is clearly the most comfortable on these foreign policy topics than any of her competitors on stage. And if major donors are watching that are deciding between DeSantis and Haley as their preferred Trump alternative, this has likely been a very strong opening 45 minutes for Haley. This is not to say DeSantis has done poorly, he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s been much stronger tonight than at any of the previous debates. Haley simply has more experience debating these topics thanks specifically to her experience at the U.N. And on the showmanship front, the attention-seeking shenanigans of Ramaswamy that Haley has gleefully swatted away have also helped. Jake Traylor Trump just referred to the debate for the first time on stage at his rally tonight: \u201cIn the primary, we\u2019re leading the field with an average of 61% for Trump, and you have about what seven or eight candidates left. I think they\u2019re at a debate tonight. Nobody\u2019s talking about it. Everybody\u2019s watching.\" He added, \"One more quote on the debate from Trump: \u201cYou know, the last debate was the lowest-rated debate in the history of politics. So therefore, do you think we did the right thing by not participating?\u201d Garrett Haake In 2015, Hewitt\u2019s questions about the nuclear triad famously tripped up candidate Trump, who clearly had no idea what Hewitt was referring to. Here, as he asks candidates about building up the Navy, both Scott and DeSantis similarly whiff when asked about specific types of ships, size of the Navy, or when they could be built and deployed. Christie then tried to call them out for not answering. Dasha Burns and Natasha Korecki DeSantis hits Haley on giving China land when she was governor in South Carolina, she raised her hand, likely to talk about DeSantis\u2019 own entanglements with China. The two were duking it out on the issue as a prelude to the debate. His attacks echo ads that his SuperPAC has been running attacking Haley for how she handled China as governor. Katherine Koretski As Ramaswamy continuously goes after the RNC on stage and while on the trail, last month during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, NBC News asked Ramaswamy if he\u2019d ever consider running as an independent candidate for president. He answered with: \u201cI\u2019m in this to win and be our next president, and not even just to be the next president, but to reunite and re-galvanize this country. January 2033, is my destination. So the path that runs through there is winning the Republican nomination, and then winning the general election, which I expect to do.\u201d Also, Ramaswamy often says \u201cI\u2019m using the Republican Party as a vehicle because we live in a two party system.\u201d Natasha Korecki and Sarah Dean Natasha Korecki notes: Haley hits DeSantis for the first time when she called for the United States to suspend all regular trade relations with China unless it stops sending fentanyl \u2014 she says DeSantis has yet to do this. But Sarah Dean notes: Haley has gone after DeSantis less than expected based on her campaign\u2019s pre-debate memos previewing strategy. Instead, most of her attacks have been hits back at Vivek Ramaswamy going after her \u2014 leaving DeSantis largely unscathed so far. Alexandra Marquez China is another issue likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers are paying attention to. Our latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found that 50% of this group thinks that the issue of relations with China is \u201cextremely important,\u201d as they consider candidates. Dasha Burns Every debate the expectation has been DeSantis would attack or get attacked, but each time that doesn\u2019t seem to materialize. The campaign has claimed it\u2019s a good thing \u2014 he\u2019s being \u201cpresidential\u201d and \u201cabove the fray.\u201d But critics argue it makes him seem like less of a threat. Natasha Korecki and Garrett Haake Natasha Korecki observes: We\u2019re about five questions in and the most fire right now is between Ramaswamy and Haley and not Haley and DeSantis as expected. Garrett Haake responds: The coming DeSantis pile-on, now three debates in and yet to materialize Adam Edelman DeSantis appeared to pit a rise in antisemitism against a rise in Islamophobia, suggesting that one should be taken more seriously by the federal government than the other. Biden, he said, \u201cis launching an initiative to combat so-called Islamophobia.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s the antisemitism. It\u2019s spiraling out of control. That is what we have to confront,\u201d DeSantis said. The truth is that both Islamophobic incidents and antisemitic incidents have increased in the weeks since the Hamas attack on Israel. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said last week it received 774 reports of bias incidents and requests for help from Muslims across the U.S. from Oct. 7 to Oct. 24, a 182% jump from the average 16-day period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League said on Oct. 24 that there had been a \u201cnearly 400% increase in preliminary antisemitic incidents reported year-over-year.\u201d Lauren Mayk Haley says antisemitism is as bad as racism \u2014 worth noting that the Southern Poverty Law Center says antisemitism is \u201ca form of racism in itself.\u201d  Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Maura Barrett and Garrett Haake Maura Barrett observes: Another borderline eye roll & glance toward Christie from Haley when Ramaswamy claimed \u201cother people couldn\u2019t name\u201d the provinces of Ukraine that Russia has occupied Garrett Haake responds: It's not hard to imagine Christie as a Haley surrogate somewhere down the line. They\u2019re aligned on foreign policy in both style and substance. Natasha Korecki and Dasha Burns Despite his best efforts, Nikki Haley may have just had another moment by saying Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are salivating over the thought of Ramaswamy becoming president. Ramaswamy only seems to help Haley as a loose cannon foil to her seriousness. Phil Prazan According to a September poll from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, 36% of Texas voters believe the country is doing too much in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. That has gone up from 15% in 2022.  Meanwhile, 21% say the U.S. is doing too little. Thirty percent say the country is responding appropriately. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Chuck Todd Ramaswamy is like having a drunk uncle show up in the middle of a sober debate. Peter W. Klein \u201cBiden\u2019s neglect has been atrocious,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cHe left them stranded, they couldn\u2019t get flights out. So I scrambled resources in Florida. I sent planes over to Israel and I brought back over 700 people to safety.\u201d This is half true. The Biden administration initially told Americans in Israel to take advantage of commercial flights on Oct. 9, but flights from Israel to the U.S. were scarce and prices were reportedly as high as $25,000. Some Americans in Israel at the time posted on social media that they were stranded. On Oct. 12, DeSantis signed an executive order that allowed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to pay for Americans in Israel to fly back to the U.S. The flights, however, were organized by Tampa-based nonprofit Project Dynamo, which specializes in rescuing Americans in distress, and DeSantis\u2019 primary role was to fund the flights. On the same day, the U.S. announced they would help Americans evacuate on charter flights. Some 1,500 Americans did leave Israel with help from the U.S. government. U.S. citizens were responsible for paying for the government flights, while DeSantis footed the bill for his flights. Natasha Korecki and Katherine Koretski This is a common talking point for Ramaswamy when it comes to Ukraine. He often says just because Putin is bad doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine is good. But Ramaswamy saying that other candidates are coming around to his thinking on Ukraine and tiptoeing around funding for it, but this seems unlikely for Haley who has been a hawk on the situation. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has called on Biden to have a \u201csingle-minded\u201d focus on Israel and opposed his efforts to tie Israel funding to aid for Ukraine. He was a co-sponsor of the Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, which would provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel. Nigel Chiwaya, Chet Hill and Joe Murphy Thirty minutes into the third debate and most of the field is focusing their attacks on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker here. Allan Smith Just browsing social media, it seems the only line in this debate that\u2019s taken off so far is Ramaswamy blasting \u201cDick Cheney in 3-inch heels.\u201d He aimed that comment at both Haley and DeSantis. Phil Prazan With all this talk on national security and American funding for democratic allies fighting wars, Texas has a unique connection. Since 2001, many key decisions laying the groundwork for geopolitics in the Middle East were made by then-President and Texan George W. Bush \u2014 who sent American troops into a Mideast war. Expert on geopolitics, Ian Bremmer, argued the current crisis is partly a result of American power receding from the Middle East and pivoting toward Asia. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Lauren Mayk Nikki Haley is talking about college campuses as mom of a college student in Pennsylvania. She announced her son\u2019s choice of Villanova in the Philly burbs here in 2020. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley got a slightly different question on antisemitism, but she has also proposed going after universities by pulling their tax-exempt status if they allow hate speech on campus. She wants to change the official federal definition of antisemitism to include denying Israel\u2019s right to exist. Alec Hern\u00e1ndez I asked DeSantis at a campaign stop last month in South Carolina what his message would be to the family of Wadea Al-Fayoume in the days after his murder in Illinois. He said the attack on the young boy was \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d but also stressed that \u201cJewish people have been under attack in many places in this country for a long time.\u201d Garrett Haake For all the handwringing about Biden losing the support of Muslim and Arab-Americans due to his near-total embrace of Israel at this moment, some of the rhetoric here is telling in how unlikely it might be for those voters to find comfort in the GOP. DeSantis blasting \u201cso-called Islamophobia\u201d is a case in point. Marissa Parra NBC News is viewing the debate at a GOP watch party at a bar in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. In this Jacksonville room full of roughly 70 Republican Florida voters, there are two names you hear most when asking about their 2024 pick: Trump or Desantis. Most of the room has told me they regret the uniquely Floridian Republican problem of having to choose between a beloved governor and the former president, and wish they hadn\u2019t overlapped in a single presidential race. Die-hard Trump voter Trina Carver of Jacksonville wasn\u2019t a fan of DeSantis attacking Trump tonight. \u201cThe lack of loyalty bothers me,\u201d said Carver. \u201cBut Trump doesn\u2019t need to be on stage. The people who are for Trump are for Trump.\u201d Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has introduced legislation that would rescind federal funding for colleges and universities \u201cthat peddle antisemitism or authorize, fund or facilitate events that promote violent antisemitism,\u201d and often touts it on the campaign trail. Megan Lebowitz The Biden campaign has already started seizing on Republicans talking about election losses last night, including tweeting a video of Vivek saying \u201cwe\u2019ve become a party of losers.\u201d Jillian Frankel DeSantis has used variations of the \u201cI\u2019m canceling your visa and I\u2019m sending you home\u201d line multiple times on the trail in Iowa when talking about antisemitism on college campuses lately. Shirley Zilberstein Haley has been talking about using her heels as ammunition for a long time. She even mentioned them in her campaign launch video: \u201cI don\u2019t put up with bullies, and when you kick back, it hurts them more when you\u2019re wearing heels\u201d  Alex Tabet Context for DeSantis' comments about Cooper Union: Jewish students at Cooper Union College in New York City said they feared violence by pro-Palestinian protesters and took refuge from demonstrators in a school library. New York police said protesters banged on the doors and glass windows of the building but contradicted the claim that the students were locked inside. Phil Prazan Texas has the third amount of active duty armed forces members, roughly around 115,000. Only California and Virginia have more.   So, if we\u2019re talking about more troops overseas \u2014 many of them will be Texans. Also, it\u2019s a reason why there was a decent amount of support during the 2008 presidential election for anti-war candidate Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Alec Hern\u00e1ndez DeSantis has said that U.S. troops stationed in Syria and Iraq are \"there in insufficient numbers to probably make a huge impact. But they\u2019re there in sufficient numbers to be an inviting target,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not clear what their mission is.\u201d Alex Tabet and Katherine Koretski Ramaswamy has long said that \u201cthe right answer to bad speech or bad opinions, isn\u2019t censorship, it\u2019s more speech.\u201d On the trail recently, he has referenced the Brooklyn Bridge protests but has said he believes they don\u2019t even know what is going on in the Middle East. He has defended the protesters as an act of free speech. He often says on the trail: \u201cAnd if you repeatedly ... tell people they cannot speak, that is when they scream. If you repeatedly tell people they cannot scream, that is when they tear things down.\" Maura Barrett When Ramaswamy named dropped his first book, Haley appears to roll her eyes and turns her head to share a knowing glance with Christie. Scott Bland Context for Ramaswamy pivoting from an Israel question to attack his rivals: He has been getting hammered by his GOP opponents over being insufficiently supportive of Israel. So he took time out from answering a question about an issue that\u2019s caused trouble for him to get to his own attacks before someone hits him first. Phil Prazan Speaking of high heels and Haley\u2019s response \u2014 reminds me of a quote from Ann Richards, who later became governor of Texas, at the 1988 DNC Convention: \u201cAfter all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.\u201d Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Ginger Gibson and Olympia Sonnier In the first 15 minutes, Ramaswamy has gone after three different women: Ronna McDaniel, moderator Welker and opponent Haley. And he keeps taking digs at the heels, including trying to jab \u2014 it seems \u2014 at DeSantis for wearing boots with heels. Rumors and memes abound about DeSantis\u2019 allegedly wearing lifts in his boots to make him taller. And those make the boots\u2019 toes curl up. Dasha Burns and Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley is making a career out of punchy one-liner retorts to Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s attacks \u201cThey\u2019re 5-inch heels, and I don\u2019t wear them unless I can run in them,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not fashion \u2014 they\u2019re ammunition.\" Nikki Haley making clear she\u2019s not going to just take the dig without giving it back. Lauren Mayk Some candidates are tapping into Republican frustration over Tuesday's election losses. In Pennsylvania, Republicans lost a contest for an open Supreme Court seat that would have narrowed the margin in a Democratic-controlled court to one justice, plus they lost other court and county-level races. The GOP frustration is going public in some cases: In a social media post earlier today, a former Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate who co-founded a group called Win Again that embraces mail-in voting called the results for Republican candidates a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said they demonstrate the complete failure of the leadership and institutions that conservative voters, activists and donors rely on. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has been accusing both Obama and Biden of creating a market for American hostages on the campaign trail. He\u2019s said Biden has blood on his hands due to the $6 billion Iran hostage deal, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s levied the attack toward Obama. Joe Murphy In the first debate it took 10 minutes for a candidate to attack another candidate on the stage. In the second debate it took more than 20 minutes. We\u2019re more than 16 minutes into the third debate and Ramaswamy just took a swing at Haley over her business ties, the first attack on another on-stage candidate in the third debate. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jonathan Liptak from Keene voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but does not like that he is not participating in the debates. He has not decided whom to support yet. Ramaswamy, he said, \"said what we are all thinking with regards to the mainstream media and the chairwoman of the RNC.\" Phil Prazan In Texas, there\u2019s a relatively small number of Jewish people \u2014 around 1%, according to PEW Research. Many Texans view Israel through either a national security lens or through the evangelical Christian end-times prophecy beliefs.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Adam Edelman Right out of the gate, both DeSantis and Ramaswamy blasted their fellow Republicans for having lost so many contests on Tuesday night. But they didn\u2019t mention their party\u2019s struggles with abortion rights \u2014 which was, perhaps, the biggest factor in Republicans losing those races. \u201cWhat we saw last night, I\u2019m sick of Republicans losing,\u201d DeSantis said. Ramaswamy called the GOP a \u201cparty of losers\u201d that got \u201ctrounced last night.\u201d Republican candidates suffered losses Tuesday night in the Virginia legislative elections and the Kentucky gubernatorial race. In those races, Democrats put abortion rights front and center. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in Ohio enshrining abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution also passed. The results were just the latest examples in a still unbroken winning streak by candidates and ballot measures supporting abortion rights in the nearly 17 months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and further highlighted Republican struggles on the issue.  Natasha Korecki Ramaswamy here is separating himself from DeSantis and Haley on Israel, saying he would concentrate on the U.S. southern border. He also hit Haley hard as he has been in the last several weeks on Israel, saying, \u201cDo you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels?\u201d Alec Hern\u00e1ndez That DeSantis anecdote about the young evacuee from Israel is a staple on the campaign trail. DeSantis has flexed his official government position to support his campaign message since the war broke out \u2014 tightening sanctions on Iran with the Florida legislature, evacuating Americans on Florida Division of Emergency Management flights and sending medical aid and supplies to Israel. Alexandra Marquez As the candidates answer questions about the Israel-Hamas war, likely Iowa caucusgoers are paying attention. In our latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, 57% of likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers said that the Israel-Hamas war is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as they evaluate candidates. Alex Tabet Ramaswamy has long spread the conspiracy theory that we\u2019re only in Ukraine because of Hunter Biden. Natasha Korecki DeSantis has been working hard the last several weeks to take action on Israel from Florida and he makes sure to get that across just now. Phil Prazan Tim Scott leans into faith and religion in his answer on moving the GOP away from Trump. According to Pew Research, 77% of adults in Texas are Christian. The largest subset of Christians is Evangelical Protestants \u2014 with 31% of the state. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Katherine Koretski Ramaswamy posted on X just now regarding his debate opening answer, calling on GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel to resign: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this Republican Establishment that has made us a party of losers. Where is the accountability for years of losing: 2018, 2020, 2022 and now last night? I\u2019m calling on @GOPChairwoman to resign tonight.\u201d Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jacob Favolise, 20, is a Republican from Keene, supporting Gov. Chris Christie. His immediate reaction to the first debate question: \u201cJust remember who was calling out Donald Trump before it was cool: Chris Christie\u201d Chuck Todd The best thing the first question did was separate the candidates between those who are running to be the GOP nominee and those who are running for their own personal reasons or gain. Jillian Frankel In her first response of the night, Haley mentioned needing an accountant in the White House, an appeal that might resonate especially well with Iowa Republicans, who say the economy is a top voting issue ahead of the Jan. 15 caucus, according to our most recent NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. Allan Smith and Jason Abbruzzese Ramaswamy wasn\u2019t joking about being \u201cunconstrained.\u201d He immediately picked two targets that many GOP voters love to jeer: RNC chair Ronna McDaniel and the media and decided to take his time to blast them rather than explain why he should be the nominee. It's red meat for his online supporters. Phil Prazan From an early September poll: 41% of Texas voters have a favorable view of Trump, while 51% had an unfavorable view. 79% of Republicans have a FAVORABLE view. Trump is by far the choice of Texas Republicans so far. Their views on the recent criminal charges against him have not changed that. 85% of Texas GOP voters believe the charges against Trump are \u201cmostly based on politics,\u201d as opposed to \u201cmostly based on the facts.\u201d Only 5% of Texas GOP voters don\u2019t know or are unsure. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Dasha Burns Interesting to see Ramaswamy is in a fighting mood tonight \u2014 but so far not looking to pick a fight with his opponents like he did at the first debate. In the second debate he tried on the \u201cuniter\u201d brand. Now he\u2019s trying out fighting with the moderators. Maura Barrett I am sitting in the audience with a clear view of Ronna McDaniels \u2014 when Ramaswamy called her out and offered to yield his spot on the stage to take ownership for Republican losses, she started to get out of her chair, clearly frustrated with the accusation, before she sat back down. She remains in her seat now. Garrett Haake Ramaswamy's campaign warned he would try to start trouble today: \u201cVivek speaks the truth. If he\u2019s going to make people on the debate stage uncomfortable and they\u2019re gonna get mad and maybe we\u2019ll see some mics cut off,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin told me today. \u201cBut he\u2019s ready and he\u2019s not going hold back. He\u2019s gonna be unconstrained.\u201d Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Joe Pendergast, 69, was a Gov. Doug Burgum fan who\u2019s bummed he didn\u2019t make the stage tonight. \u201cI really wanted him to be able to express himself unlike the last debate where they didn\u2019t let him even talk,\u201d Pendergast said of the North Dakota governor. Since Burgum didn\u2019t qualify for the debate, Pendergast is taking a fresh look at Haley. Pendergast, who\u2019s now retired, says he\u2019s been impressed by Haley\u2019s debate performances thus far and is expecting her to come out swinging again tonight. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna take any prisoners and I think she\u2019s gonna be very aggressive tonight,\u201d predicted Pendergast. Katherine Koretski and Alex Tabet Vivek Ramaswamy goes after the Republican National Committee in his first answer. On the trail, he has said he's using the Republican Party as a \u201cvehicle\u201d to win the nomination. He has had a longstanding beef with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. Jane C. Timm \u201cIt cracks me up that Ron continues to do this. He has opposed fracking. He\u2019s opposed drilling,\u201d Haley said today. \u201cHe was praised by the Sierra Club, and you\u2019re trying to make up for it and act like you weren\u2019t a liberal when it comes to the environment.\u201d This is mostly true. DeSantis's record as governor is more progressive than the records of the other candidates running for office. He has embraced protecting the Everglades and opposed fracking and drilling in Florida. In 2019, the Sierra Club they said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with one of his budgets. In more recent years, however, it has condemned his administration. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott said his girlfriend was at the debate, saying they\u2019ve been dating for several months and that she was at his campaign launch event. NBC News: \"Any special guests with you today?\" Scott: \"All my guests are special.\" NBC News: \"You were seen on the stage after the debate taking a photo. Any insight on who that was?\" Scott: \"Oh, my girlfriend.\" His campaign said her first name is Mindy. Megan Lebowitz Biden\u2019s campaign manager laid into the GOP candidates in a statement after the debate ended, tying the Republican candidates to Trump. \"Normally, after you lose, you take a moment to reflect and course correct,\" Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \"But in Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA Republican Party, apparently you double down on the same extreme agenda that was soundly rejected last night in elections across the country.\" She said that in 2024, voters will choose between Biden and \u201cMAGA Republicans, whose policy platform is to make things worse for you by taking away your freedoms.\u201d Vaughn Hillyard Trump will not attend the fourth debate in December in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita said. LaCivita added the caveat that he has used for previous debates: \u201cUntil he is.\u201d Katherine Koretski Notably, the RNC is not holding the Ramaswamy sign in the spin room. It\u2019s his body man, Patrick. Ramaswamy went after the RNC and its chairwoman hard tonight. Sahil Kapur DeSantis, on NBC News Now, says his view of the GOP primary electorate is: 25% are all in for Trump, 25% have moved on and want an alternative, and 50% are open. He indicated his focus is on the 50%. Sahil Kapur On his home turf at the Republican presidential debate in Miami, DeSantis sharpened his case against Trump and tussled with Haley as she looked to build on her momentum. Five candidates met on stage Wednesday night, just over two months before voting begins: DeSantis, Haley, Scott, Ramaswamy and Christie. Absent for the third time was Trump, the former president who is dominating the GOP polls so far \u2014 and continued his debate counterprogramming tradition with a rally in nearby Hialeah. While DeSantis and Haley are competing for second place and a shot at being the main GOP alternative to Trump, the other three are fighting to keep their candidacies alive. Here are some key takeaways from the debate. Brian Cheung \u201cPrices are going up,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cBut wages have remained flat.\u201d  This is half true. Americans made average hourly earnings of $34 per hour in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s up 4.1% from $32.66 the year prior and up 19% from $28.55 in February 2020, just before the pandemic swept the U.S. BLS data shows that consumer prices overall are indeed rising, though at a sharply slower pace than a year ago. They are up 3.7% over the last year, and up 19% since February 2020. But many price categories have fallen from earlier peaks. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk rose from $3.19 in November 2019 to $4.20 in May 2022, but settled back at $3.97 this fall. Peter W. Klein Ramaswamy said tonight that he would focus on both the southern and northern border in effort to combat the fentanyl crisis in America. \u201cThere was enough fentanyl that was captured just on the northern border last year to kill 3 million Americans. So we got to just skate to where the puck is going, not just where the puck is. Don\u2019t just build the wall, build both walls.\u201d This is largely false. The DEA reported 14 pounds of fentanyl seized on the Canadian border in 2022, out of 14,700 pounds seized throughout the U.S. The 3 million number is likely based on the DEA\u2019s estimate that one kilogram of fentanyl could kill up to 500,000 people. So while it\u2019s true that the amount of fentanyl seized from Canada could technically kill up to 3 million, the focus on Canada seems unwarranted given that it represents one-thousandth of 1 percent of seizures. It is worth noting that, with his skating metaphor, he was referring to the great Canadian hockey star Wayne Gretzky\u2019s best-known quote.  Watch: The candidates delivered closing remarks. Katie Primm Haley got the most questions. Scott spoke the longest. Here's how it all broke down. Question Count (Note this includes follow-ups if the candidate didn\u2019t answer the initial question) Total Speaking Time (Note this includes questions, follow-ups, opening & closing statements and interruptions.) Jason Abbruzzese Ramaswamy's on-stage combativeness appears to have paid off, as he\u2019s the top trending topic on X in the U.S. at the moment. Note: Another trending hashtag, #TellUsNicki, refers to Nicki Minaj, not Nikki Haley. Sarah Mimms After the debate ended, Ramaswamy walked right past Haley to shake Christie\u2019s hand \u2014 and Ramaswamy appeared to greet all of his opponents but her before walking off. Haley didn't make eye contact with him either as both spoke to their opponents and then greeted family members. Nigel Chiwaya, Joe Murphy and Chet Hill Ramaswamy was not the target he was in the first two debates. See the debate attack tracker. Jane C. Timm Scott said he would ban abortions from occurring \u201cup until the day of birth\u201d and \"certainly wouldn't allow\" the infanticide he said a Democratic governor had talked about. Scott's claims are misleading. The vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester. In 2020, just 0.9 percent of abortions occurred after 21 weeks of gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abortions after the point of viability are often due to severe congenital abnormalities or maternal complications. Ninety-three percent of abortions in 2020 occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. Infanticide is already illegal. Then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made controversial remarks about giving families choices on resuscitating dying infants. Trump made a similar false claim during his 2019 State of the Union, and NBC News debunked it then. Dasha Burns Ramaswamy also brought up a theory that\u2019s been circulating through the GOP that Biden will not ultimately be the Democratic nominee. This unfounded theory has been big with Republicans lately. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Big applause at the Iowa watch party for Ramaswamy saying Biden isn\u2019t really president, echoing conspiracy theories. Maura Barrett And one final glance from Haley to Christie during Ramaswamy\u2019s closing remarks. That marks at least three from my watch in the debate hall. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Kyle Claire, 20, is a college Young Republican from the University of Iowa. Claire is a DeSantis fan who was jazzed about Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019 recent endorsement of the Florida governor. He\u2019s still considering Haley though, and feels like DeSantis waffled on his stance on Ukraine on the debate stage tonight. \u201cI think DeSantis needs to take a little bit stronger stance on Ukraine,\u201d said Claire, a junior studying political science. \"There\u2019s nothing more 'America First' than ensuring our security, and that includes ensuring the security of our allies, too.\" From Texas: Abortions in Texas have dropped significantly since Roe vs. Wade was overturned last year. The state already had one of the strictest laws and now abortions hardly ever happen. According to this 2023 report from the Society of Family Planning, roughly 2,650 abortions were performed per month from April to June 2022 in the state. Then came Dobbs in June 2022. From then until December 2022, 10 abortions were performed per month.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Maura Barrett During the last commercial break, spouses & family of the candidates warmly greet one another and catch up as they gather to go to the spin room, a stark contrast to the awkward group photo the candidates seemingly didn\u2019t want to engage in when they came on stage at the top of the program. Jillian Frankel To clarify, Ramaswamy said that Issue 1 in Ohio will codify the right to an abortion all the way up to the time of birth, but actually the new amendment to the state constitution will prohibit abortion after fetal viability except when the mother\u2019s life or health is at risk. Adam Edelman The candidates are all arguing over a national 15-week abortion ban. But just last night voters in Virginia rejected the same proposal in awarding control of the state\u2019s two legislative chambers to Democrats. Gov. Glenn Youngkin put the proposal \u2014 which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother \u2014 at the center of his effort to help Republicans gain control of state government. Strategists had viewed the proposal as a test message for Republicans looking for a moderate reproductive rights policy and message to run on. And it failed. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jonathan Liptak, from Keene, New Hampshire said, \u201cRon had a great abortion answer. Pro-life is a losing argument, as seen in the last 2 elections. Most abortions happen under 12 weeks, and most people would support a 16-week ban. Absolutely not until labor. That should be the message to GOP and voters.\u201d Bianca Seward Jennifer Baier in Dallas County, Iowa, said she favored Haley\u2019s abortion position best of the candidates and was frustrated by the hard stance of the others. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re trying to legislate morality, and that\u2019s never been the business of the government,\u201d she said. Abigail Brooks Scott\u2019s answer here highlights the gray area where a lot of Americans live on abortion: They oppose total bans, but the further along a pregnancy is, the fewer Americans support abortion, per Pew. Lauren Mayk Abortion played a role in the heated and expensive race for an open seat on Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court between Democrat Dan McCaffery and Republican Carolyn Carluccio. Democrat McCaffery won yesterday 53-47. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has used his support for a 15-week federal abortion limit to differentiate himself from, and call out, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. At the last debate, he asked DeSantis on the stage if he\u2019d sign a federal ban as president. Phil Prazan It is illegal to perform an abortion in Texas, including mailing an abortion-inducing pill like mifepristone in most cases. There is a very narrow exception \u2014 only to save the life of the mother or to stop a \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d There\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit over the latest law because abortion providers and women seeking abortions are confused about what is allowed under that very narrow exception.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Gabe Conley, 30, came to the watch party unsure if he was going to caucus for Ramaswamy or DeSantis. After tonight\u2019s performance, he\u2019s leaning toward Ramaswamy. \u201cEveryone else on that stage is a neoconservative, traditional status quo moderate,\u201d said Conley. Conley says he likes Ramaswamy\u2019s fighting spirit. \u201cHe\u2019s coming out with that same energy that Trump had in those debates, and any student of history knows that that went pretty well for Trump,\u201d said Conley, a resident physician from Cherokee, Iowa. Chet Hill, Nigel Chiwaya and Joe Murphy Biden's leading all the off-stage targets in attacks a little more than 90 minutes into the debate. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker. Natasha Korecki and Dasha Burns Natasha Korecki says: Haley stands out in this crowd for taking a more moderate approach on abortion, asking to find consensus on the issue. She said tonight what she\u2019s said in the past: There will be no federal ban because there aren\u2019t 60 votes for one. Adds Dasha Burns: Haley is perhaps the most moderate candidate on the stage when it comes to abortion rights. Listening to her language might be an indication of how Republicans start to change their messaging after seeing losses like last night. From Texas: Texas Republican voters want fewer people coming into the country period. Even when it comes to legal immigration, according to the Texas Politics Project, in 2022, 61% of Republican voters believe there are \u201ctoo many\u201d people coming to Texas legally. A candidate cannot talk tough enough on immigration and border security to make inroads with Texas GOP primary voters. Even in the state government, 61% of Republican voters in August 2023 said the state was spending too little on border security. For context: Texas leaders have spent roughly $12 billion on border security and Gov. Abbott\u2019s Operation Lone Star in the last few years. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Brian Cheung Sen. Tim Scott said gas prices are \u201c40% higher right now than they were just a little over two years ago,\u201d but government data shows prices are about the same now as they were in November 2021. This is false. A gallon of regular gas costs about $3.40 per gallon on average this week, compared with $3.41 per gallon in November 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Prices did spike over the course of 2022 (to as high as $5 per gallon in June 2022), due in part to the war in Ukraine, but have since come down. Garrett Haake Haley\u2019s most sustained applause in the room of the evening came on that abortion answer. Lauren Mayk Philadelphia recorded more than 1,400 deaths to overdoses in 2022, an 11% jump from 2021, per the city\u2019s health department. The Kensington section of the city has become known for its visible drug use and open-air drug market \u2014 and political candidates including Mehmet Oz and Vivek Ramaswamy have documented trips there.   Recently, Mayor-elect Cherelle Parker said the National Guard could be part of a \u201ccomprehensive approach\u201d to address crime and drug issues there. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Abigail Brooks Pro-abortion rights advocates are trying to get a ballot initiative going in Florida in 2024, much like the one that passed in Ohio last night. Dasha Burns DeSantis often implies that abortion rights issues should remain with the states, but he has not been clear about what he would or would not do at the federal level. Dasha Burns The first question on abortion goes to DeSantis \u2014 who signed a 6-week abortion ban here in Florida. Allan Smith Ramaswamy calling for a border wall along the U.S. border with Canada. Didn\u2019t have that one on the bingo card. Phil Prazan Immigration and border security are the TOP issues for Texas GOP primary voters. The state has the most contiguous miles along the Mexican border; state lawmakers know this and act accordingly. Yesterday, state lawmakers were called back to a fourth special session by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott. Republican lawmakers aim to pass a law allowing local and state police in Texas to arrest people they believe crossed into the state illegally. There was a policy difference between that item in the third special session but with the latest news from today, that detail seems to be worked out. Expect that law to pass and be immediately challenged by immigrant rights groups. It was filed in the third special session as HB 4 by Rep. David Spiller, R \u2014 Jacksboro. It led to a heated, all-night session a few weeks ago. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, says she doesn\u2019t care what her friends at the U.N. would say if she sends in special operations into Mexico to target cartels. She has long said she would take a two-pronged approach to fentanyl, special operations in Mexico and suspending trade relations with China until they stop flooding the U.S. with it. Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns DeSantis\u2019 \u201cstone cold dead\u201d line usually gets big applause on the trail in Iowa. Abigail Brooks Fentanyl deaths are a big part of DeSantis\u2019 stump speech, but the anecdotes he tells are usually like the one he just told: focused on people who accidentally take drugs laced with fentanyl, and not focused on addiction. Alana Satlin Big applause for Christie after his answer on fentanyl, noting that he thinks addiction should be treated like a disease. Lauren Mayk Florida has about 542,000 residents receiving Social Security (about 229,000 age 65 and over). Pennsylvania has about 325,000 (82,000 age 65 and over), per federal data. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Jason Abbruzzese Google Trends offers a sense of who is generating interest during the debate, and so far it's Haley and Ramawamy, followed by DeSantis, Christie and Scott. DeSantis had the single biggest spike, while Haley has had at least six distinct bumps. Allan Smith To sum up this debate so far: A bunch of candidates who significantly trail Trump \u2014 and are running out of time to make up the deficit \u2014 are offering shortened versions of their campaign stump speech, attacking each other and, aside from the first question, almost entirely ignoring the man they have to beat to win. One way to measure how little Trump has come up in tonight\u2019s debate: The fact Christie has yet to get booed during an answer. Olympia Sonnier TeamTrump hitting Ron DeSantis on Medicare and Social Security, as they have throughout the campaign, even before DeSantis announced. This and disloyalty to Trump have been their main points of attack throughout the campaign, as they try to draw older Florida voters to their camp. Phil Prazan More on energy in Texas: While many see the state as just an oil and gas state, it\u2019s way more interesting and complex. Because of then-Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s policies from years ago, solar and wind power are pretty common in the state. Just look at today, according to the largest Texas power grid \u2014 ERCOT, 29.4 percent of the power generated in Texas today was from wind power. Natural gas is still the leader with 47.7%. Coal comes in at 15.4% and nuclear comes in at 7.4%. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Abigail Brooks and Alec Hern\u00e1ndez DeSantis actually got some laughs in the debate hall with that Social Security joke, a subtle nod to the masses of retirees living out their golden years in his home state. That lighter moment is straight out of DeSantis\u2019 stump speech. His joke about knowing a few Social Security recipients usually gets laughs on the campaign trail, too. Jason Abbruzzese A Laffer Curve reference! The economics wonks must be buzzing. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Rita Mattson, 67, is an undecided voter from Dublin, New Hampshire. \u201cSocial Security is NOT an entitlement,\" she said. \"Stop giving it to people who don\u2019t deserve it.\" Peter W. Klein \"I believe that we have sleeper terrorist cells in America. Thousands of people have come from Yemen, Iran, Syria and Iraq,\" Scott said Wednesday. This is not supported by evidence. While Scott said he \u201cbelieves\u201d there are sleeper cells, he did not cite any evidence, and there is scant proof of any such sleeper cells. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda have called for the establishment of sleeper cells, but they have largely been debunked. After a U.S. airstrike killed Iran\u2019s military leader Qassem Soleimani, there were fears that Hezbollah sleeper cells might be activated, but there is no evidence of any such activity. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Ramaswamy and Scott seemed to be laughing and fist-bumping each other through Haley\u2019s last answer. The two haven\u2019t exchanged attacks on the stage; it's a surprising show of camaraderie between the two. From Texas: When the candidates talk about energy, Texans listen intently \u2014 especially in the largest Texas county of Harris County. Harris County and the surrounding area are home to all three of the \u201cbig three\u201d leaders in state government: Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Speaker Dade Phelan. Sen. Ted Cruz is also from Harris County. Southeast Texas is the energy sector of the state, where the Houston ship channel is the main port in and out. According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association, there may be 1.4 million jobs in the energy sector. While the jobs used to be concentrated solely in the oil industry \u2014 with special attention to the Permian basin around Midland and Odessa. However, now, Texas is also a natural gas state. Many gas companies are based in Houston, so the nods to fracking will be noticed in Southeast Texas. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Victoria Gulla, 50, from Spofford, New Hampshire, said, Ramaswamy \"is the most annoying. Again.\u201d Gulla\u2019s thoughts on the debate so far: \u201cSo far I think there is a clear dichotomy between the policies of the past and the now. Haley, Scott and Christie are living in the past with their wars everywhere. DeSantis on the right track with more peace through strength, let Europe lead on their front, and take care of business at home (border), while supporting our allies in ways that don\u2019t involve our troops.\u201d She is supporting DeSantis. Peter W. Klein \u201cMy message to [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is this, you are done buying land in this country,\" said Ramaswamy. \u201cChina is buying our farmland,\u201d Scott said. This is largely false. While state and federal lawmakers have been pushing to restrict Chinese purchases of land in America, a recent NBC News data analysis of real estate purchases filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed fewer than 1,400 acres were purchased by China in the past year and a half, out of 1.3 billion acres of agricultural land. A third of foreign-owned acres of U.S. land are held by Canadian interests, while Chinese interests hold just three-hundredths of 1%. Jason Abbruzzese Warren Buffett is somehow catching strays. Chuck Todd and Garrett Haake Chuck Todd says: If it wasn\u2019t for the first specific question asking about Trump, I\u2019m struggling to think of too many other times where any of them have gone after Trump\u2026 only each other. Garrett Haake responds: I\u2019m reminded of our polling from over the summer that attacking Trump is the least popular action a candidate can take. They begrudgingly did it early and are clearly hoping they won\u2019t have to again Bianca Seward The DeSantis war room X account has focused all of their posts during tonight\u2019s debate on Nikki Haley attacks and no other candidates. Haley just caught up to DeSantis in Iowa according to our NBC/Des Moines Register poll. Jason Abbruzzese Worth noting on the energy debate: The U.S. recently hit an all-time high in oil production. Jane C. Timm Criticizing American support for Ukraine\u2019s war on Russia, Ramaswamy said U.S. dollars are funding \u201cthe banning of Christians,\u201d mentioning the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This is misleading. Ukraine has taken steps to ban pro-Russia groups for months, taking steps to ban the activities of religious and political groups with ties to Russia. Last month the Ukrainian parliament took steps to ban the operations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has close ties to Moscow. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church split with the Russian Orthodox Church in May 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Olympia Sonnier TeamTrump's X account has been putting out Trump policy videos or opposition research on DeSantis that are following the topics of the debate: China, TikTok, antisemitism in colleges and trade. From Texas: Despite some recent good economic numbers, many Texans don\u2019t feel like the economy is doing well. What\u2019s interesting in trends from UT\u2019s Texas Politics Project \u2014 Republican voters in Texas view the economy through a partisan lens. In Feb. 2020, when Trump was in office, 84% of GOP Texas voters thought the economy was better than the year before. That number plummeted to 14% by Feb. 2021, when Biden was in office. The numbers began to go down steeply during the Covid pandemic but then never recovered. Meanwhile, the number of Texas Republicans who believe the economy is worse than a year before is now at 75% despite the recent good numbers. A lot of this may be their media diet but the result is clear: Texas Republicans believe the economy is in the tank Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Ginger Gibson You can feel the difference of having less candidates on the stage this time. The punchiness of Ramaswamy and Haley has less lost moments with the struggling candidates interjecting. Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Angela Boelens came to the debate watch party with two Ukrainian refugees, Liana Avetisian and Alina Mirzoian, whom she helped resettle into their new lives in Dewitt, Iowa. Boelens and the refugees were visibly disgusted by how Vivek Ramaswamy characterized the Ukrainian government. \u201cIt scares me knowing that there\u2019s a lot of Americans out there who don\u2019t know the facts and don\u2019t know how to fact-check the man,\u201d said Boelens of Ramaswamy\u2019s depiction of Ukraine as a corrupt nation. Boelens, who is supporting Nikki Haley in the upcoming Iowa caucuses, said she was impressed by the way her favorite candidate talked about Ukraine. \u201cI think that the smart, savvy candidates like Nikki Haley, and even Chris Christie, I think they understand the connection between how we\u2019re perceived around the world in terms of backing up and supporting these democracies.\u201d Jackie Nespral On the question of Trump's and Biden's different policy approaches to the Maduro regime: DeSantis said that he would reinstate the Trump sanctions and not rely on Venezuelan oil. This is something that resonates with the South Florida community because there is a large Venezuelan community here. South Florida has the largest Venezuelan community in the country. Jackie Nespral is the main anchor for NBC6 in Miami and the host of Impact, a politics and current events show. Abigail Brooks A GOP operative texts me: \u201cIf Nikki goes over and punches Vivek in the face, her poll numbers would shoot up.\u201d Joe Murphy, Chet Hill and Nigel Chiwaya A little more than an hour in and Christie and Scott have yet to be attacked. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Tim Scott\u2019s mother, Frances, who he referred to in this answer, is in the audience. She\u2019s attended all three debates. Olympia Sonnier Someone in Trump-world is watching the debate. Trump adviser Jason Miller tweets out Trump video \u201cAvoiding World War III\u201d with the caption: \"The JV gang took the bait and is missing the point here. Only President Trump knows this about AVOIDING World War III, not pushing us headfirst into it!\u201d Phil Prazan From Texas: Haley and Ramaswamy going back and forth here is a fight over a relatively small amount of Texans. Both candidates don\u2019t have a major presence in Texas. Last week, University of Houston and Texas Southern University: 58% of Texas 2024 GOP primary voters still intend to vote for Trump. Number two is DeSantis with 14% \u2014 according to Axios Houston. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Kristen Reynolds, 61, from Swanzey, New Hampshire, started the night thinking Ramaswamy was \u201cfunny and on point.\u201d Now, she says: \u201cVivek needs to stop attacking Nikki.\u201d David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, there are some plausible paths forward, including congressional action, executive action and a push to sell the app. Read more here. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has long rejected the notion of banning TikTok, citing past attempts by the Trump administration that were shot down by the courts. He\u2019s instead proposed requiring \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling on all apps and boosting parental controls. Abigail Brooks, Garrett Haake, Allan Smith and Olympia Sonnier Loud boos and mutters of \u201cOh, Jesus\u201d from within the debate hall as Ramaswamy takes a swipe at Nikki Haley\u2019s daughter for using TikTok. He\u2019s played the heel well up until now, with the room at best divided over his more controversial comments. He lost the room there. Haley shoots back, calling him \"scum\" and warning him not to go after her daughter (who is an adult and currently in the audience.) Phil Prazan In Texas, the kids like TikTok a lot more than their parents or grandparents, according to April polling on the issue. The poll found 43% of Texans get their news from local television stations, according to UT-Austin\u2019s Texas Politics Project. And 42% of Texans get their news from social media including TikTok; 52% of GOP voters 30 years old or younger have a positive view of TikTok. According to a poll from February, 64% of Texans 18-29 used TikTok in the last month. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Jake Traylor On stage in Hileah, Florida, Trump seemingly talking about Ramaswamy: \u201cA lot of people say that. Why are you running? He said I\u2019m a younger version. It\u2019s OK to say but we want the older version, right?\u201d David Ingram and Kat Tenbarge Critics have alleged that TikTok is using its influence to push content that is pro-Palestinian and contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. The claims about TikTok\u2019s promotion of pro-Palestinian content are anecdotal, and they have been bubbling up on the social media platform X, in statements to the media and on conservative media outlets such as Fox News.  TikTok said the allegations of bias are baseless.  Ultimately the perceived performance of pro-Palestinian content on the platform depends on how you parse TikTok\u2019s data. Historic trends internationally show more interest in the popular hashtag #standwithpalestine than #standwithisrael. Looking at hashtag data only from the U.S. over the last 30 days, pro-Israel content has been performing at pace, if not better, than some popular pro-Palestinian content.  Read the full story here. Olympia Sonnier In the last 10 minutes, the Trump campaign has sent out three emails highlighting his record on immigration and his \u201cplan to destroy the drug cartels.\u201d Megan Lebowitz A Biden campaign official told me campaign folks are mostly watching Trump right now. The source said they are bored with the debate and watching Trump ramble about \u201cthe same insane things that got him voted out in 2020.\u201d Maura Barrett During the commercial break, when candidates dispersed momentarily, DeSantis went to approach the edge of the stage and tripped/stumbled off the podium platform \u2014 catching himself before what honestly made me nervous could have been a face plant. He laughed it off before saying hello to his wife. David Ingram A question on TikTok comes as the popular video platform, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has re-entered the crosshairs of politicians and national security officials  TikTok has been the subject of scrutiny for years because of concerns that people in China may access the personal data of American users. Most recently, members of Congress and people in the tech industry have criticized TikTok because of pro-Palestinian content on the platform. TikTok has fended off attempts at a ban. Federal judges blocked a proposed ban by then-President Donald Trump in 2020, and TikTok has been negotiating an agreement with the Biden administration to try to allay data privacy concerns. This week, the Treasury Department declined to comment on the status of those negotiations. Chet Hill, Nigel Chiwaya and Joe Murphy At the 50-minute mark in the debate, DeSantis has made the most attacks. Jake Traylor Trump, on his own stage, said someone accused him of not having the courage to debate. \u201cWell, listen, I\u2019m standing in front of tens of thousands of people right now and it\u2019s on television. That\u2019s a hell of a lot harder to do than a debate,\" he said. Bianca Seward At the first break, Christie and Haley shared a quick smile while Ramaswamy shook DeSantis\u2019 hand and the two briefly chatted. Adam Edelman During an exchange about how the candidates would handle responding to Muslim Americans afraid for their safety in the current environment, Christie said he was one of the only persons on stage who \u201cactually had experience in dealing with this\u201d and pointed to his dealings as governor of the \u201cmost ethnically diverse state.\u201d Following 9/11, Christie said: \u201cI personally went from mosque to mosque in New Jersey and met with the leaders of those mosques and with the members of the mosques. And I said to law enforcement is on your side to protect you regardless of your religion.\u201d \u201cWe developed fabulous relationships with Muslim Americans all across the state of New Jersey,\u201d he said. It\u2019s true that Christie was applauded by the Muslim-American community during the first several years of his time in office. In particular, he was praised for slamming the New York Police Department\u2019s program that spied on Muslim communities.  But years later, in 2015, during his first presidential run, Muslim American communities widely criticized him for saying he wouldn\u2019t re-settle Syrian refugees in New Jersey or in the U.S. Chuck Todd Haley is clearly the most comfortable on these foreign policy topics than any of her competitors on stage. And if major donors are watching that are deciding between DeSantis and Haley as their preferred Trump alternative, this has likely been a very strong opening 45 minutes for Haley. This is not to say DeSantis has done poorly, he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s been much stronger tonight than at any of the previous debates. Haley simply has more experience debating these topics thanks specifically to her experience at the U.N. And on the showmanship front, the attention-seeking shenanigans of Ramaswamy that Haley has gleefully swatted away have also helped. Jake Traylor Trump just referred to the debate for the first time on stage at his rally tonight: \u201cIn the primary, we\u2019re leading the field with an average of 61% for Trump, and you have about what seven or eight candidates left. I think they\u2019re at a debate tonight. Nobody\u2019s talking about it. Everybody\u2019s watching.\" He added, \"One more quote on the debate from Trump: \u201cYou know, the last debate was the lowest-rated debate in the history of politics. So therefore, do you think we did the right thing by not participating?\u201d Garrett Haake In 2015, Hewitt\u2019s questions about the nuclear triad famously tripped up candidate Trump, who clearly had no idea what Hewitt was referring to. Here, as he asks candidates about building up the Navy, both Scott and DeSantis similarly whiff when asked about specific types of ships, size of the Navy, or when they could be built and deployed. Christie then tried to call them out for not answering. Dasha Burns and Natasha Korecki DeSantis hits Haley on giving China land when she was governor in South Carolina, she raised her hand, likely to talk about DeSantis\u2019 own entanglements with China. The two were duking it out on the issue as a prelude to the debate. His attacks echo ads that his SuperPAC has been running attacking Haley for how she handled China as governor. Katherine Koretski As Ramaswamy continuously goes after the RNC on stage and while on the trail, last month during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, NBC News asked Ramaswamy if he\u2019d ever consider running as an independent candidate for president. He answered with: \u201cI\u2019m in this to win and be our next president, and not even just to be the next president, but to reunite and re-galvanize this country. January 2033, is my destination. So the path that runs through there is winning the Republican nomination, and then winning the general election, which I expect to do.\u201d Also, Ramaswamy often says \u201cI\u2019m using the Republican Party as a vehicle because we live in a two party system.\u201d Natasha Korecki and Sarah Dean Natasha Korecki notes: Haley hits DeSantis for the first time when she called for the United States to suspend all regular trade relations with China unless it stops sending fentanyl \u2014 she says DeSantis has yet to do this. But Sarah Dean notes: Haley has gone after DeSantis less than expected based on her campaign\u2019s pre-debate memos previewing strategy. Instead, most of her attacks have been hits back at Vivek Ramaswamy going after her \u2014 leaving DeSantis largely unscathed so far. Alexandra Marquez China is another issue likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers are paying attention to. Our latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found that 50% of this group thinks that the issue of relations with China is \u201cextremely important,\u201d as they consider candidates. Dasha Burns Every debate the expectation has been DeSantis would attack or get attacked, but each time that doesn\u2019t seem to materialize. The campaign has claimed it\u2019s a good thing \u2014 he\u2019s being \u201cpresidential\u201d and \u201cabove the fray.\u201d But critics argue it makes him seem like less of a threat. Natasha Korecki and Garrett Haake Natasha Korecki observes: We\u2019re about five questions in and the most fire right now is between Ramaswamy and Haley and not Haley and DeSantis as expected. Garrett Haake responds: The coming DeSantis pile-on, now three debates in and yet to materialize Adam Edelman DeSantis appeared to pit a rise in antisemitism against a rise in Islamophobia, suggesting that one should be taken more seriously by the federal government than the other. Biden, he said, \u201cis launching an initiative to combat so-called Islamophobia.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s the antisemitism. It\u2019s spiraling out of control. That is what we have to confront,\u201d DeSantis said. The truth is that both Islamophobic incidents and antisemitic incidents have increased in the weeks since the Hamas attack on Israel. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said last week it received 774 reports of bias incidents and requests for help from Muslims across the U.S. from Oct. 7 to Oct. 24, a 182% jump from the average 16-day period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League said on Oct. 24 that there had been a \u201cnearly 400% increase in preliminary antisemitic incidents reported year-over-year.\u201d Lauren Mayk Haley says antisemitism is as bad as racism \u2014 worth noting that the Southern Poverty Law Center says antisemitism is \u201ca form of racism in itself.\u201d  Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Maura Barrett and Garrett Haake Maura Barrett observes: Another borderline eye roll & glance toward Christie from Haley when Ramaswamy claimed \u201cother people couldn\u2019t name\u201d the provinces of Ukraine that Russia has occupied Garrett Haake responds: It's not hard to imagine Christie as a Haley surrogate somewhere down the line. They\u2019re aligned on foreign policy in both style and substance. Natasha Korecki and Dasha Burns Despite his best efforts, Nikki Haley may have just had another moment by saying Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are salivating over the thought of Ramaswamy becoming president. Ramaswamy only seems to help Haley as a loose cannon foil to her seriousness. Phil Prazan According to a September poll from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, 36% of Texas voters believe the country is doing too much in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. That has gone up from 15% in 2022.  Meanwhile, 21% say the U.S. is doing too little. Thirty percent say the country is responding appropriately. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Chuck Todd Ramaswamy is like having a drunk uncle show up in the middle of a sober debate. Peter W. Klein \u201cBiden\u2019s neglect has been atrocious,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cHe left them stranded, they couldn\u2019t get flights out. So I scrambled resources in Florida. I sent planes over to Israel and I brought back over 700 people to safety.\u201d This is half true. The Biden administration initially told Americans in Israel to take advantage of commercial flights on Oct. 9, but flights from Israel to the U.S. were scarce and prices were reportedly as high as $25,000. Some Americans in Israel at the time posted on social media that they were stranded. On Oct. 12, DeSantis signed an executive order that allowed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to pay for Americans in Israel to fly back to the U.S. The flights, however, were organized by Tampa-based nonprofit Project Dynamo, which specializes in rescuing Americans in distress, and DeSantis\u2019 primary role was to fund the flights. On the same day, the U.S. announced they would help Americans evacuate on charter flights. Some 1,500 Americans did leave Israel with help from the U.S. government. U.S. citizens were responsible for paying for the government flights, while DeSantis footed the bill for his flights. Natasha Korecki and Katherine Koretski This is a common talking point for Ramaswamy when it comes to Ukraine. He often says just because Putin is bad doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine is good. But Ramaswamy saying that other candidates are coming around to his thinking on Ukraine and tiptoeing around funding for it, but this seems unlikely for Haley who has been a hawk on the situation. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has called on Biden to have a \u201csingle-minded\u201d focus on Israel and opposed his efforts to tie Israel funding to aid for Ukraine. He was a co-sponsor of the Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, which would provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel. Nigel Chiwaya, Chet Hill and Joe Murphy Thirty minutes into the third debate and most of the field is focusing their attacks on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker here. Allan Smith Just browsing social media, it seems the only line in this debate that\u2019s taken off so far is Ramaswamy blasting \u201cDick Cheney in 3-inch heels.\u201d He aimed that comment at both Haley and DeSantis. Phil Prazan With all this talk on national security and American funding for democratic allies fighting wars, Texas has a unique connection. Since 2001, many key decisions laying the groundwork for geopolitics in the Middle East were made by then-President and Texan George W. Bush \u2014 who sent American troops into a Mideast war. Expert on geopolitics, Ian Bremmer, argued the current crisis is partly a result of American power receding from the Middle East and pivoting toward Asia. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Lauren Mayk Nikki Haley is talking about college campuses as mom of a college student in Pennsylvania. She announced her son\u2019s choice of Villanova in the Philly burbs here in 2020. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley got a slightly different question on antisemitism, but she has also proposed going after universities by pulling their tax-exempt status if they allow hate speech on campus. She wants to change the official federal definition of antisemitism to include denying Israel\u2019s right to exist. Alec Hern\u00e1ndez I asked DeSantis at a campaign stop last month in South Carolina what his message would be to the family of Wadea Al-Fayoume in the days after his murder in Illinois. He said the attack on the young boy was \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d but also stressed that \u201cJewish people have been under attack in many places in this country for a long time.\u201d Garrett Haake For all the handwringing about Biden losing the support of Muslim and Arab-Americans due to his near-total embrace of Israel at this moment, some of the rhetoric here is telling in how unlikely it might be for those voters to find comfort in the GOP. DeSantis blasting \u201cso-called Islamophobia\u201d is a case in point. Marissa Parra NBC News is viewing the debate at a GOP watch party at a bar in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. In this Jacksonville room full of roughly 70 Republican Florida voters, there are two names you hear most when asking about their 2024 pick: Trump or Desantis. Most of the room has told me they regret the uniquely Floridian Republican problem of having to choose between a beloved governor and the former president, and wish they hadn\u2019t overlapped in a single presidential race. Die-hard Trump voter Trina Carver of Jacksonville wasn\u2019t a fan of DeSantis attacking Trump tonight. \u201cThe lack of loyalty bothers me,\u201d said Carver. \u201cBut Trump doesn\u2019t need to be on stage. The people who are for Trump are for Trump.\u201d Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has introduced legislation that would rescind federal funding for colleges and universities \u201cthat peddle antisemitism or authorize, fund or facilitate events that promote violent antisemitism,\u201d and often touts it on the campaign trail. Megan Lebowitz The Biden campaign has already started seizing on Republicans talking about election losses last night, including tweeting a video of Vivek saying \u201cwe\u2019ve become a party of losers.\u201d Jillian Frankel DeSantis has used variations of the \u201cI\u2019m canceling your visa and I\u2019m sending you home\u201d line multiple times on the trail in Iowa when talking about antisemitism on college campuses lately. Shirley Zilberstein Haley has been talking about using her heels as ammunition for a long time. She even mentioned them in her campaign launch video: \u201cI don\u2019t put up with bullies, and when you kick back, it hurts them more when you\u2019re wearing heels\u201d  Alex Tabet Context for DeSantis' comments about Cooper Union: Jewish students at Cooper Union College in New York City said they feared violence by pro-Palestinian protesters and took refuge from demonstrators in a school library. New York police said protesters banged on the doors and glass windows of the building but contradicted the claim that the students were locked inside. Phil Prazan Texas has the third amount of active duty armed forces members, roughly around 115,000. Only California and Virginia have more.   So, if we\u2019re talking about more troops overseas \u2014 many of them will be Texans. Also, it\u2019s a reason why there was a decent amount of support during the 2008 presidential election for anti-war candidate Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Alec Hern\u00e1ndez DeSantis has said that U.S. troops stationed in Syria and Iraq are \"there in insufficient numbers to probably make a huge impact. But they\u2019re there in sufficient numbers to be an inviting target,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not clear what their mission is.\u201d Alex Tabet and Katherine Koretski Ramaswamy has long said that \u201cthe right answer to bad speech or bad opinions, isn\u2019t censorship, it\u2019s more speech.\u201d On the trail recently, he has referenced the Brooklyn Bridge protests but has said he believes they don\u2019t even know what is going on in the Middle East. He has defended the protesters as an act of free speech. He often says on the trail: \u201cAnd if you repeatedly ... tell people they cannot speak, that is when they scream. If you repeatedly tell people they cannot scream, that is when they tear things down.\" Maura Barrett When Ramaswamy named dropped his first book, Haley appears to roll her eyes and turns her head to share a knowing glance with Christie. Scott Bland Context for Ramaswamy pivoting from an Israel question to attack his rivals: He has been getting hammered by his GOP opponents over being insufficiently supportive of Israel. So he took time out from answering a question about an issue that\u2019s caused trouble for him to get to his own attacks before someone hits him first. Phil Prazan Speaking of high heels and Haley\u2019s response \u2014 reminds me of a quote from Ann Richards, who later became governor of Texas, at the 1988 DNC Convention: \u201cAfter all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.\u201d Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Ginger Gibson and Olympia Sonnier In the first 15 minutes, Ramaswamy has gone after three different women: Ronna McDaniel, moderator Welker and opponent Haley. And he keeps taking digs at the heels, including trying to jab \u2014 it seems \u2014 at DeSantis for wearing boots with heels. Rumors and memes abound about DeSantis\u2019 allegedly wearing lifts in his boots to make him taller. And those make the boots\u2019 toes curl up. Dasha Burns and Natasha Korecki Nikki Haley is making a career out of punchy one-liner retorts to Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s attacks \u201cThey\u2019re 5-inch heels, and I don\u2019t wear them unless I can run in them,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not fashion \u2014 they\u2019re ammunition.\" Nikki Haley making clear she\u2019s not going to just take the dig without giving it back. Lauren Mayk Some candidates are tapping into Republican frustration over Tuesday's election losses. In Pennsylvania, Republicans lost a contest for an open Supreme Court seat that would have narrowed the margin in a Democratic-controlled court to one justice, plus they lost other court and county-level races. The GOP frustration is going public in some cases: In a social media post earlier today, a former Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate who co-founded a group called Win Again that embraces mail-in voting called the results for Republican candidates a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said they demonstrate the complete failure of the leadership and institutions that conservative voters, activists and donors rely on. Lauren Mayk covers politics for NBC 10 (WCAU), reporting throughout the Philadelphia region. She also hosts the Battleground Politics podcast. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Scott has been accusing both Obama and Biden of creating a market for American hostages on the campaign trail. He\u2019s said Biden has blood on his hands due to the $6 billion Iran hostage deal, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s levied the attack toward Obama. Joe Murphy In the first debate it took 10 minutes for a candidate to attack another candidate on the stage. In the second debate it took more than 20 minutes. We\u2019re more than 16 minutes into the third debate and Ramaswamy just took a swing at Haley over her business ties, the first attack on another on-stage candidate in the third debate. Follow along with the NBC News attack tracker. Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jonathan Liptak from Keene voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but does not like that he is not participating in the debates. He has not decided whom to support yet. Ramaswamy, he said, \"said what we are all thinking with regards to the mainstream media and the chairwoman of the RNC.\" Phil Prazan In Texas, there\u2019s a relatively small number of Jewish people \u2014 around 1%, according to PEW Research. Many Texans view Israel through either a national security lens or through the evangelical Christian end-times prophecy beliefs.  Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Adam Edelman Right out of the gate, both DeSantis and Ramaswamy blasted their fellow Republicans for having lost so many contests on Tuesday night. But they didn\u2019t mention their party\u2019s struggles with abortion rights \u2014 which was, perhaps, the biggest factor in Republicans losing those races. \u201cWhat we saw last night, I\u2019m sick of Republicans losing,\u201d DeSantis said. Ramaswamy called the GOP a \u201cparty of losers\u201d that got \u201ctrounced last night.\u201d Republican candidates suffered losses Tuesday night in the Virginia legislative elections and the Kentucky gubernatorial race. In those races, Democrats put abortion rights front and center. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in Ohio enshrining abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution also passed. The results were just the latest examples in a still unbroken winning streak by candidates and ballot measures supporting abortion rights in the nearly 17 months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and further highlighted Republican struggles on the issue.  Natasha Korecki Ramaswamy here is separating himself from DeSantis and Haley on Israel, saying he would concentrate on the U.S. southern border. He also hit Haley hard as he has been in the last several weeks on Israel, saying, \u201cDo you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels?\u201d Alec Hern\u00e1ndez That DeSantis anecdote about the young evacuee from Israel is a staple on the campaign trail. DeSantis has flexed his official government position to support his campaign message since the war broke out \u2014 tightening sanctions on Iran with the Florida legislature, evacuating Americans on Florida Division of Emergency Management flights and sending medical aid and supplies to Israel. Alexandra Marquez As the candidates answer questions about the Israel-Hamas war, likely Iowa caucusgoers are paying attention. In our latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, 57% of likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers said that the Israel-Hamas war is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as they evaluate candidates. Alex Tabet Ramaswamy has long spread the conspiracy theory that we\u2019re only in Ukraine because of Hunter Biden. Natasha Korecki DeSantis has been working hard the last several weeks to take action on Israel from Florida and he makes sure to get that across just now. Phil Prazan Tim Scott leans into faith and religion in his answer on moving the GOP away from Trump. According to Pew Research, 77% of adults in Texas are Christian. The largest subset of Christians is Evangelical Protestants \u2014 with 31% of the state. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Katherine Koretski Ramaswamy posted on X just now regarding his debate opening answer, calling on GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel to resign: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this Republican Establishment that has made us a party of losers. Where is the accountability for years of losing: 2018, 2020, 2022 and now last night? I\u2019m calling on @GOPChairwoman to resign tonight.\u201d Emma Barnett NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of voters at a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire. The debate watch party is being hosted by the Cheshire County Republican Committee. Jacob Favolise, 20, is a Republican from Keene, supporting Gov. Chris Christie. His immediate reaction to the first debate question: \u201cJust remember who was calling out Donald Trump before it was cool: Chris Christie\u201d Chuck Todd The best thing the first question did was separate the candidates between those who are running to be the GOP nominee and those who are running for their own personal reasons or gain. Jillian Frankel In her first response of the night, Haley mentioned needing an accountant in the White House, an appeal that might resonate especially well with Iowa Republicans, who say the economy is a top voting issue ahead of the Jan. 15 caucus, according to our most recent NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. Allan Smith and Jason Abbruzzese Ramaswamy wasn\u2019t joking about being \u201cunconstrained.\u201d He immediately picked two targets that many GOP voters love to jeer: RNC chair Ronna McDaniel and the media and decided to take his time to blast them rather than explain why he should be the nominee. It's red meat for his online supporters. Phil Prazan From an early September poll: 41% of Texas voters have a favorable view of Trump, while 51% had an unfavorable view. 79% of Republicans have a FAVORABLE view. Trump is by far the choice of Texas Republicans so far. Their views on the recent criminal charges against him have not changed that. 85% of Texas GOP voters believe the charges against Trump are \u201cmostly based on politics,\u201d as opposed to \u201cmostly based on the facts.\u201d Only 5% of Texas GOP voters don\u2019t know or are unsure. Phil Prazan is the political reporter and anchor of the public affairs show Lone Star Politics on NBC DFW/KXAS. Dasha Burns Interesting to see Ramaswamy is in a fighting mood tonight \u2014 but so far not looking to pick a fight with his opponents like he did at the first debate. In the second debate he tried on the \u201cuniter\u201d brand. Now he\u2019s trying out fighting with the moderators. Maura Barrett I am sitting in the audience with a clear view of Ronna McDaniels \u2014 when Ramaswamy called her out and offered to yield his spot on the stage to take ownership for Republican losses, she started to get out of her chair, clearly frustrated with the accusation, before she sat back down. She remains in her seat now. Garrett Haake Ramaswamy's campaign warned he would try to start trouble today: \u201cVivek speaks the truth. If he\u2019s going to make people on the debate stage uncomfortable and they\u2019re gonna get mad and maybe we\u2019ll see some mics cut off,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin told me today. \u201cBut he\u2019s ready and he\u2019s not going hold back. He\u2019s gonna be unconstrained.\u201d Alex Tabet NBC News is watching the debate with dozens of caucusgoers at a bar in Altoona, Iowa. The debate watch party is being hosted by Americans For Prosperity. Joe Pendergast, 69, was a Gov. Doug Burgum fan who\u2019s bummed he didn\u2019t make the stage tonight. \u201cI really wanted him to be able to express himself unlike the last debate where they didn\u2019t let him even talk,\u201d Pendergast said of the North Dakota governor. Since Burgum didn\u2019t qualify for the debate, Pendergast is taking a fresh look at Haley. Pendergast, who\u2019s now retired, says he\u2019s been impressed by Haley\u2019s debate performances thus far and is expecting her to come out swinging again tonight. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna take any prisoners and I think she\u2019s gonna be very aggressive tonight,\u201d predicted Pendergast. Katherine Koretski and Alex Tabet Vivek Ramaswamy goes after the Republican National Committee in his first answer. On the trail, he has said he's using the Republican Party as a \u201cvehicle\u201d to win the nomination. He has had a longstanding beef with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. ",

        "title": "GOP candidates split over raising Social Security retirement age in presidential debate",
        "content": "Five of the Republican presidential candidates were sharply divided Wednesday over whether to raise the retirement age for Social Security recipients. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said they back raising the retirement age for younger workers, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said they wouldn\u2019t change it at all. The latter two are in alignment with the position of former President Donald Trump, who didn\u2019t attend the debate. None of the candidates onstage for the NBC News Republican presidential debate suggested they would cut entitlement benefits for seniors \u2014 a position that would alienate older voters who reliably turn up at the polls during election years. Follow for live updates But Christie and Haley argued it\u2019s unrealistic to think Social Security can remain solvent without overhauling the system. Christie said he would raise the retirement age for workers who are now in their 30s and 40s. People who\u2019ve paid into the Social Security system can begin receiving benefits as early as 62 years old. \u201cI have a son who\u2019s in the audience tonight who\u2019s 30 years old. If he can\u2019t adjust to a few-year increase in Social Security retirement age over the next 40 years, I got bigger problems with him than his Social Security payments,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThe fact is we need to be realistic about this.\u201d Christie also backed the concept of a means test, in which wealthy people wouldn\u2019t receive such federal benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Warren Buffett is collecting Social Security,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if he is, shame on you; you shouldn\u2019t be taking the money.\u201d Haley suggested that the retirement age be lifted for workers now in their 20s. She also backs means testing, as well as hiking benefits based on inflation.   \u201cAny candidate that tells you that they\u2019re not going to take on entitlements is not being serious. Social Security will go bankrupt in 10 years; Medicare will go bankrupt in eight,\u201d Haley said. \u201cRight now, you have Ron and Trump joining Biden and Pelosi saying they\u2019re not going to change or do any sort of entitlement reform.\u201d Other candidates on the stage in Miami said they wouldn\u2019t touch the third rail of American politics. \u201cLet me just say to my mama and every other mama or grandfather receiving Social Security: As president of the United States, I will protect your Social Security,\u201d Scott vowed, adding that he would tackle the nation\u2019s debt by creating jobs and cutting government spending and taxes.  \u201cIf we\u2019re going to actually tame this tiger,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe way you do it is not by picking on seniors who have paid into a program that deserved their money coming back out to them. The way you deal with it is No. 1, you have to grow your economy.\u201d Pressed by NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker about whether he would raise the retirement age, Scott said: \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d DeSantis, whose state is home to millions of retirees, joked: \u201cLook, as governor of Florida, I know a few people on Social Security.\u201d \u201cMy grandmother lived till 91, and Social Security was her sole source of income, and that\u2019s true for a lot of seniors throughout this country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019d say to seniors in America: Promise made, promise kept. I understand what you\u2019re going through with the rising prices, and you need that Social Security check.\u201d He also noted that life expectancy in the U.S. has been declining in recent years (in part because of the opioid epidemic and the Covid-19 pandemic). \u201cWhen life expectancy is declining, I don\u2019t see how you could raise it the other direction,\u201d he said. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s answer was less straightforward. He didn't directly answer the question of whether he\u2019d make any changes in the retirement age. But he seemed to suggest he would be able to salvage the program by shutting down some federal agencies, making severe cuts to the federal workforce and pulling back on foreign military and economic aid that he said has been sent \"willy nilly.\" \u201cWe\u2019re working within the last window I believe we will have to actually fix this problem while still leaving Social Security and Medicare benefits for current seniors intact,\u201d Ramaswamy said.

        "title": "Grappling with Trump and abortion losses: Six key takeaways from the Republican debate",
        "content": "On his home turf at the Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sharpened his case against front-runner Donald Trump and tussled with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as she looked to build on her momentum. Five candidates met on stage Wednesday night, just over two months before voting begins: DeSantis, Haley, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Absent for the third time was Trump, the former president who is dominating the GOP polls so far \u2014 and continued his debate counterprogramming tradition with a rally in nearby Hialeah. While DeSantis and Haley are competing for second place and a shot at being the main GOP alternative to Trump, the other three are fighting to keep their candidacies alive. Here are some key takeaways from the debate. DeSantis used the first question to get right into his case against Trump before a larger audience, rattling off a litany of what he called Trump's failures as president \u2014 and blaming him for a poor election night for the GOP on Tuesday. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance,\" DeSantis said. \"He should explain why we didn\u2019t have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he racked up so much debt. He should explain why he didn\u2019t drain the swamp. And he said Republicans were gonna get tired of winning \u2014 what we saw last night, I\u2019m sick of Republicans losing.\u201d Haley, who worked in Trump's administration as ambassador to the United Nations, said Trump \"was the right president at the right time; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right president now.\u201d Christie chimed in: \u201cI\u2019ll say this about Donald Trump: Anybody who\u2019s going to be spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party or this country.\u201d Ramaswamy began throwing elbows at his first opportunity. He complained that NBC News was hosting the debate and that \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker was asking questions. He tore into Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and blamed her for the GOP getting \"trounced\" in Tuesday's elections and other elections since 2016 \u2014 conveniently leaving out that that timeline coincides with Trump's rise. Ramaswamy then knocked Haley as \u201cDick Cheney in 3-inch heels,\u201d which drew some jeers and oohs from the crowd. Haley brushed him off: \"They're 5-inch heels, and I don't wear them unless you can run in them,\" she said. She added: \"They're not a fashion statement. They're for ammunition.\" Then she moved on. Later, Ramaswamy attacked DeSantis and Haley for backing what he called \"censorship\" of student groups during a discussion about antisemitism on college campuses. And he mentioned Haley when discussing Ukraine: \"I\u2019m actually enjoying watching the Ukraine hawks quietly, elegantly tiptoe back from their position as this thing has unwound into a disaster.\" Then Ramaswamy again took unprompted aim at Haley in the second hour of the debate, noting that her daughter was on TikTok. Haley responded: \u201cLeave my daughter out of your voice.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just scum,\u201d she told him. Asked about another defeat for abortion foes in Ohio on Tuesday, DeSantis emphasized his support for \u201ca culture of life\u201d and said that different states can set their own abortion laws. He signed a ban on abortion after six weeks in Florida. \u201cAll this stuff that\u2019s happened to the pro-life cause, they have been caught flat-footed on these referenda. And they have been losing,\u201d he said, lamenting that conservatives are losing voters who support Republican candidates but also support abortion-rights measures. Scott, meanwhile, called for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks: \u201cI would challenge Nikki and Ron to join me at a 15-week limit.\u201d That's the same length as the state-level policy that Virginia Republicans campaigned on this year, but they lost both houses of the state Legislature on Tuesday. Haley said Republicans won\u2019t find the votes to \u201cban abortions\u201d at the federal level. When pressed on whether she\u2019d enact a 15-week abortion ban, she said: \u201cI would support anything that would pass.\u201d Haley, responding to one of many broadsides from Ramaswamy, said: \"I\u2019m telling you, Putin and President Xi are salivating at the thought that someone like that could become president. They would love that.\" He sought to interrupt her, but she made her case for protecting Ukraine and bolstering international partnerships, arguing that a network of foreign foes would exploit weakness creeping into the nation's commitment to its alliances. \"America can never be so arrogant to think we don\u2019t need friends after 9/11. We need a lot of friends,\" Haley said. \"This unholy alliance between Russia, Ukraine and China is real. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to support the Ukrainians; it\u2019s because they know that China\u2019s coming after them next. There is a reason Ukrainians want us to support Israelis because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins.\" Haley took multiple opportunities during the debate to promote her belief in an aggressive U.S. role in shaping global affairs. And she seemed to delight in smacking down Ramaswamy by associating him with Putin and Xi. The two highest-polling candidates on stage tussled over the biggest foreign policy concern in Washington: China. But the attacks largely pointed back to development in their own states, as opposed to disagreements over future foreign policy. Haley took aim at DeSantis when discussing her plan to confront China economically. \u201cWe will go and end all formal trade relations with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl, something Ron has yet to say that he\u2019s going to do,\u201d she said. DeSantis hit back: \u201cAmbassador Haley said somehow I wasn\u2019t doing \u2014 she welcomed them into South Carolina, and gave them land near a military base, wrote the Chinese ambassador a love letter saying what a great friend they were.\u201d He said that in Florida, \u201cI banned China from buying land in this state.\u201d Haley came back at the Florida governor: \"Yes, I brought a fiberglass company 10 years ago to South Carolina. But Ron, you are the chair of your economic development agency that as of last week said Florida is the ideal place for Chinese businesses.\" Later, Haley took aim at DeSantis from the right on environmental policy. \"He has opposed fracking, he's opposed drilling,\" Haley said. She called him \"a liberal when it comes to the environment,\" bringing up an argument she litigated at a previous debate, too. DeSantis responded: \"We are absolutely going to frack. But I disagree with Nikki Haley: I don't think it's a good idea to drill in the Florida Everglades, and I know most Floridians agree with me.\" The candidates were split on whether to cut retirement benefits going forward. Haley called for slashing long-term spending on Medicare and Social Security, calling for a higher retirement age, a slower rate of benefit growth and curtailing benefits to wealthy Americans. \u201cAny candidate that tells you that they\u2019re not going to take on entitlements is not being serious. Social Security will go bankrupt in 10 years. Medicare will go bankrupt in eight. Right now, you have Ron and Trump joining Biden and Pelosi saying they\u2019re not going to change or do any sort of entitlement reform,\" she said. DeSantis sidestepped the question by declining to endorse specific changes to Social Security or Medicare, calling for lowering inflation and boosting economic growth. He said life expectancy has declined in some recent years, so pegging benefits to that wouldn't cut them. \"To seniors in America: Promise made, promise kept,\" he said.

        "title": "Candidates clamor to be seen as closest to Israel in GOP debate",
        "content": "Republican presidential candidates competed with one another to show the most support for Israel, draw the hardest line on Iran and speak out the most aggressively about antisemitism at Wednesday's GOP presidential debate, while downplaying what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called \u201cso-called Islamophobia.\u201d All five candidates at the NBC News debate in Miami said they fully supported Israel\u2019s military campaign against Hamas and would not do anything to rein in its bombing of Gaza, which has led to a worsening humanitarian crisis for Palestinian civilians. \u201cI would tell Bibi, finish the job once and for all with these butchers,\u201d DeSantis said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his nickname.  \u201cFinish them. Finish them,\u201d former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said of Hamas. \u201cSupport Israel with whatever they need, whenever they need it. ... The last thing we need to do is tell Israel what to do.\u201d \u201cWipe Hamas off the map,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. \u201cDiplomacy only is a weak strategy. ... You cannot negotiate with evil. You have to destroy it.\u201d  \u201cAmerica is here, no matter what it is you need,\u201d former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he would tell Netanyahu. \u201cI would go one step further. I would tell Bibi that Israel has the right and responsibility to protect itself,\u201d said businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Follow live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war here. None of the candidates spoke about the plight of Palestinian civilians caught in the war between Israel and Hamas. Nor did any rule out putting U.S. troops on the ground in the Middle East if the conflict escalates.  DeSantis criticized the media and others for \u201ccomplaining\u201d when \u201cIsrael is simply trying to defend themselves,\u201d a reference to coverage of the thousands killed and injured in Israeli bombings in Gaza. Ramaswamy was the only candidate to stake out a somewhat heterodox position on Israel, saying he wants to eventually taper off U.S. support for the nation. But he did not take the opportunity to detail that proposal, instead using a question on Israel to swipe at Haley and DeSantis for, he claimed, wearing high heels on stage. In the latest NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, 57% of likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers said the Israel-Hamas war is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as they evaluate candidates.  The candidates also issued stark warnings to Iran, amid fears of the conflict spiraling into a larger regional war. Iran has supported anti-Israel militant movements in the region.  DeSantis, who served in Iraq as a Navy lawyer, said that if the U.S. puts troops on the ground, it must be prepared to \u201cdefend them with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d \u201cI would say, if you harm one hair on the head of an American servicemember, you will have hell to pay,\u201d he said. Haley criticized President Joe Biden for \u201ctit for tat\u201d responses to Iran-backed militant groups that have fired rockets and launched drones against U.S. troops based in Syria and elsewhere in the region, saying she would favor a more robust response to groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.  \u201cWe should be going in and taking out their infrastructure so they never do it again,\u201d Haley said.  On the home front, all the candidates said they would be more aggressive in combating antisemitism. Several candidates vowed to deport foreign students who espouse views they see as pro-Hamas. And they threatened to cut any federal funding to universities that they said are tolerating antisemitism. \u201cLet me just say to every single university president in America, federal funding is a privilege not a right,\u201d Scott said. \u201cTo all the students on visas who are encouraging Jewish genocide, I would deport you.\" DeSantis bragged about eliminating a pro-Palestinian student group on the campus of a Florida state university. And he criticized Biden for trying to tamp down on \u201cso-called Islamophobia,\u201d suggesting harassment of Muslims is not a real issue. Ramaswamy, again, broke away from the field on this question, accusing his opponents of being \u201cpro-censorship\u201d for wanting to disband student groups and deport students over their political beliefs.  \u201cWe don\u2019t quash this with censorship, because that creates a worse underbelly. We quell it through leadership by calling it out,\u201d Ramaswamy said.  The only candidate who addressed the issue of Islamophobia was Christie, who served as a U.S. attorney in New Jersey in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  \u201cI personally went from mosque to mosque in New Jersey and met with the leaders of those mosques and their members. ... And we developed fabulous relationships with Muslim Americans,\u201d Christie said.  \u201cYou must work with both sides.\u201d Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior politics reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "An Adam McKay-backed series is streaming only on social media. Will it pick up an audience?",
        "content": "A short-form series backed by the Oscar-winning director Adam McKay's nonprofit production studio launched on social media this week, in one of the first major efforts from a traditional Hollywood producer to bring a scripted show to TikTok and other social platforms first. Yellow Dot Studios' \"Cobell Energy,\" a satirical comedy that follows a family-owned oil company, premiered Tuesday on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. It is also expected to debut on Snap in the future, the platform confirmed to NBC News. The fake company even has its own website. The show was shot and edited entirely vertically. Its humor and mockumentary format make the show a mix of \u201cSuccession\u201d meets \u201cThe Office\" \u2014 but in bite-size episodes that vary in length, and can be anywhere from one minute to four minutes. But even with a smart premise and support from one of Hollywood's biggest names, \u201cCobell Energy\" hasn't garnered many eyeballs just yet. As of Friday, its pilot had amassed just over 12,000 views on TikTok, where it has about 300 followers; about 560 \"likes\" on Instagram, where the show has more than 800 followers; and over 300 views on YouTube, where the channel has less than 100 subscribers. The early lack of traction has underscored that it's not easy to court younger, social media-savvy viewers with short-form content intended to be watched on smartphones. Several past attempts have either not had mainstream success or have been entirely unsuccessful, like Quibi, the short-form video streaming service from Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman that abruptly shut down six months after its launch in 2020. It's more \"cost intensive\" to produce a traditional television show for social media, according to Irving Belateche, a professor of the practice of cinematic arts at the University of Southern California. \u201cWhat is their return?\" he said, referring to the creatives making the content. \"Because like Quibi, you know, they put a lot of money in it and it didn\u2019t get the money back.\u201d With the rise of mobile use, many have turned to TikTok to consume content. TikTok users have popularized uploading full movies to the short-form video platform by splicing them up several minutes at a time.  Shows like \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy, \u201c911,\u201d \u201cChicago Med\u201d and movies like \u201cMaid\u201d and \u201cThe Fall\u201d have become mainstays for anonymous \u201cmovie accounts,\" which rack up thousands \u2014 and sometimes millions \u2014 of views. While these accounts are unsanctioned and don\u2019t have permission to share the content, they\u2019re incredibly popular on TikTok, and some studios and streaming services have gotten on board with the trend. Earlier this year Paramount Pictures shared the entirety of its 2004 film \u201cMean Girls\u201d in bite-sized pieces on TikTok. A spokesperson for Yellow Dot Studios did not respond to a request for comment. Ari Cagan, who serves as a co-writer, director and producer for \"Cobell Energy,\" told WIRED that the show is trying to cater to a TikTok audience by cutting through tradition film and television storytelling devices like establishing shots. The idea, he said, is to get viewers right into the story without all the preamble of traditional television. \u201cGiven that everything is coming to you in this stream, and it is so disposable, it\u2019s really easy to get into the habit of thinking that you can just make something that doesn\u2019t look very good or doesn\u2019t sound very good,\" Cagan, who worked on unscripted shows for TikTok, including the popular \u201cKeep the Meter Running\u201d series, told the publication. The show's marketing also won't rely on traditional advertising. It will instead lean into the whims of social media algorithms, Cagan said. For McKay, who has been a trailblazer in the digital space with platforms like Funny or Die, producing content that marries comedy with socially conscious messaging has been a priority. His 2021 Oscar-nominated film \"Don't Look Up\" was a satirical parable for climate change. With Yellow Dot Studios, which launched in May, McKay hopes to produce other forms of content with messages about issues like climate change front and center, according to Variety. Both Cagan and McKay told GQ that they hope Gen-Z audiences will gravitate toward the comedy and environmental messaging behind \u201cCobell Energy.\" When discussing traditional Hollywood\u2019s attempt to produce content on social media, Belateche, the USC professor, said it can be hit or miss. As Hollywood taps more into social media, it often looks to content creators for how they can best succeed. \u201cI think that Hollywood is moving in that direction,\u201d Belateche said, referring to content for social media. \u201cBut right now it\u2019s dominated by non-Hollywood players. They\u2019re much more, what we call \u2018content creators,\u2019 though some people don\u2019t like that term.\u201d Belateche said he found the show to be very traditional in its production, making it similar to traditional television shows shared by the accounts that post film and TV show clips. \"As a film professor, I'm objective and just judging the clip, I thought it was pretty well done,\" he said. \"And I thought it was entertaining.\" Though he said it was surprising to him that the clip he watched didn't end on a cliffhanger, a storytelling tool that could help bring an audience back for the next installment.

        "content": "It was a big night for female artists at the 24th Latin Grammys ceremony \u2014 the first held outside the U.S. \u201cBienvenidos a Espa\u00f1a, bienvenidos a Sevilla!\u201d actor and presenter Antonio Banderas said in his opening speech, as he welcomed the audience to Spain. Shakira, who took home awards for song of the year, best urban/fusion performance and best pop song for her collaborations with Argentinian DJ and record producer Bizarrap and fellow Colombian Karol G \u2014 incorporated her two young sons into her first performance of \u201cAcr\u00f3stico.\u201d The Colombian superstar later returned to the stage for a medley of her hits including \u201cShakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\u201d accompanied by her signature dance moves. \u201cI want to dedicate this award to my sons ... because I promised them that I would be happy,\u201d Shakira said while accepting the award for song of the year. Karol G won two coveted awards: best album of the year and best urban music album for \u201cMa\u00f1ana ser\u00e1 bonito.\u201d Mexican singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade took home record of the year for \"De Todas Las Flores.\" Viewers were watching closely for the top four categories: record of the year, album of the year, song of the year and best new artist. Nominees in those categories included Shakira, Peso Pluma, GALE, Maluma and Alejandro Sanz, who performed at the event. Other nominees in those top categories included Christina Aguilera, Bad Bunny, Natalia Lafourcade, Karol G, Juanes, Carlos Vives and Marc Anthony. The person with the most nominations this year was producer \u00c9dgar Barrera, who received 13 nominations and won for composer of the year, producer of the year and best regional Mexican song for \u201cun X100to,\u201d a collaboration with Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny and the Mexican American Grupo Frontera. The Latin Recording Academy also honored Laura Pausini with the Person of the Year award, which was presented by Karol G. Pausini, a multilingual Italian artist who has performed extensively in Spanish, won a Grammy for best Latin pop album in 2006 and a Golden Globe in 2021, and she has been nominated for an Academy Award. \"I'm the most Latina Italian in the entire damn world,\" Pausini joked during her acceptance speech. Nominees and presenters from Spain made displays of their country\u2019s heritage a central point of the show, broadcast from across the Atlantic for the first time. Rosal\u00eda opened the show with a haunting cover, \u201cSe Nos Rompi\u00f3 El Amor,\u201d by the late Spanish icon Roc\u00edo Jurado. Banderas gave a speech honoring Spanish artists across genres, including Pablo Picasso, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and flamenco guitarist Paco de Luc\u00eda. Alejandro Sanz later filled the stage with dozens of flamenco dancers as he sang his 1997 hit \u201cCoraz\u00f3n Part\u00edo.\u201d Below is a partial list of winners and nominees.

        "title": "Fans of 'Blue Beetle' Latino superhero root for its streaming success",
        "content": "Blue Beetle, DC\u2019s first live-action film with a Latino lead, is making its streaming debut Friday on Max. Fans who identified with the Latino superhero hope the movie gets many more viewers \u2014 which didn\u2019t happen at the box office, much to their frustration. \u201cThe jokes were so good because they were so relatable, to be honest, because it reminded me of stuff my uncles would say,\u201d said Daniel Espinoza, 24, of Inglewood, California. \u201cThe movie showed how much family plays into the Latino culture.\u201d Numerous moments in the movie caught young Latino viewers\u2019 attention, from comedian George Lopez\u2019s role as Jaime Reyes\u2019/Blue Beetle\u2019s t\u00edo, or uncle, Rudy, to the reggaeton soundtrack of Calle 13\u2019s \u201cAtreve-te-te\u201d and the old-school songs of the late Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, which are a familiar musical backdrop in many Latino households. \u201cBlue Beetle was truly a love letter to Latinos everywhere,\u201d said Melissa Ignacio, 28, of Santa Clarita, California. \u201cThe fact that they had songs from Selena, who I listen to, and songs from Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, who my dad listens to, made it such an enjoyable experience \u2014 my parents and I were all able to enjoy equally.\" Latino actor Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, who's of Mexican, Cuban and Ecuadorian heritage, was widely praised for his performance, and the movie earned a 92% audience score and a 78% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. Still, it made headlines as DC\u2019s lowest-grossing film. Critics say numerous factors came into play when the movie hit theaters in August: The Hollywood writers and actors strikes meant the actors weren\u2019t promoting the film, and the Blue Beetle character wasn\u2019t a common face in the DC Extended Universe. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see Blue Beetle, the first brown superhero, from a major studio like DC,\u201d said Jack Rico, a ShowBizCafe.com journalist. \u201cBut to really reach mainstream status, we need to defy those metrics.\u201d According to Comscore/Screen Engine\u2019s PostTrak, Latinos made up almost 4 in 10 (38%) of the box office turnout. \u201cI felt hopeful, and I felt seen,\u201d said Marina Sangit, 27, a second-generation Mexican and Indian American living in Washington, D.C. \u201cI think we\u2019ve come a long way, but I felt seen and visible in a way that was deeply meaningful and impactful to my life and my lived experiences.\u201d The movie\u2019s low box office numbers disappointed Latinos who have mourned the demise of other movies and television shows with Latino leads and storylines, such as Netflix\u2019s \u201cGentefied\u201d and the reboot of \u201cOne Day at a Time.\" Both shows were well-reviewed and had loyal fans, but they were canceled when they didn\u2019t get the viewership and metrics of other trending productions. \u201cWatching that happen over and over again makes me feel like our stories are not appreciated or unimportant,\" said Alejandra V\u00e1zquez Baur, 28, who lives in New York City. \u201cBlue Beetle\u201d brought families together, which V\u00e1zquez Baur experienced when she went home to New Mexico. \u201cMe and my brothers went together, and I intentionally wanted to see it with them, who grew up playing with all of the superheroes,\" she said. In addition, \"Blue Beetle\" depicted a relatable family dynamic. \u201cIn most films, they have an aunt or an uncle or parents, a single parent, and the structure of those superhero stories or their families is pretty small,\u201d V\u00e1zquez Baur said. \u201cIn this film, specifically, we have a large family unit, multigenerational, that our main character returns to every day and feels a sense of duty across generations.\u201d Some more serious moments in the movie, such as when Jaime Reyes\u2019 family is raided by Kord Industries, resonated for some viewers as a metaphor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in immigrant communities.  \u201cAt that moment, I felt that fear growing up undocumented, thinking that one day I might be torn apart from the embrace of my family\u2019s arms,\u201d said Juan Diego Mazuera Arias, 25, of New York. \u201cSeeing Xolo\u2019s character fight as hard as he could to save his family from the heavily armed militia is a scene that will stay for me forever.\u201d \u201cBlue Beetle\u201d follows other recent movies with Latino leads, including \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cCoco.\u201d But those movies have been few and far between, as a recent University of Southern California study points out. Just 4.4% of lead roles of all ages were played by Latinos among top-grossing films from 2007 to 2022. \u201cHopefully one day in the future, we won\u2019t talk about Latino representation,\u201d Rico said, but instead more Latino and other lead roles are seen as \"representation for everyone.\" In the meantime, \"Blue Beetle\" fans hope the movie gains traction on Max. \u201cI will tell all my friends and all my cousins,\u201d V\u00e1zquez Baur said. \u201cI hope more people see \u2018Blue Beetle\u2019 as it pops up at the top of their Max profile.\u201d For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

        "title": "Brazil's Christ the Redeemer statue welcomes Taylor Swift with unique display",
        "content": "Taylor Swift received a special welcome in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday night with a projection on the city's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue as she continues the Latin American leg of her Eras Tour in Brazil. A shirt with the words \"Welcome to Brasil\" was displayed on the statue, along with the names of Brazil's states. The projection also featured symbols of Swift's music, including a scarf (a nod to her hit song \"All Too Well\") and a bow and arrow (most likely referring to \"The Archer\"). The shirt's design resembled that of one Swift wore in the music video for her song \"You Belong With Me.\" Mayor Eduardo Paes confirmed that a projection would be displayed on the statue Thursday \u2014 and compared the impact of the singer-songwriter's arrival to the likes of singers Michael Jackson and Madonna. \"We will properly honor Taylor Swift and her arrival to carioca territory tonight,\" he said in a video posted on X, using a term that refers to the people of Rio de Janeiro. \"Welcome, Taylor Swift.\" Swift is scheduled to play three shows at the city\u2019s Nilton Santos stadium starting Friday, followed by three more shows in S\u00e3o Paulo next weekend. The mayor's announcement comes after an online movement from fans who pleaded for Omar Raposo, rector of the sanctuary of Christ the Redeemer, to project a shirt from one of Swift's music videos onto the statue upon her arrival, according to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. Raposo agreed, but only if Swifties managed to donate 20,000 units of panettone, a sweet bread eaten at Christmas, and clean water as part of a fundraiser to support local charities for the Holy See's World Day of the Poor, O Globo reported. Christ the Redeemer frequently projects messages or visuals in support of social and cultural causes. In July, the statue displayed a clock symbolizing the urgent state of the climate crisis. And in 2020, an array of flags of countries impacted by the coronavirus pandemic was displayed. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

        "title": "Travis Kelce's old tweets are resurfacing online, and some Swifties are here for it",
        "content": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's viral public relationship has captivated the internet. Now, so have some of Kelce\u2019s old tweets. On Wednesday, several of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's social media posts dating to 2010 recirculated on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), where many of Swift's fans appeared genuinely amused. Many online appeared enthralled by Kelce's early internet humor and spelling errors. Some of his old musings became memes. Among the many viral re-shares was a 2011 post in which Kelce observed a squirrel\u2019s behavior after having given it a piece of bread. He spelled both \u201csquirrel\u201d and \u201cpiece\u201d incorrectly.  \u201cI just gave a squirle a peice of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy,\u201d he said in the tweet. A Taylor Swift fan account juxtaposed Kelce\u2019s 2011 commentary with Swift\u2019s lyrics from the extended re-recording of her 2012 song \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d \u201ctaylor swift in 2011: from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i\u2019m a soldier who\u2019s returning half her weight, and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? just between us, did the love affair maim you too? travis kelce in 2011: i just gave a squirle a peice of bread,\u201d the post on X said. Others appeared most amused by Kelce's tweets about Chipotle, or, as he called it for many months in 2010, \u201c#Chipolte.\u201d \u201ci\u2019m fr i\u2019m tears over his commitment to this spelling,\u201d a user posted on X with an accompanying screenshot of Kelce\u2019s enthusiastic tweets about \u201cChipolte.\u201d Another old tweet appeared to foreshadow Kelce\u2019s propensity to make his dreams a reality. Before he and Swift were romantically linked, Kelce was a fan with a friendship bracelet and a dream.  \u201cThe moon looks crazy tonight... Imma chill out here for a little and just visualize my success n vibe to the scenary,\u201d one of his old tweets said. Some brands, like Olive Garden, Taco Bell and Chipotle, have leaned in to using some of Kelce's tweets that mentioned them as part of their own promotional efforts. The official Taco Bell account on X reposted a 2009 tweet where Kelce shared his plans to go to the fast food chain. \u201ckarma is a crunchwrap coming straight home to me,\u201d Taco Bell said in the post, referencing the lyrics to a Taylor Swift song and a popular item on their menu. Some fans marveled at what appears to be a lack of \"problematic\" tweets.  \u201cSwifties looking at Travis\u2019s old tweets to find something problematic but all they are finding is that this man loves chipotle, can\u2019t spell, and has no thoughts just vibes. A king.,\u201d a user posted on X. However, some Reddit sleuths started a thread about what appears to be a screenshot of a 2010 tweet from Kelce\u2019s account. The screenshot of the alleged tweet read: \u201cAs a man, You have something wrong with you if your going for girls that weigh more then you!!\u201d The post wasn't on X as of Wednesday afternoon. Those who commented on Reddit had mixed reactions, with some saying it's unsurprising and others suggesting he has most likely changed in the last decade. Users on X pointed out that some of Kelce's other tweets appear to no longer be online since they resurfaced, including a 2010 post that read, \"happy easter to all!!! #shoutout to Jesus for takin one for the team.... haha.\" A representative for Kelce didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the Reddit thread and the overall reaction to his tweets.

        "title": "FTC warns influencers over 'inadequate' disclosures of artificial sweetener promotions",
        "content": "A dozen social media influencers and two trade associations received warnings from the Federal Trade Commission on Monday for endorsing the safety of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, or for promoting the consumption of products containing sugar. By using health and diet creators, many of whom have large platforms on Instagram and TikTok, to market these products without adequately disclosing their connection to the advertiser, the American Beverage Association and the Canadian Sugar Institute may have violated FTC rules, according to warning letters the commission sent the two groups. \u201cConsumers should be able to notice the disclosure easily, and not have to look for it,\u201d said the letters, which the FTC shared in a news release. That means that in a promotional TikTok video or Instagram reel, the disclosure should be made audible in the video itself as well as visible in the text description. The rule applies to paid sponsorships, promotions in exchange for free products, and in cases of any business or familial relationships. None of the posts targeted by the FTC included any disclosures in the videos themselves, with some creators failing entirely to indicate their material connection to the beverage association anywhere in the post. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for any trade group to hire influencers to tout its members\u2019 products and fail to ensure that the influencers come clean about that relationship,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly true for health and safety claims about sugar and aspartame, especially when made by registered dieticians and others upon whom people rely for advice about what to eat and drink.\u201d Some in-text disclosures labeling a post as \u201c#sponsored\u201d or an \u201c#ad\u201d buried those hashtags multiple lines down in the post description, the letters stated, making them insufficiently clear to the average scroller \u2014 especially because users must click to open the full post when they have lengthier descriptions. Using the in-app \u201cPaid partnership\u201d disclosure labels is also not enough when used alone, according to the FTC, because viewers may too easily miss them. The FTC\u2019s warnings fall in line with its recently revised advertising guides, published in June, addressing \u201cdeceptive\u201d reviews and endorsements. In its letters involving the beverage association, the FTC laid out concerns about TikTok and Instagram posts by influencers \u2014 some who are dietitians \u2014 who have built followings online in large part for giving health advice.  Those listed in the letter include: Valerie Agyeman, Nichole Andrews, Leslie Bonci, Keri Gans, Stephanie Grasso, Cara Harbstreet, Andrea Miller, Idrees Mughal, Adam Pecoraro and Mary Ellen Phipps. The FTC said it also examined Instagram videos by Jenn Messina and Lindsay Pleskot in its research into CSI. The influencers each have followings that range from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand followers. Two of them \u2014 Grasso and Mughal \u2014 have more than 1 million each.  Harbstreet, a dietitian with about 38,500 TikTok followers, wrote in a statement to NBC News that she shares the FTC\u2019s goal of transparent disclosure and protecting audiences from disinformation, and that she plans to ensure her compliance with its updated guidelines. \u201cConflicts of interest are not something I take lightly and I have stringent standards in place to determine which partners I work with. One of those many considerations is the quality of the science,\u201d Harbstreet wrote. \u201cIn this case, I stand behind what the evidence currently indicates regarding the safety of aspartame. This is supported by numerous domestic and international health organizations and food safety review committees.\u201d NBC News has reached out to the other influencers who were named in the letter for comment. They did not immediately respond Wednesday. The Canadian Sugar Institute did not immediately respond with a comment Wednesday. A spokesperson for the American Beverage Association wrote in an email statement that the association appreciates the FTC\u2019s guidance and will continue its \u201congoing commitment\u201d to disclose its relationships with dietitians. \u201cWe took proactive, prudent and meticulous steps to be transparent about our partnership with credible experts who spoke to the science behind the safety of aspartame and the FDA\u2019s determination that it is safe,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cImportantly, no question has been raised about the substance of these posts.\u201d Both the trade associations, as well as each of the influencers involved, are facing possible civil penalties of up to $50,120 per violation. Each recipient has 15 working days to tell FTC what they have done or will do to address the agency\u2019s concerns, according to the letters.

Kimmel will now sit alongside other four-peaters wuch as Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Lemmon. The only people to host more times are Johnny Carson (5), Billy Crystal (9) and Bob Hope (11).

        "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow ski trial musical to debut in London",
        "content": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2018s legal battle with a skiing optometrist is getting the musical treatment. \u201cGwyneth Goes Skiing\u201d is set to debut in London this December from self-described \u201charbingers of queer chaos\u201d Awkward Productions. Linus Karp will star as Paltrow while Terry Sanderson, the optometrist who collided with her on a Utah ski slope in 2016, is played by Joseph Martin. The show also features original musical by singer and songwriter Leland (\u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d). \u201cGwyneth Goes Skiing\u201d is based on the court trial between Paltrow and Sanderson that took place earlier this year. Sanderson filed suit against the \u201cSliding Doors\u201d star after their collision, claiming he was left with a concussion, four broken ribs and a brain injury. He originally sought $3.1 million in compensation. Paltrow, who said Sanderson was the one who had skied into her, counter-sued for $1 and attorney fees. The televised two-week trial became a viral hit and saw clips from Paltrow\u2019s testimony turn into memes, including the moment after the crash when she screamed at Sanderson: \u201cYou skied directly into my effing back!\u201d A jury ultimately found in Paltrow\u2019s favor. \u201cShe\u2019s the Goop-founding, Door-Sliding, Shakespeare-In-Loving, consciously-uncoupling Hollywood superstar. He\u2019s a retired Optometrist from Utah. In 2016, they went skiing,\u201d reads the logline for \u201cGwyneth Goes Skiing.\u201d \u201cOn the slopes of Deer Valley, their worlds collided, and so did they \u2014 literally. Ouch. Seven years later in 2023, they went to court. Double ouch. This is their story. Kind of. Not really. But also, it\u2019s at Christmas.\u201d The show at London\u2019s Pleasance Theatre, which runs for 10 days from Dec. 13, will see audience members participate as the jury.

        "title": "How Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are inspiring people to raise their dating standards",
        "content": "It\u2019s a love story that people just want to say yes to: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 who have been rumored to be dating since September \u2014 are inspiring people to step up their own dating expectations.   While no one knows what their very viral and public relationship is like behind closed doors, many fans \u2014 who have parasocial relationships with Swift \u2014 are rooting for her happiness. Kelce, it seems, is the fairy tale match they hoped she would find.  He\u2019s on the sidelines of her Eras Tour show with Swift\u2019s dad, singing along to \u201cBlank Space\u201d and grinning when Swift changes the lyrics to \u201cKarma\u201d to refer to him. He catches her in his arms when she runs to give him a kiss at her show. He praises her on his podcast. Even before the two were romantically linked, Kelce was a fan with a friendship bracelet and a dream.  Seeing how Kelce has publicly supported and praised Swift has elevated many people\u2019s own expectations for what they seek in romantic partnerships. Some online say they are making changes in how they approach dating. \u201cI definitely was dating the worst of the worst of the worst of men, and I thought it was normal. I was begging for phone calls, for just any form of communication,\u201d said Martha Mary Santos, 26, of Mandeville, Louisiana, who made a TikTok video reacting to Swift and Kelce. \u201cWhen I saw the way Travis treats Taylor, it was a massive wake-up call for me.\u201d Lisa Carr, 32, a TikTok commentator on women\u2019s culture and pop culture, noted the parallels between the popularity of Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship and this moment in culture. Music charts are dominated by women; the Greta Gerwig-directed \u201cBarbie\u201d movie became a box office phenomenon; Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance tour broke records, she said. \u201cThere is an insane amount of sociological and cultural factors that are captured at this intersection of Travis and Taylor right now,\u201d Carr said in a TikTok video that went viral. \u201cWhat are we kind of saying no to, and yes to, as a society? This has been a loud and resounding yes.\u201d  \u201cThe women are winning loudly, and the men have been real quiet,\u201d she added.       In an interview, Carr, who is from Tacoma, Washington, elaborated on Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship. She said their public support of each other \u2014 whether at a football game or on a concert tour \u2014 exemplifies a key facet of healthy relationships: being each other\u2019s biggest cheerleader.  Kelce seems to appreciate Swift for exactly who she is, Carr said. Instead of trying to woo her solely with grand but generic gestures, he leans into simple behaviors meant to make his partner feel seen: making her a friendship bracelet, speaking highly of her on his podcast, holding up a \u201cWe Will Stay\u201d sign during her performance of \u201cThe Archer.\u201d \u201cI know a lot of people are like, \u2018Oh, wait till they break up.\u2019 And so what? I actually wish every single one of her ex-boyfriends was like this,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe shame these sort of expressions of love, of gentleness, of commitment. We underappreciate them in our society. So I just hope that people can really start to expect that from other people.\u201d For Santos, what stands out about Kelce is that he isn\u2019t feigning detachment to appear cool to other men, nor is he threatened by Swift\u2019s overwhelming success. Instead, he seems openly lovestruck for millions to see.  Having recently left a two-year relationship, Santos said watching Swift and Kelce\u2019s romance unfold has extinguished any doubts about whether her breakup was for the best. Now, she said, she has seen the kind of love story that\u2019s possible. Los Angeles resident Emily Hamocon, 28, also ended a relationship about five months ago. Hamocon, who posts self-love advice on TikTok, said she and many others in the dating pool are tired of being treated as if they are unworthy of being loved out loud. Kelce \u201cis not afraid to show his emotions, to show his love,\u201d said Hamocon, who also shared her thoughts in a TikTok video. \u201cThat takes a lot of courage, especially since he knows there\u2019s millions and millions of people watching the relationship and he still chooses to show that sensitive side of him, which means he\u2019s definitely very secure in his masculinity.\u201d Raghav Kalra, 23, who is from New York City, said observing Swift and Kelce\u2019s dynamic has raised his own barometer for finding a partner.  \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about the fact that someone is proud to be dating you,\u201d said Kalra, a self-proclaimed Swiftie. \u201cI think what a lot of people like about this relationship, and what they\u2019re looking up to and also expecting going forward, is to just not settle for less.\u201d Atlanta resident Jess Rose, 36, said Kelce is \u201cthe personification of: \u2018If he wanted to, he would,\u2019\u201d a sentiment many online have echoed. The phrase has become a popular piece of dating advice in recent years. Though some criticize it as oversimplifying dating \u2014 not everyone can fly 11,000 miles round-trip to spend a weekend with their partners \u2014 many say the point is that someone who cares will put in the effort to show it. For Rose, watching Kelce demonstrate his commitment reminds her of the green flags she had noticed in her now-husband, who would regularly drive three hours round-trip simply to have lunch with her. (She calls it \u201clove math,\u201d an iteration of terms such as \u201cgirl math\u201d and \u201cboy math,\u201d jokes that trended this year to delineate the whimsical logic behind people\u2019s decisions.) I hope this is giving women that permission to not lower their standards to be with a successful equal man. -JESS ROSE, TIKTOKER \u201cTaylor being with a guy like Travis, who seems to check not only the success bucket, but good to his family, good to his community, confident in his own right, really wanting to be an equal,\u201d said Rose, who also made a TikTok video about the topic, \u201cI hope this is giving women that permission to not lower their standards to be with a successful equal man.\u201d She said much of the dominant narrative in pop culture has taught women that if they date a successful man, they should accept the relationship as it comes \u2014 even if that means diminishing their own needs to accommodate those of their male partner. \u201cI have a young daughter, and I like that she can look to our marriage,\u201d Rose said, \u201cbut I also like that this is giving her a relationship in such a public eye of a man who\u2019s really honoring his equal partner and not asking her to change who she is or dim her light for him.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said he may have had \"a little bit of a clue\" that Taylor Swift would swap out the lyrics in her song \"Karma\" to reference their budding romance. The change in lyrics \u2014 as well as Kelce's excitement over it \u2014 took social media by storm Saturday night. During her performance at Buenos Aires\u2019 Estadio River Plate, Swift sang \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me\" \u2014 in place of \"Karma is the guy on the screen, coming straight home to me.\" The stadium immediately erupted in screams and cheers. Cellphone video posted on social media showed Kelce, 34, grabbing his face and breaking into a big grin as he danced to the song. Swift's father happily clapped his hands. Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce addressed the moment on an episode of their \"New Heights\" podcast. \"Yeah, no, had no clue,\" Kelce said when his brother asked him how it felt to be \"the guy on the Chiefs.\" \"Well, I might have had a little bit of a clue but definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth, still shocked me. I was like, \u2018oh, shh, she really just said that, alright,'\" he said. The Chiefs tight end went on to praise Swift. \"Taylor absolutely ripped it, she killed it,\" he said. \"And it looked like she was having some fun up there.\" Following the show, Swift shocked fans again when she was seen on camera running into Kelce's arms and kissing him as they walked backstage. Kelce and Swift have not directly confirmed their relationship but have been spotted together, and Swift has attended multiple Chiefs games.

I love you so much.\u201d The throwing of objects at live music events has become a disturbing trend in recent months. In June, Bebe Rexha was hit in the face by a concertgoer\u2019s phone, which led to a man being arrested and charged with assault. That same month, pop singer Ava Max was slapped by an audience member. Max later wrote on X, \u201cHe slapped me so hard that he scratched the inside of my eye.\u201d Country artist Kelsea Ballerini was also hit by a thrown object at a show, prompting her to say: \u201cIf anyone\u2019s pushing too much or you just have that gut feeling, just always flag it. Don\u2019t throw things. You know?\u201d Swift just kicked off the South American leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour in Argentina this week, where she played three shows. Sunday night\u2019s concert was originally set to take place on Friday, but was delayed due to inclement weather. During her Saturday show, Swift seemingly confirmed her rumored romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who flew to Argentina to support her.

In a video he posted on social media, the longtime \"Access Hollywood\" co-host noticed he was trending. When Lopez investigated why, he learned some people were shocked to find out he was of Mexican descent when they saw him on videos discussing his favorite dishes, using slang of the raza, or culture. Lopez found it all pretty hilarious. \"People don't think I'm Mexican. Is that a trip? With a name like Mario Lopez?\" he said in a response video. \"They've been thinking I'm everything from Italian to Hawaiian,\" he said with a smile. He tried to offer an explainer and show the side of himself that many don't see on his shows. \"I think it's because I've been doing these food videos with my homies and it's a lot of Mexican food, a lot of mariscos. ... I'm saying 'foo,' 'homes' and a lot of slang and just kind of being yourself and I can't be like that on 'Access Hollywood' or my radio show. I'm trying to cash these checks. I can't be all hood like that.\" Lopez was born in a California border town, Chula Vista, and is a child of Mexican immigrants. While some accused him of whitewashing himself, others suggested he has only begun emphasizing his cultural heritage. But there have been a lot of clues to his heritage and times when he wove it into his professional life. Lopez broke through in Hollywood with his role as Slater in the TV series \"Saved By the Bell\" and \"Saved By the Bell: The College Years.\" In the later television series, a full episode was dedicated to Slater's Mexican American heritage and his learning that his father's last name was Sanchez and that his father hid it to get into a military academy. Two years ago, he delved into Latino representation, his culture and his own struggles because of his heritage in Peacock's \"True Colors.\" But if fans really want to be shocked they should consider this: Lopez turned 50 last month!

        "content": "The Plastics are back in a new trailer for the upcoming \"Mean Girls\" movie musical \u2014 but not everyone thinks their return looks \"fetch.\" The official X account for the movie posted the trailer Wednesday morning. The film is based on the Broadway musical adapted from the original \"Mean Girls\" movie released in 2004. It stars Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Auli\u2019i Cravalho as Janis I\u2019mi\u2019ike and Rene\u00e9 Rapp as Regina George. Rapp also played George during the musical's Broadway run. Although the movie is a musical, the songs were noticeably absent from the trailer. Fans wondered why the trailer was soundtracked by Olivia Rodrigo's \"get him back!\" Some also felt that the trailer was hiding the fact that the new \"Mean Girls\" is a musical adaptation. \"uhhh, why does this trailer hide the fact that it\u2019s a MUSICAL? why am I only hearing Olivia Rodrigo???\" one person posted on X. \"So true Mean Girls Musical, 'Get Him Back' by Olivia Rodrigo is a banger. Wait, don\u2019t you have songs? Why aren\u2019t you emphasizing your songs? You\u2019re a musical, right?\" another posted. Some had suggestions for \"Mean Girls\" songs that could have been used instead, including \"Meet the Plastics\" and \"World Burn.\" While the official trailer lacked original music, a teaser for the film that played ahead of some screenings of Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" movie briefly featured Rapp singing \"Meet the Plastics.\" Some millennials, many of whom were teens at the time of the original movie's release, recoiled at a line in the trailer that said, \"This isn't your mother's 'Mean Girls.'\" \"The Mean Girls musical trailer did not have to come for us this hard,\" one person wrote on X. \"lol how old do they think we were when we saw mean girls,\" another wrote. \"As a 30 something millennial, this was triggering\u2026\" one person posted on X. Still, some fans had high hopes for the movie, which comes out Jan. 12, 2024. Many expressed excitement over Rapp's revival of the George character. \"i can\u2019t wait for people that never watched the musical to hear renee rap sing 'world burn' for the first time,\" one person posted. \"i love mean girls i love mean girls i am SOOO EXCITED,\" another wrote. CORRECTION (Nov. 8, 2023, 5:05 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the last name of the character Janis. In the upcoming movie, it is I\u2019mi\u2019ike, not Ian.

        "content": "Timbaland apologized on Tuesday after a video surfaced of a joke he made during a live interview last month in which he said Justin Timberlake should have silenced Britney Spears with a \u201cmuzzle.\u201d The video, which went viral after it was posted by the celebrity news aggregator account Pop Base, was captured at an Oct. 29 event at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., titled \u201cSound Architects: A Producer Conversation with Timbaland.\u201d In the clip, a person addressing Timbaland is heard saying Timberlake\u2019s single \u201cCry Me a River\u201d \u2014 which Timbaland co-wrote and co-produced \u2014 reappeared in headlines after Spears\u2019 vulnerable revelations about her relationship with Timberlake appeared in her memoir, \u201cThe Woman in Me.\u201d \u201cShe going crazy, right?\u201d Timbaland responded, according to video of the event. \u201cI wanted to call and say, \u2018JT, man, you gotta put a muzzle on that girl.\u2019\u201d  People in the audience appear to laugh at the remark in the video. But online, the clip sparked outrage after it began circulating, with thousands calling out Timbaland\u2019s comments for being misogynistic or in poor taste.

Representatives for Spears and Timberlake did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  \u201cTimbaland saying that Justin Timberlake should have put a \u2018muzzle\u2019 on Britney is actually INSANE considering Britney has been treated like a caged animal for the past 13 years,\u201d a fan account for Spears wrote on X.

An X user posted in response to the clip of Timbaland\u2019s comments, \u201cThe most interesting thing is watching all the fellas in and adjacent to that memoir never call Britney a liar, just say she shouldn\u2019t have said it.\u201d  The video also circulated on Instagram, where a viral post by the celebrity news account The Shade Room amassed thousands of comments criticizing Timbaland. \u201cA MUZZLE!? on a woman who is speaking her truth and after being traumatized her whole life?\u201d a user replied. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely shocked and disappointed timbaland said this.\u201d \u201cSorry but this is such a disgusting insensitive thing to say,\u201d another wrote.

        "content": "There\u2019s no real \u201cbad blood\u201d between the internet and journalist Bryan West \u2014 but there are a lot of questions about what his new role as Gannett\u2019s official Taylor Swift correspondent actually will entail. The newspaper chain hired West, 35, as its dedicated Swift reporter for USA Today \u2014 ending a search that started with a viral job posting in September.  Hundreds \u2014 including veteran news journalists and a White House beat reporter \u2014 applied for the role, Michael Anastasi, Gannett\u2019s vice president of local news, told Variety. The application sought a journalist who could \u201ccapture the music and cultural impact of Taylor Swift.\u201d It was posted as Swift continues to dominate headlines \u2014 from coverage of her widely successful Eras Tour (and subsequent concert movie) to recent buzz around her reported relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But news of West\u2019s hiring, which was announced in Monday\u2019s Variety article and by The Tennessean newspaper of Nashville, was met with skepticism online by many journalists and Swifties alike.  Some said they had reservations about Gannett\u2019s hiring a self-proclaimed Swiftie, saying they hope West\u2019s coverage will hold pop culture\u2019s most powerful woman accountable. Many said they were disappointed that a man was hired to cover a woman who makes female-centric music. Others simply shared that they don\u2019t agree with the way West ranked Swift\u2019s music in his video application, which was shared to YouTube on Monday.   \u201cNot a lot going on at the moment,\u201d West wrote Monday on X, referring to a popular shirt Swift wore in a music video for \u201c22.\u201d \u201cSo excited for this new chapter!\u201d When the job was unveiled, social media was abuzz with similar conversations \u2014 and memes. Gannett drew additional viral responses when it also said it plans to hire a dedicated Beyonc\u00e9 reporter, who has yet to be announced.  In West\u2019s video application, which had been viewed just over 9,000 times on YouTube as of Tuesday evening, he outlines 13 reasons he should be hired. Other than his love for Swift \u2014 whom he once met and took a picture with \u2014 he also shared how his knowledge of her would come in handy. West shared that he felt he would be able to report on Swift without bias, listing some of her songs that he doesn\u2019t like. In the interview with Variety, he elaborated on that point. He compared the role to that of sports journalists who are fans of the home teams they cover. He said that in Phoenix, where he previously worked, anchors and journalists would wear clothing featuring the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 baseball team logo and root for the team while they covered it.  But even though he shared his qualifications and enthusiasm, some still shared their reservations about his hiring.  \u201cthis job was a trap: media people don\u2019t respect this guy because he\u2019s a stan, the swifties don\u2019t respect him because he\u2019s not the right kind of stan,\u201d media writer Max Tani posted on X. \u201cThe \u2018Taylor Swift Reporter\u2019 role probably should have been filled by someone whose focus was the music industry (with a strong knowledge of Taylor Swift) and not a massive Swiftie who happens to be a reporter,\u201d a person posted to X.  Another joked: \u201cof course the most important thing for a reporter to have is an emotional, unyielding adoration for their subject.\u201d Some seemed to joke that some of the songs West listed as his \u201cleast favorite\u201d should be enough to get him to lose the role. \u201cFALSE GOD?! GET HIM FIRED,\u201d a person posted to X. But the most prominent complaint seemed to be about West\u2019s gender, with some saying Swift\u2019s ability to convey the female experience requires a female reporter.  \u201cone of the main components of taylor swift\u2019s whole brand/ personality is the fact that she is able to perfectly put into words the experience of womanhood\u2026 so who was the genius who decided to give a man this job???  (especially a man who can\u2019t even name her songs correctly),\u201d a person posted to X, referring to how, in Variety's story, had West had called one of Swift\u2019s songs \u201cIt\u2019s Good to Have a Friend,\u201d rather than its correct title, which is \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend.\u201d (West later clarified in a TikTok that he had gotten the song\u2019s name right, saying Variety had since corrected the error in its story. He said he appreciated other Swifties' dedication to accuracy.) One person online critical of West's hiring simply quoted Swift\u2019s lyrics from the song \u201cThe Man\u201d to describe how they felt upon seeing West\u2019s hiring.  \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so sick of running as fast as I can/Wondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a man,\u2019\u201d a person wrote. \u201cHuh. Wonder who wrote that.\u201d Ben Goad, the news director of The Tennessean, expressed optimism about West and the future of the beat.  West is \u201cgoing to be on video, going to be on social, going to be interacting with Swifties, and going to be out and about at tour stops, on red carpets, at the CMAs, wherever people are enjoying or reflecting on who Taylor Swift is,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of things to write. You know, it\u2019s not unprecedented to have somebody (dedicated to covering) someone who\u2019s a Senate candidate, or an athlete, like when LeBron James goes to Miami and has people just covering him. So I think there\u2019s precedent for it. But also, I think, we\u2019re taking a pretty bold step here, and I\u2019m very optimistic for how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Gannett referred to a Swift lyric from her hit \u201cShake It Off.\u201d \u201cRegarding the internet response: The haters gonna hate ... and you know the rest,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email statement.

        "title": "JLo is Hollywood's idea of a middle-aged Latina actor, based on 16 years of movies",
        "content": "In the world created by Hollywood, very few middle-aged and older Latina women are lead protagonists. The few who are, are shapely, slim-legged, ageless Puerto Ricans with glorious tresses. Hollywood has had a lead or co-lead character who was played by a 45 or older Latina in just five of 1,600 top-grossing films in 16 years. In three of those five films, Jennifer Lopez played the role, a new study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found. The group is based at the University of Southern California. Lopez had the lead as an older woman who has a tryst with her 19-year-old neighbor in \u201cThe Boy Next Door,\u201d as a big-box store worker who lands a high-powered job in \u201cSecond Act,\u201d and in the romantic comedy \u201cMarry Me.\u201d \u201cJLo is amazing and she continues to be successful, but there are storylines and people that represent the nuance and diversity of this community; most simply aren\u2019t getting the opportunity,\u201d said Stacy Smith, founder of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, a think tank on inequality in the entertainment industry. \u201cIf we are trying to think about the multidimensional complex nature of this community, there\u2019s a complete disconnect if JLo has to represent every Latina 45 and above. The people that greenlight or allocate the resources on this community don\u2019t understand anything about the community,\u201d Smith said. Across the board, just 14 Hispanic or Latino actors over the age of 45 played lead roles in the 1,600 films made from 2007 to 2022. And in lead roles for all ages, just 4.4% were played by a Hispanic actor. Only one protagonist was played by an Afro Latina, Nathalie Emmanuel in \"The Invitation,\" in the 100 top-grossing films of 2022, and eight Afro Latinos were cast in leading or co-leading roles in the 1,600 films made from 2007-2022. Only three U.S.-born Latinos held the lead or co-lead in films made in 2022. In the 16 years studied, the majority of U.S-born Latino actors who were in leads or co-leads were only hired once in that span of years. The study found no instances of a male U.S.-born Latino who was cast as a lead or co-lead in more than one film. Female actors overall have seen some recent, slight progress in their presence in Hollywood films. They were 37% of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2022, up from 34% in 2021, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. However, Latinas saw their presence drop from 9.5% in 2021 to 7% in 2022, that study showed. Smith\u2019s review of the costs and spending on films and their scores from Metacritic, which aggregates film reviews and scores them using a mathematical formula, showed that even though films with a Latino lead had higher Metacritic scores, less was spent to make them and market them, and they were in fewer theaters. She said the scores mean the films with Latino leads are better but are getting less money. Though movies with Latino leads have made just as much money at the box office as those with non-Latino leading actors, the study found the actors and people working on the films with Latino leads were paid less, Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole issue of having to work twice as hard to get half as far,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis community is not valued by the people that are making the decisions in the executive branch.\u201d Ana-Christina Ram\u00f3n is the director of the Entertainment and Media Research Initiative at University of California, Los Angeles, which produces the annual Hollywood Diversity Report. The initiative released its 10th annual report this year examining the relationship between diversity and finances in the top 200 English-language theatrical films released globally and top 100 English-language streaming films. Its study showed Latinos had 2.3% of leads in theatrical films examined, compared to 78.4% for white actors. Latinos fared better in streaming with 6% of leads, compared to 66.7% held by white actors. Ram\u00f3n said the initiative has gotten similar findings on budgets and resources, with films made by women and people of color receiving less money than those made by white men. The strongest predictor of the type of budget for a film is the director. \u201cParticularly for people of color, you will find there will be a lead that is a man of color and if he has a white director, then he\u2019s fine,\u201d Ram\u00f3n said. \u201cIt was very difficult to get your movie made when you\u2019re the director and you\u2019re the person of color, or when you are a white woman,\u201d she said. Female directors and women of color directors tended to have more diverse casts, and even when a director of color had a white lead, they often still got fewer resources. Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro, D-Texas, has been intensely scrutinizing racial diversity and representation in the media industry. He ordered a two-part Government Accountability Office study that made several recommendations after its similar findings, including improved data sharing between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates media, regarding discrimination. Lack of diversity in the media workforce \"has led to those lopsided and uneven portrayals that then create a stigma for an entire community,\" Castro said in 2022.

        "title": "Matthew Perry prevented Chandler from cheating on Monica in 'Friends'",
        "content": "The late Matthew Perry nixed a \"Friends\" storyline that would have put his beloved character in bed with another woman, the actor cast as his would-be fling revealed Tuesday. Perry feared that fans would \"never forgive\" Chandler Bing for cheating on Monica Geller \u2014 his on-screen love interest played by Courteney Cox \u2014 according to actor Lisa Cash, who had been tabbed to play the other woman. For two days, Cash rehearsed the role of a Las Vegas hotel worker bringing room service to Chandler, who was upset that Monica had lunch with her former boyfriend Richard, played by Tom Selleck. And in the course of Chandler pouring his heart out, he was set to cheat on Monica with Cash's character. But on the day Cash's part was going to be shot, an assistant director told her that the scene \u2014 and her role \u2014 had been cut, she recalled. \"Matthew Perry said the audience would never forgive him,\" Cash told NBC News on Tuesday. \"Matthew Perry went to the writers and said the audience would never forgive him (Chandler), which made a lot of sense.\" Cash said Perry was correct and that a cheating arc could have altered the show. \u201cI think he was very right,\u201d Cash, 54, said from her home in suburban Atlanta. \u201cThe Ross and Rachel (David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston) thing, \u2018They were on a break,\u2019 but this wouldn\u2019t have been on a break. This would have been a decision he would have made while they were together.\u201d She continued: \u201cI think it would have really changed how the audience would have (viewed) Chandler and that whole thing. I don\u2019t know if they could have survived it.\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d still used Cash in that Season 5 episode \u2014 \u201cThe One in Vegas: Part I,\u201d which aired May 20, 1999 \u2014 casting her as a flight attendant. Over the years, Cash has wondered how that potential role as Chandler\u2019s fling could have impacted her career. \u201cI wonder a lot because I could have been, \u2018Oh, that character that you love to hate.\u2019 But I could have also been the girl who broke up Chandler and Monica and no one would forgive,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I could have gotten a lot of bad publicity from it. But I wouldn\u2019t have minded finding out. But I do think it was the best decision for the show and, in the end, that was the most important.\u201d Representatives for Warner Bros. TV and show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Even though Perry ended up pulling rank to get that storyline killed, Cash said the actor never showed his displeasure during rehearsal. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at all, that he had a problem with it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he was completely professional (during rehearsals). He made me feel very comfortable in the scene and we just had fun and we played and did what actors are supposed to do.\u201d David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "TikTok is ending its $2 billion creator fund",
        "content": "TikTok is shutting down its $2 billion Creator Fund, a 2020 initiative designed to help pay eligible users making content on the app, a spokesperson for the platform confirmed Monday. The fund was intended to \"help support ambitious creators who are seeking opportunities to foster a livelihood through their innovative content\" by providing them with money distributed through the fund over three years, according to a July 2020 news release from TikTok. The pool of money was distributed based on creators\u2019 shares of the platform\u2019s overall views. But after the fund launched, many creators were vocal about their concerns, saying it was making monetization on TikTok difficult. Hank Green, who was an early YouTube star and is considered an authority on the culture of the internet, was among those who publicly voiced his concerns last year, saying the fund was outdated. He argued that rather than working in its creators\u2019 best interests, TikTok\u2019s monetization tool worked in favor of the platform's bottom line. Other creators quickly echoed Green's complaint, sharing the little income they generated from the platform despite having racked up large viewership numbers. At the time, Green \u2014who has 8 million followers on TikTok \u2014 said that per 1,000 views, he was making about 2.5 cents. The fund will be discontinued on Dec. 16 in the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany, according to The Verge and Fortune. A spokesperson for TikTok confirmed to NBC News that the fund is shuttering but did not share its end date or any further details. \u201cThe Creativity Program was developed based on the learnings and feedback we\u2019ve gained from the previous Creator Fund,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email statement. \u201cAs we continue developing new ways to reward creators and enrich the TikTok experience, we value the feedback and direct insights from our community to help inform our decisions.\" The news comes just months after TikTok unveiled its Creativity Program, which sought to resolve some creators' initial complaints about the fund. In a blog post about the Creativity Program in February, TikTok said creators can \"earn up to 20 times the amount previously offered by the Creator Fund.\" Videos that are eligible for the program must be longer than a minute and earn at least 1,000 views, and they must abide by the platform's community guidelines, among other criteria. To apply for the Creativity Fund, which appears to still be in beta, creators must be based in the U.S. and over age 18, and they must have had more than 10,000 followers and at least 100,000 video views in the last 30 days. It was not immediately clear whether TikTok plans to include global creators in a different monetization program.

        "content": "Kourtney Kardashian Barker gave birth this week to her first child with husband Travis Barker, according to two sources close to Kardashian Barker. Kardashian Barker, who married the Blink-182 drummer last year and announced her pregnancy in June, welcomed a baby boy. The couple had documented Kardashian Barker\u2019s struggle to get pregnant on the Hulu television series \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d The show followed her journey as she started IVF treatments. She later announced that she had stopped the process and would leave her family planning in God\u2019s hands. In September, Kardashian Barker underwent \u201curgent fetal surgery\u201d and credited her doctors with saving her baby\u2019s life. Several Blink-182 shows were postponed and Barker briefly left the tour to be with his wife. \u201cAs someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery,\u201d she wrote on Instagram at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who hasn\u2019t been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear.\u201d Kardashian Barker, a reality television star and founder of lifestyle and wellness company Poosh, revealed her pregnancy by re-creating a scene from a Blink-182 video. While in the audience at one of the band\u2019s shows, she held up a giant handwritten sign that read \u201cTravis I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d The moment, captured on video and shared on her Instagram page, was a reenactment of Blink-182\u2019s 1999 video for the hit song \u201cAll the Small Things,\u201d in which a woman does the same thing. A stunned Barker jumped down from the stage and hugged and kissed his wife. Kardashian Barker shares three other children with her former partner, Scott Disick: Mason, 13; Penelope, 11; and Reign, 8.

        "content": "A surprise guest at a college football game in Texas on Thursday became a viral celebrity overnight. An opossum, whose name is unknown, ran across the field during Texas Tech University\u2019s home game against Texas Christian University and quickly captivated the internet. \u201cRodents of unusual size are showing up in Lubbock,\u201d a commentator on the Fox broadcast said, referring to a clip of the opossum. \u201cHe was not happy about being escorted out of the stadium,\u201d another commentator said. The opossum was wrangled by stadium authorities before reaching the 20-yard line, but that didn\u2019t stop it from becoming the talk of X. The animal, which appeared to be intensely displeased about its ejection from the game, is already establishing itself as a meme, just 12 hours after its television debut. \"FREE HIM,\" one user said in a post. \"HE DID NOTHING WRONG.\" \"My dog when I drag her away from a cigarette butt she wanted to eat off the road,\" one user joked in response to the footage of the opossum being dragged off the field. \u201cThere\u2019s not a chance TCU wins this game now,\u201d another user wrote in a post. After the game, the opossum appears to have received a well-deserved pet from the university\u2019s president, Lawrence Schovanec, according to a photo that circulated on social media. \"With no disrespect toward the TCU Frogs\u2026.If you were in Lubbock last night, Jones AT&T Stadium was the place to be,\" Schovanec said in an emailed statement to NBC News. \"Can\u2019t blame the possum for wanting to be part of the action. Possums do eat frogs, and he may have heard there would be a lot of frogs in the stadium.\" The animal's special appearance turned out to be a harbinger of good luck for the Red Raiders, who defeated TCU 35-28. Even the official Texas Tech Football account joined in on the fun. \"Pretty possum night, wouldn\u2019t y\u2019all say?\" the account posted on X. The Texas Tech Football account encouraged fans to engage with the new good luck charm online, posting a photo of the marsupial with its teeth bared and claws digging into the turf. \"Caption it,\" the account wrote. Fans rallied on social media to make the opossum the new Texas Tech mascot. Team mascot the Masked Rider was reportedly horseless for Thursday's game. Even the horse's stand-in was unavailable, the school said on X. \"We are an opossum school now,\" one fan responded. ",

        "content": "Taylor Swift takes her final bow at the movie box office this weekend. After a whirlwind four weeks in theaters, the singer\u2019s Eras Tour concert film has shattered records and helped the theater industry weather a light release calendar. Heading into its final weekend, the Eras Tour film has collected $150 million in domestic receipts and more than $200 million globally. That global haul represents more than 18% of the $1.092 billion total global box office earned since the film was released Oct. 13, according to data from Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable, one-of-a-kind, record-breaking and influential run for the Eras Tour, not to mention a huge win for Taylor Swift and theater owners,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. Expectations are that Swift will add another $10 million domestically this weekend and could be the number one film at the box office once again. So far, the Eras Tour film is the highest-grossing domestic and global concert film release of all time, but lags just behind \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It\u201d concert documentary\u2019s global haul of $262.5 million. Swift\u2019s concert film release came at an opportune time. Labor strikes in Hollywood led a number of films to depart the theatrical calendar, including the much-anticipated \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d from Warner Bros. Discovery and Legendary Entertainment. \u201cOne movie can make all the difference,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cThis incredible box office performance is made all the more impressive given the film\u2019s truncated release pattern that had it essentially playing on big screens four days a week.\u201d Swift\u2019s unique release, coupled with her decision to distribute the film through the theater chain AMC instead of a traditional Hollywood studio, has also led to increased speculation about where the concert film will land on streaming. Currently, it appears that Swift is waiting for the SAG-AFTRA strike to wrap up before negotiating with streamers for the rights to her concert film. The film is much-coveted in the industry and a big bidding battle is expected. Swift has previously worked with Apple Music, Netflix and Disney to release filmed versions of her concerts and documentary projects. ",

        "content": "HBO and Max CEO and chairman Casey Bloys apologized to TV critics Thursday for using fake Twitter accounts to respond to negative reviews of HBO series, following a Wednesday report that revealed Bloys\u2019 past behavior. \u201cFor those of you who know me, you know that I am a programming executive very, very passionate about the shows that we decide to do. And the people who do them and the people who work on them,\u201d Bloys said Thursday morning at the start of a presentation at HBO\u2019s New York headquarters, an event to promote HBO and Max\u2019s upcoming slate of programming, which has been planned since Oct. 16. \u201cI want the shows to be great. I want people to love them. I want you all to love them. It\u2019s very important to me what you all think of the shows,\" Bloys said. \"When you think about that, and then think of 2020 and 2021, I\u2019m working from home and doing an unhealthy amount of scrolling through Twitter. And I come up with a very, very dumb idea to vent my frustration.\u201d Bloys continued, \u201cObviously, six tweets over a year and a half is not very effective. But I do apologize to the people who were mentioned in the leaked emails, texts.\" \"Obviously, nobody wants to be part of a story that they have nothing to do with. But also, as many of you know, I have progressed over the past couple of years to using DMs,\" he said. \"So now, when I take issue with something in a review, or take issue with something I see, many of you are gracious enough to engage with me in a back and forth and I think that is a probably a much healthier way to go about this. But we\u2019ll talk more about that, and you guys can ask me anything you want in the Q&A. I just wanted to put that out there.\u201d From there, the HBO chief moved on to start the presentation with footage from the upcoming season of \u201cTrue Detective: Night Country.\u201d Bloys\u2019 remarks come one day after Rolling Stone published a story detailing a lawsuit brought against the exec and HBO from former employee Sully Temori, who claims to have been wrongfully terminated. Though not included in the lawsuit itself, Rolling Stone referenced alleged 2020 and 2021 text messages between Bloys and SVP of drama programming Kathleen McCaffrey. In the alleged text exchanges, Bloys and McCaffrey repeatedly discussed replying to critics who spoke negatively about HBO series, including \u201cPerry Mason\u201d and \u201cMare of Easttown,\u201d by using fake Twitter accounts. Rolling Stone says these text messages, provided by Temori, were reviewed and verified via their metadata. Temori, who at that time was an executive assistant, claims he was instructed to make a Twitter account for these purposes, which he did and attributed it to the fake person Kelly Shepard, a self-described vegan Texan mom. Temori sent tweets from this account in response to critics\u2019 negative reviews. Additionally, Temori told Rolling Stone that he left anonymous comments on some Deadline articles in response to other users\u2019 negative remarks about HBO series and execs, at Bloys\u2019 request. Also mentioned in Temori\u2019s lawsuit are McCaffrey, HBO head of drama Francesca Orsi, Abel \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d Tesfaye and two producers on his now-canceled HBO drama \u201cThe Idol.\u201d Temori alleges that he was mistreated on the set of that series once he became a scripted coordinator on the project in 2021, a position he was moved to from his executive assistant role.

For Halloween, I stupidly thought it would be funny to dress as Johnny Depp and Amber Heard,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am deeply sorry and ashamed for putting something that awful out in the universe. \u201cDomestic abuse is never, ever funny. These are real issues with real people and I REALLY regret my actions.\u201d She concluded that going forward she \u201cwill do better.\u201d Depp and Heard were married from 2015-2016. One week after filing for divorce, Heard filed for a restraining order on grounds of domestic abuse. Depp denied the allegations. A judge dismissed the abuse charges as they reached a divorce settlement. In 2022, Heard faced Depp in court after he brought a high-profile defamation case against her for an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post where she referenced being a victim of domestic abuse, though she did not name Depp. As both Depp and Heard testified about their experiences at the trial, Heard became the target of online vitriol. The jury found Heard guilty of defamation and awarded Depp more than $10 million in damages. Initially, Heard appealed the decision but in December 2022, the two exes settled outside of court. Heard agreed to pay $1 million in damages to the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d actor, which his legal team said he planned to donate to charities. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to say that I never chose this. I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed. The vilification I have faced on social media is an amplified version of the ways in which women are re-victimised when they come forward,\u201d Heard wrote at the time. \u201cI have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward,\u201d she added. Depp\u2019s attorneys issued a statement at the time saying they were \u201cpleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter\u201d for their client. \u201cThis was never about the money,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe jury\u2019s unanimous decision and the judgment in his favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place, and the payment of $1M reinforces her acknowledgment of the legal system\u2019s rigorous pursuit for justice.\u201d ",

        "content": "An online ad featuring an artificial intelligence-generated version of Scarlett Johansson without her permission appears to no longer be online following a request from the actor\u2019s attorney. Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar allegedly used actual footage of Johansson from a campaign she did in conjunction with Omaze, a for-profit fundraising company that often partners with celebrities, and Marvel Studios, according to Variety.  NBC News has not viewed the advertisement. It appears to no longer be on X, where it originated. \u201cWe do not take these things lightly,\u201d Kevin Yorn, Johansson\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cPer our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have.\u201d The advertisement first began to bubble up on X around Saturday. Text under the advertisement read, \u201cImages produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person,\u201d according to Variety. Lisa AI is one of a number of AI apps that have flooded the market in recent months. It lets users \u201ccreate amazing artworks with AI,\u201d including text suggestions that produce images, its website says. As of Wednesday night, the app appeared to be available on both Google\u2019s Play Store and Apple\u2019s App Store. Representatives for Lisa AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Johansson is the latest celebrity to take issue with the alleged misuse of her likeness in AI, as deepfakes \u2014 a type of artificial media in which people\u2019s faces are replaced with those of other people \u2014 and the technology behind them becomes more sophisticated. Actors have also been sounding the alarm about AI images for some time. The digitally altered images have been a sticking point in the negotiations between the Hollywood studios and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union, which is on strike.  Last month, actor Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that he had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d a computer-generated image of him \u201cpromoting some dental plan.\u201d Zelda Williams, the daughter of the late actor/comedian Robin Williams, called the AI recreations of him circulating on the internet \u201cpersonally disturbing.\u201d And YouTube star Jimmy Donaldson, who goes by Mr Beast, also shared with his millions of followers that a deepfake advertisement using his likeness was a scam. The advertisement he posted about was quickly removed from TikTok.  Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

The crash occurred around 9 p.m. Tuesday near the intersection of LaBrea Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Ambulances were requested for two people, who were not publicly identified: a 40-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man.  Los Angeles police are investigating.

        "title": "'Coco' and Day of the Dead rituals can help children, families deal with death and grief",
        "content": "Few topics are as complex for children to deal with as death.  But films like \"Coco\" by Disney Pixar have put death as the protagonist \u2014 and that has invited children and adults to approach it not with sadness or fear but as a tribute to life itself: If children ask what happens when someone dies, the message is that we remember them, because memory is life. \u201cWe die physically but the memory will always be alive,\u201d Regina Cant\u00fa, a thanatologist and emotional coach, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \u201cThe movie \"Coco\" leaves us with that teaching in general: how to approach this issue with children. It is taking advantage, in a good sense, of the topic of death. ... We\u2019re not like video games, where characters come back. We are finite. When are we going to die? Nobody knows,\u201d she added.  Children take note of adults\u2019 reactions to death. \u201cIf adults see death as something natural in life and transmit that to children, then there will not be so much fear or taboo on this topic,\u201d explains Alicia Hinojosa, a psychologist who has a doctorate in thanatology. For those who grow up celebrating the D\u00eda de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead tradition which originated in Mexico, this holiday can offer an encouraging perspective on the loss of a loved one. \u201cFor me, thinking about the Day of the Dead is like a celebration of life and the impact that those people had on us. It was always a very jovial celebration, very full of joy because we were doing something that we thought they (the deceased) would like. We feel like we are throwing a surprise party for those who beat us to it,\u201d said Rossy Lima, a writer and doctor in linguistics at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. It's a different way to approach a topic that, in most cultures, is primarily painful and sometimes macabre. \u201cI think that, culturally, it is a very different way of seeing death, but I think it is also a very healthy way of seeing death,\u201d Adrian Molina, co-creator and co-writer of the film \"Coco,\" said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \u201cWe have all lost someone and it has helped us make peace (with the loss) to think that they are still with us.\" And for children who did not get to know important members of their families, the tradition of the altar of the dead is an opportunity to hear their stories and address concerns about death. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. \u201cThe altar of the dead encourages these conversations and, as parents, we must be prepared to answer the children\u2019s questions,\u201d said Andrea Menchaca, a resident of Monterrey in northern Mexico, who usually dedicates the altar to her father, who died in 2003. \u201cBy putting up my dad\u2019s photo and things, it opens up a conversation about who he was since they didn\u2019t know him,\u201d she said referring to her children, 11 and 9 years old. \u201cIt also opens up the conversation about death: They want to know why he died, how he died and what I felt. You tell them that it hurts you a lot because you love the person a lot, but you also give thanks for everything you experienced.\" Lima, who is also a poet, said that celebrating the Day of the Dead helped her connect to her Mexican roots. However, when she was little, before the celebration became popular, some neighbors did not understand it. \u201cMany were from northern Mexico and did not celebrate it. Others, also due to religious orientations, thought it was like witchcraft,\u201d she said. She said her mother, who's a seamstress, would put a sheet on top of the family's altar during Day of the Dead celebrations, but \"I think the movie \"Coco\" helped a lot to normalize having an altar at home. It also helped because we struggled to find the components of the altar, things as specific as the Cempas\u00fachil flower,\u201d or marigolds that are part of D\u00eda de los Muertos celebrations. After the death of her maternal grandfather in 2016, Lima said, the Day of the Dead celebration was significant since they couldn't attend the funeral. They looked for a great photo of him and chose to put a blue sail on his altar to remember his blue boat. In the case of families who don't celebrate D\u00eda de los Muertos, the lives of those who died can also be celebrated through small moments, according to thanatologist Delia Salinas. \u201cFor example, at mealtime, if you make a soup that your grandpa really liked, it's a good opportunity to talk to the children about that family member.\" Both Lima and Molina say that after the release of \"Coco,\" they saw more acceptance of the Day of the Dead tradition. \u201cBefore the movie, I think there were a lot of people who longed for that connection with their loved ones and maybe a connection with their culture,\u201d Molina said. \u201cWe put a lot of effort into helping to invite the audience to understand the purpose of the tradition \u2026 to really show the vitality and the love of that practice and, yes, in some way normalize it or help people understand the meaning behind those symbols.\" \u201cWe found that there was a really deep emotion that came up in people when they were able to sit with this idea of having permission to talk about the people they miss, having permission to tell stories,\u201d he said. Currently, numerous cities in the United States hold D\u00eda de los Muertos festivals and parades to celebrate Nov. 1 and 2. Cities such as Houston, San Antonio and Corpus Christi, in Texas, display altars and invite people to participate in the different celebrations. In Los Angeles, altars are set up with offerings and public spaces are decorated with Cempas\u00fachil flowers and confetti. Hollywood Forever Cemetery, for example, says it hosts California\u2019s largest Day of the Dead celebration, covering the cemetery grounds with altars and art displays, accompanied by dance and musical performances.  When talking about death, the first thing is to be honest, said Hinojosa, who is also president of the Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Mexico Foundation, which provides guidance around end-of-life issues. \u201cMany times, parents or people who take care of the children are afraid to bring up the subject and they think the children will be scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they get more scared when they see that there are sad faces, that something is happening and they don\u2019t know what ... if it is not made clear to them what is happening, then the mourning drags on for a long time.\u201d If the Day of the Dead or a movie like \"Coco\" puts the topic on the table, experts emphasize that it is important to talk with the little ones about what is happening, what the movie is showing, and explain to children that \u201cdeath is universal, it is irreversible and it is no one\u2019s fault,\" Hinojosa said. When there is a loss in the family, Hinojosa said, it should be a close relative who explains the situation to the child. The expert also explained it's important to listen to the little ones and validate their feelings.  \u201cIf a child gets very angry, it is about hugging them and validating what they feel,\u201d says the thanatologist. \u201cIt is telling the child: you are right, it also hurts me that your father is no longer with us, I miss him too, but we are going to move forward together, as a family, and I am going to take care of you.\u201d Hinojosa also alerts caregivers that children experience grief differently than adults . \u201cAdults are permanently sad and little by little they recover,\" she said. \"Children\u2019s grief is intermittent. Sometimes they feel sad and sometimes they feel good. Is not fixed\u201d.  The skulls that are part of the Day of the Dead also bring an element of humor to a topic that, in most cultures, is somber. There are the sugar and chocolate skulls that children enjoy and the \u201cliterary skulls,\u201d small satirical poems that joke about the ways in which death could take someone. They normally refer to the personality of the person they refer to and their tastes. A common activity in Mexican schools in the weeks before the Day of the Dead is to write literary skulls. Teachers can ask students to write one about a classmate and newspapers usually publish their own skulls about politicians or artists. There are also local and national literary skull contests. \u201cTo write the skull, you have to have a creativity that has to be like the fine line between tender and gloomy,\u201d Lima said.

        "title": "D\u00eda de los Muertos is a colorful tradition to remember loved ones. Here's what it means.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a time for family and friends to remember their late loved ones and according to tradition, reunite with them. The two-day celebration, which takes place annually on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, is not a somber holiday. Instead, it celebrates and honors the dead with festivities filled with color, music and food. Originating and widely observed in Mexico, the holiday has since expanded into Latin America and the United States, including Los Angeles, where the Hollywood Forever Cemetery holds an annual D\u00eda y Noche de los Muertos event. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration about honoring and keeping alive the memory of your loved ones and believing that one day you\u2019ll be together. (It is believed) on that one day, even though you\u2019re alive, that realm opens up and you\u2019re together on the Day of the Dead,\u201d Deisy Marquez, D\u00eda y Noche de los Muertos event founder, said to TODAY.com ahead of their Oct. 28 event in Los Angeles. \u201cThe celebration, and the event itself, it\u2019s very deep and meaningful for a lot of people and everybody has a different idea (of how to celebrate).\u201d Whether it\u2019s gathering at home or the cemetery, building ofrendas or altars with photos of deceased loved ones and marigolds, dressing up and sharing loved ones' favorite foods, there are many ways to celebrate D\u00eda de los Muertos. D\u00eda de los Muertos originated in Mexico, with the celebrations combining Aztec rituals with Catholicism brought to the region by Spanish colonization, as National Geographic reports. It then became a mix of the Aztec festival in honor of goddess Mictecacihuatl, the \u201cLady of the Dead\u201d who watches over the bones of the dead. The Aztecs would help the deceased on their journey to the afterlife, offering useful objects to guide them and placing them on their burial sites. This would later be known as ofrendas, or offerings, that are placed on the altars or shrines dedicated to the dearly departed. In some places, it begins on Oct. 31, Halloween, and concludes on Nov. 2, also known as All Souls\u2019 Day. Nov. 1 honors deceased children and Nov. 2 focuses on adults. In some regions, as the History Channel reports, it's believed the gates of heaven are opened at midnight on Halloween and the spirits of children can rejoin their families for 24 hours on Nov. 1. The spirits of adults can do the same on Nov. 2. However, there are contradicting stories of how the spirits of the children come on Nov. 1, which showcases how different regions celebrate the holiday differently. To prepare for the spirits\u2019 arrival, people make ofrendas or altars that include photos of the deceased, sugar skulls \u2014 which represent death and rebirth \u2014 as well as favorite foods and belongings of the deceased. The altars also include the flor de Cempasuchil, or marigold, an orange flower that grows around Mexico in the fall. It is included in the ofrendas not only because they are seen everywhere during that time, but because according to Mexican folklore, its strong smell is believed to attract spirits. In Mexico, states and regions celebrate it differently. In Hollywood Forever Cemetery in California, they make it a priority to showcase those differences by holding a unique theme each year. For the past 24 years, Hollywood Forever president Tyler Cassity and Marquez, along with their team, visit a specific state in Mexico and learn about the community\u2019s Day of the Dead customs and rituals. This year for their Oct. 28 event the theme was \u201cM\u00e1scaras de M\u00e9xico \u2014 Vida y Muerte en La M\u00e1scara,\u201d which explored the significance of masks in Mexican and Latin American culture during the Day of the Dead and was inspired by the late Mexican painter Rafael Coronel, who was chosen as the artist of the year. \u201cThe significance of the mask is that it\u2019s a transformative part of a ritual. As you are dying, moving on to the next life, you\u2019re putting on a mask so that you can still see yourself as you were,\u201d Gabriel Avila, director of dance and theme at Hollywood Forever, said. \u201cIt\u2019s also an idealized version of who you want to continue to be,\" Avila said. \"And even though you\u2019ve transpired to another realm, whatever the beauty in the mask is, it still represents who you are and it carries that idea of the soul continuing to live forever.\u201d The event is near and dear to many. It\u2019s also a big family celebration with costume and altar contests, live music and food vendors celebrating Mexican culture at the cemetery. Cassity noted that their celebration is not just for people of Mexican heritage but for all Angelenos and those who want to pay tribute to their loved ones. Marquez said that it\u2019s a way for immigrants and people who can\u2019t go back to Mexico or their native land to honor their culture, family and friends. \u201cWe have people from all around the world that know about it,\u201d Marquez said. \u201cWe try to give some insight into Mexican culture but at the same time it is embraced by so many different countries.\u201d Aside from celebrations in towns and cities, families make intimate at-home altars or decorate their loved one\u2019s burial site and hold a picnic or celebration. Others will attend special Catholic masses and have a mariachi. Author Annette Chavez Macias said she didn\u2019t celebrate D\u00eda de los Muertos growing up, but recently started setting up an ofrenda at her home and a mini one at her office. \u201cMy dad is from Mexico and my mom is second-generation Mexican American,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral years ago, I started hearing about it and seeing more of the celebrations on social media and online. By then I had lost some relatives and the symbolism of remembering our loved ones during this time really affected me.\u201d Macias sees D\u00eda de los Muertos \"as a beautiful way to honor their memory\u201d and a way to educate herself on the tradition. As more of her family members join in, they begin setting up their ofrendas in mid-October, adding more until the altar is completed by Oct. 28. They also decorate her dad and grandparents\u2019 graves and try to attend Day of the Dead events in her area. For Rene Flores Juarez, 68, who hails from Atlixco, Mexico and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York, the Day of the Dead is a multi-day celebration starting Oct. 28. As he told TODAY.com in Spanish, on the first day they place a white candle, white flower and a glass of water on the altar for the souls who don't have any family. As the days continue and they are \u201cesperando a nuestros muertitos\u201d (waiting for our deceased), they light another candle, place a glass of water and white bread, fruit and marigolds, among other tokens. By Nov. 1, or All Saints\u2019 Day, he said all the \"angelitos\" (little angels) come, \"the souls of the children who died,\" he explained. On Nov. 1 they put all the food on the altar, Flores Juarez said, because Nov. 2 is when the adult souls return and more personal belongings are placed on the altar. By Nov. 3, they begin to say goodbye to their dearly departed. \u201cThat\u2019s why the fruit spoils and it doesn\u2019t taste the same... It means they have eaten it and have taken it with them,\u201d he said in Spanish. Los Angeles native Brandie Carlos said that growing up in East Los Angeles, she lived two blocks from an art center, Self Help Graphics, where nuns started celebrating the holiday. Her family, who is from Sahuayo, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, began making their own altars at home after being inspired by the local celebration. \u201cSince I was little, I remember putting together the altar with photos of our loved ones and their favorite foods and drinks like rice and beans, birrote (bread), Mexican candy and liquor,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cWe always went to downtown Los Angeles to the flower market to buy fresh marigolds for the altar. We would also make it a point to eat their favorite meals during this time.\u201d For Carlos, because the tradition has become a special part of her family, they have the altar up year-round. \u201cBut we do decorate it more starting mid-to-late-October. We had a death in the family in July, our matriarch, my Nina Marina, and I know it\u2019s going to be extra emotional because she was the one who taught us to create the altar,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now she\u2019ll be on it for the first time.\u201d A version of this story was first published on Today.com.

        "content": "Jason Aldean once again defended his controversial music video for \"Try That in a Small Town\" after critics deemed it \"pro-lynching\" and accused the country music star of trying to incite violence. Critics took issue with some of the lyrics and were notably upset that the video included scenes of a Tennessee courthouse where a Black teenager was lynched in 1927 after he was accused of assaulting a white 16-year-old girl. \"How? There were people of all color doing stuff in the video \u2014 that's what I don't understand,\" Aldean said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings.\" \"There was white people in there, there were Black people. I mean, this video did not shine light on one specific group and say, 'That's the problem.' And anybody that saw that in the video, then you weren't looking hard enough in the video, that's all I can tell you.\" Aldean said he loved the song because he felt like it \"says something for a change.\" He never expected the backlash it got, the singer told CBS. The lyrics include lines such as: \u201cCuss out a cop, spit in his face / Stomp on the flag and light it up / Yeah, ya think you\u2019re tough / Well, try that in a small town / See how far ya make it down the road / \u2019round here we take care of our own.\u201d The music video also features scenes of the American flag being burned and news clips of Black Lives Matter protests projected onto the Tennessee courthouse. In July, the Country Music Television network yanked the video, a decision that angered country music fans and Aldean's supporters. He later removed the Black Lives Matter protest clip from the video. Aldean told CBS that he was unaware of the courthouse's history. \"But I also don't go back 100 years and check on the history of a place before we go shoot it either,\" he said, noting that many places in the South have a grim past. \"Honestly, if you're in the South, you could probably go to any small-town courthouse, you're going to be hard-pressed to find one that hasn't had some sort of racial issue over the years at some point.\" Aldean went on to say that the video was meant to comment on \"the lawlessness and the disrespect for cops and just trashing cities.\" \"I\u2019m just not cool with that,\" he said.

        "title": "Halloween costumes 2023: See what viral moments on TikTok, Instagram inspired looks this year",
        "content": "It\u2019s meme-o-ween on social media. On TikTok, the hashtag \u201c#Halloween\u201d has been viewed more than 3 billion times in the last week, with many online sharing Halloween costumes that were inspired by viral moments, pop culture trends and iconic internet memes. This year, some online said it feels like people went even more all-out with their costumes, flexing their creativity when it came to the execution of their looks. \u201cThere has to be some kind of scientific reason as to why the costumes are just so good this year,\u201d TikTok user @Bmekween said in a compilation video of her favorite costumes she has seen online. Some suggested the Halloween fervor stemmed from people needing an escape from bleak current events (including war, mass shootings and natural disasters). Others suggested that Halloween participants were just more enthusiastic about leaning into pop culture moments and viral phenomena than in years past. Here's a look at some of the most fun costumes being showcased online. In September, the remains of alleged \u201cnonhuman\u201d beings were presented at Mexico\u2019s first public congressional hearing about unidentified anomalous phenomena, also known as UFOs. Images immediately circulated on social media, and the viral \"Mexican aliens bodies\" meme was born, according to Know Your Meme, the meme database. Many joked that Mexico was \"unboxing\" aliens. The news event-turned-meme transformed into a costume for some, including YouTube star Grace Helbig, who unveiled her alien meme costume Monday on Instagram. She also shared the process of getting the costume together in a YouTube video. \"Why yes this is and incredibly niche costume and yes I did have the best time doing it,\" she wrote in the caption of her YouTube video. \"And my apologies the Mexican government did not expose these 'alien' bodies, these 'alien' bodies were presented TO the Mexican government.\" Helbig wasn't alone in her \"niche\" costume pick. Another video of a Mexican alien body costume from TikTok user @Anfre_Bish has been viewed more than 534,000 times. Meanwhile, some were inspired by another viral moment that made headlines in 2023. TikTok user @naazmotv dressed as \u201cPlane Woman,\" or Tiffany Gomas, who was kicked off a flight after an outburst in which she claimed a person at the back of the plane was \u201cnot real.\u201d \u201cIf 2023 was a Halloween costume,\" @naazmotv wrote in her video caption. A Canadian children's television show called \"Nanalan'\" has become one of the latest meme to transfix TikTok. The show features a grandma puppet singing the words \"Who's that wonderful girl? Could she be any cuter?\" to a green baby puppet. The meme has been used to joke about a person's \"point of view.\" TikTok user @AutumnBxx showed herself and another person dressed as the pair from the meme. Another TikToker was inspired by the popular 2022 meme known as \"Me as a little baby.\" The meme is a reference to a video by TikTok user @MestreEnsinador1, who shared clips of a puppet with a pointy green cap and a wispy white body, according to Know Your Meme.  Some parents and older siblings began showing the videos to toddlers and children, telling the little ones that the video was of them \u201cas a baby.\u201d So, naturally, the meme, which took off too late for Halloween 2022, became a staple of the holiday this year. In a video showcasing a person who had dressed as the meme, a commenter asked, \u201cdude, how did you so accurately dress up as me as a baby?\u201d Another person on TikTok, @Taylor_Tarantino, dressed as \"Hip-Hop Dena,\" a dance instructor from a viral video shared in the early 2010s. Dena\u2019s iconic blue top, black pants and close-cut hairstyle are easily recognizable for internet culture enthusiasts, but it\u2019s the choreography from the viral video, followed by the phrase \u201cand that\u2019s what makes it hip-hop,\u201d that takes the costume to another level. @Taylor_Tarantino re-created the outfit and shared a video of herself \u201cpopping\u201d and \u201clocking\u201d with the same goofy swagger that made Dena a meme icon. Local news interviews with kids have become fodder for many memes in the last decade. And now some are using internet nostalgia to fuel their costume choices. In 2007, a viral video featured a kid with zombie face paint replying to a newscaster in Portland, Oregon, \"I like turtles.\" (The question was not about turtles; it was about his face paint.) A TikTok user re-created the clip's chyron as part of the costume. A clip shared by @jb1509 of an \"I like turtles\" costume even showed the user's dog dressed as a turtle in the background. A 2014 video of a boy named Noah Ritter, then 5, being interviewed at the Wayne County Fair in Pennsylvania also inspired a TikTok user this year. Known as the \"apparently kid,\" Noah rambled throughout the interview, punctuating sentences with \"apparently\" over and over again. With her costume, user @JennaTalia4 wore a striped green shirt, like Noah, a red wig and khaki shorts while she held a microphone that read \"16 WNEP.\" Imitating Noah's doe-eyed look into the camera, @JennaTalia4 lip-synced the original audio from the nearly 10-year-old interview. Pop culture has long been a cornerstone of Halloween costumes, and there was no larger pop culture moment in 2023 than Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce and The Eras Tour. Many dressed as Swift and Kelce in outfits matching the singer-football player duo. Some wore costumes representing the friendship bracelets exchanged at Swift's concerts. Some even dressed as the most terrifying costume of all: the Ticketmaster debacle when fans tried to buy tickets to Swift's tour. What could be better for Halloween than a viral video predicated on a celebrity in a costume? User @large.basic.loser shared a video of a costume based on a clip from \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d in which Wendy Williams, who was disguised as The Lips, sang the song \u201cNative New Yorker.\u201d That clip went viral in 2020.

        "title": "Charli D\u2019Amelio gets called out for 'cosplaying' as a Walmart cashier",
        "content": "A viral video of Charli D\u2019Amelio posing as a Walmart cashier has drawn backlash from some social media users, who called out the influencer for \u201ccosplaying\u201d working-class life as a multimillionaire. D\u2019Amelio was recorded posing for photos as she scanned bags of popcorn at the checkout counter with an employee vest and a name tag on.  In a photo posted on her official Instagram account, in which Walmart is tagged, it appears the visit to one of the chain's stores was part of a promotion for the launch of her popcorn line, Be Happy Snacks. The brand\u2019s TikTok page also used video of D\u2019Amelio at Walmart dressed as one if its employees as part of the brand\u2019s overall promotion, writing in the video's text: \"us checking people out knowing they have their new favorite snack.\" The viral backlash is the latest instance of fans\u2019 calling out celebrities for being out of touch. A spokesperson for D\u2019Amelio did not respond to a request for comment about the video and the online response. A spokesperson for the brand also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. D\u2019Amelio was one of the first major creators to rise to TikTok fame in 2019 for her viral dance videos; she quickly became the platform\u2019s most followed creator. She held on to that title for two years, and this year she was named one of Forbes\u2019 Top Five Creators. She made $17.5 million, according to Forbes. Her sister, Dixie, who also appears in some of the promotional videos for the popcorn, also made the list, amassing $11.5 million, according to Forbes. Their family stars in a Hulu reality show, which debuted in 2021. Charli\u2019s dad, Marc D\u2019Amelio, a co-founder and the CEO of D\u2019Amelio Brands, touched on the Walmart partnership in a news release ahead of the popcorn\u2019s launch. \u201cBy collaborating with Walmart, we are able to offer our products to a community of food lovers who celebrate trying new flavors and products nationwide,\u201d he said. Some of D\u2019Amelio\u2019s followers commended her on the launch of a new product in comments on her social media announcement Saturday. But others were quick to criticize her, as well as her sister. In one video, Charli and Dixie stock shelves, ride in shopping carts and go to the register together. \"I wish I had enough money to cosplay as a retail worker, so fun being in the working class,\" a commenter wrote. \"I can barely afford to live as a retail worker but glad ur having fun lol,\" another wrote. The backlash spilled over onto X after the account Pop Crave posted video of Charli at the register. \"i don\u2019t even hate charli d\u2019amelio like that, but there will always be something SOOOOOOO disconnected and sinister about literal millionaires cosplaying working class people who make next to nothing,\" an X user wrote. \"Cosplaying as a cashier at walmart while being a multi millionaire is the cringiest video topic lmao. \u2018Hi guys it\u2019s Charli and today we are going to see how normal people live for a day,\u2019\u201d another X user wrote. Other celebrities have faced similar blowback. In March 2022, a video clip of Kim Kardashian's interview with Variety went viral after she shared her \"best advice for women in business,\" which was \u201cGet your f---ing ass up and work.\u201d \u201cIt seems like nobody wants to work these days,\u201d she added. Following viral backlash, Kardashian said the comment had been \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d Some celebrities appear to get more grace from fans in such instances. Online, some compared D\u2019Amelio's Walmart video to when Lana Del Rey was spotted in Alabama serving customers at a Waffle House last month. The response appeared to be generally positive, with patrons snapping selfies with Del Rey and sharing their excitement online. Del Rey told The Hollywood Reporter that the viral moment stemmed from a casual morning visit to the diner chain. \u201cWe were on our third hour, and the servers asked, \u2018Do you guys want shirts?\u2019\u201d Del Rey said. \u201cHell yeah! We were thrilled.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "L.A. is beefing with NYC again \u2014 over scooped bagels",
        "content": "One Angeleno\u2019s hunt for a scooped bagel in New York City has the internet up in arms, reigniting the city\u2019s long-running culture clash with Los Angeles. L.A. resident and clothing brand founder Taylor Offer posted a video to TikTok last week recounting his attempt to order a scooped gluten-free bagel while he was visiting New York. Back home, he said, he could walk into any bagel shop and the request would draw no questions or appalled glances, but there\u2019s \u201cnothing more stressful\u201d than trying to do the same in the Big Apple. \u201cGuy just looks at me and goes, \u2018Dude, I\u2019m not scooping your f---ing bagel, bro,\u2019\u201d Offer said in the video, which drew more than 8 million views in three days. \u201cIt\u2019s like, dude, that\u2019s how I want it.\u201d Many who stumbled across his post commented that it was the first they had heard of a scooped bagel \u2014 a bagel hollowed out from the inside to leave just the outer shell, oftentimes to limit caloric and carbohydrate intake \u2014 but that after having looked up what it was, the shop worker was right to reject his request. \u201cI\u2019m team bagel shop,\u201d a user commented, racking up more than 125,000 likes. \u201cScooped bagel is a crime.\u201d \u201cGF AND scooped??\u201d another viewer wrote. \u201cI feel like at that point you have to just admit you don\u2019t really want a bagel at all.\u201d Some commenters compared the concept of a scooped bagel to the idea of ordering a muffin just to eat the wrapper or of tossing out the muffin top and keeping only the stump. Offer\u2019s audacity to order such a bagel quickly spawned outrage across the internet. A viral X post sharing his video wrote that the city needs to start \u201cturning californians away at the border.\u201d Many joked the order was so atrocious it should constitute a crime. \u201cCalifornians needs to gtfo out of NYC with this \u2018scooped bagel\u2019 nonsense,\u201d a user posted. \u201cBe a man. Get a bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel, toasted. Maybe even throw a hashbrown in there.\u201d The video also circulated on Reddit, making its way to the r/TikTokCringe community and drawing overwhelming support for the bagel shop worker. \u201cProtect all bagels from this Los Demonese monster,\u201d a Redditor wrote in the thread. Offer appeared to lean into the anti-L.A. discourse, riling up his viewers even further by posting more videos comparing the two cities \u2014 claiming Los Angeles is more fashionable and offers better nightlife, for example, and lamenting the relative dearth of alternative milk choices at New York coffee shops. Some began to suspect he was playing a part. \u201cThis could be a character: guy that thinks LA is the greatest place on earth,\u201d a commenter wrote, adding: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t before, it is now.\u201d Offer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But regardless of whether his later videos turned satirical, he did eventually succeed in getting his scooped bagel. \u201cYou get less bagel, you get more cream cheese. Look at that cream cheese to bagel ratio,\u201d he said, showing his bagel off to the camera before taking a bite. \u201cWow. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Matthew Perry remembered: Friends, colleagues and fans react to death of beloved actor",
        "content": "News of the death of actor Matthew Perry on Saturday night triggered an immediate outpouring of shock and grief. Best remembered for his now-iconic role as Chandler Bing on beloved '90s sitcom \"Friends,\" Perry was found dead on Saturday of an apparent drowning at his Pacific Palisades home. He was 54. There was no indication of foul play and no confirmed cause of death, a law enforcement source told NBC News. An investigation is ongoing. The massive success of \"Friends\" and Perry's indelible performance as the sweetly sarcastic Chandler earned him a legion of admirers. He also garnered admiration for publicly discussing his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. Fans of the iconic show gathered outside the Grove Street building in New York City that was used as the exterior for the famed \u201cFriends\u201d apartment building. Yessy Gutierrez was at dinner when news broke about Perry's death and left to go to the building. She's spent many sleepless nights watching \"Friends\" over the past few years. \"He really fought to have a great life, and so it's kind of sad that he made it out on the other side and he passed away,\" Gutierrez told NBC New York. A 50-year resident of Grove Street, Richard Weigle has seen \"Friends\" fans flock to the apartment building and decided to walk the half a block with his husband to light a candle for Perry. \"We're in our 70s, so when you're 54 it's so young,\" Weigle said. \"We just look at it as such a tragedy. He had so much more to give and so much more life to live. And he's been through a lot. It's just sad.\" Notable public figures of all stripes paid tribute. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Perry's death \"shocking and saddening.\" Perry's mother, Suzanne, served as press secretary for Trudeau's father during his time as prime minister. \"I'll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them,\" Trudeau wrote on X. \"Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved \u2014 and you will be missed.\" Actor Michael Rappaport \u2014 who had a recurring role on \"Friends\" as Gary, one of Phoebe's boyfriends \u2014 said on X that Perry was \"so nice, cool, chill & talented. You are a part of American Culture and will live on forever.\" Maggie Wheeler, who played Chandler's girlfriend Janice, posted a tribute to Perry on Instagram. \"What a loss. The world will miss you Mathew Perry,\" Wheeler wrote. \"The joy you brought to so many in your too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared.\" Soap opera star Morgan Fairchild guest starred as Perry\u2019s mother on \"Friends.\" She wrote on X that she was \"heartbroken\" over Perry's untimely death. \"The loss of such a brilliant young actor is a shock,\" Fairchild said. \"I\u2019m sending love & condolences to his friends & family.\" The official \"Friends\" Instagram account posted that it was devastated to learn of Perry's death. \"He was a true gift to us all,\" it said. Actor Selma Blair posted a selfie of her and Perry to her Instagram, calling him her \"oldest boy friend.\" \"I loved him unconditionally. And he me,\" Blair captioned the photo. \"And I\u2019m broken.\" Castmates from Perry\u2019s sitcom series, \u201cThe Odd Couple,\u201d also shared tributes. Actor Thomas Lennon called Perry \u201cthe best shoulder to lean on.\u201d Yvette Nicole Brown said in a post on X that the show\u2019s family had suffered a great loss. \u201cThe entire entertainment world has,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cI am too sad about the news to say more than this: @mattyperry4 was a sweetheart who deserved more peace in this life. 54 is too young to go.\u201d Wendell Pierce, who also starred on the show, said Perry was \u201cmy boss, my colleague, and a giving, kind, funny man.\u201d  \u201cI pray and hope he is at peace,\u201d Pierce said. Actor Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce Willis \u2014 who costarred with Perry in the movies \u201cThe Whole Nine Yards\u201d and \u201cThe Whole Ten Yards\u201d \u2014 wrote on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m so sad to hear about Matthew Perry passing. When I was a kid and I was on set ... he was so kind and funny and sweet with my sisters and me ... I know he had many challenges in his life and brought a lot of joy to people with his comedy. I hope he can rest peacefully.\u201d Actor Olivia Munn wrote on Instagram, \"He struggle so much with addiction and was brave enough to be open and honest about it. I'm so sorry to his family and friends who are getting this news today. Nothing short of heartbreaking. Rest in love, Matthew Perry.\" Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III said on X, \"Matthew Perry was more than Chandler Bing. He was what made Friends go.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Matthew Perry died Saturday of an apparent drowning at his Pacific Palisades home, a representative for the actor and a law enforcement source said. He was 54. A 911 call came in at 4:07 p.m. local time and was treated as a water rescue, a law enforcement source said. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson Brian Humphrey said first responders went to a home in Pacific Palisades based on a 911 call at 4:07 p.m. about a \u201cwater emergency\u201d of an unknown type. No one was taken to a hospital, he said, and Los Angeles police officers from the West L.A. Division were on the scene. Later Saturday, two law enforcement sources said the police department\u2019s Robbery-Homicide Division, which investigates high-profile crimes and cases involving celebrities, also responded. The sources emphasized that the case was a death investigation with no signs of foul play. The Los Angeles County medical examiner was expected to conduct an autopsy and may determine the cause and manner of death, they said. More details about Perry\u2019s death were not immediately available Saturday night. Perry was best known for his role as one of the core cast members on \u201cFriends,\u201d NBC\u2019s generation X sitcom from the \u201990s. He played Chandler Bing, a statistical analyst who used sarcasm and one-liners. The show was a blockbuster, dominating prime time alongside \"Seinfeld.\" It ran for 10 seasons, from 1994 to 2004. Perry also appeared in several other hits, including \u201cBoys Will Be Boys,\u201d \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d Beverly Hills, 90210,\u201d \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and \u201cScrubs.\u201d Raised in Ottawa, Ontario, Perry had a successful run as a top-ranked tennis player competing in Canadian juniors. He essentially left the sport to pursue acting when he moved to Los Angeles at age 15. He joined the cast of \u201cFriends\u201d at age 24. About a year ago, Perry was on a press tour for the release of his memoir, \u201cFriends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir,\u201d which added to revelations about his battle with addiction, including a near-death experience in 2019 after his colon burst as a result of his use of opioids. His post-\u201cFriends\u201d life included multiple roles that drew respect and acclaim, but it was often dominated by headlines about that battle. In the book, he said he spent as much as $7 million on rehabilitation and recovery efforts. Reaction to Perry's death came from across Hollywood and beyond. Maggie Wheeler, who played Chandler Bing's girlfriend Janice in \"Friends,\" said Perry died too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him in real life and on the screen. She noted Perry's struggles that he shared in his memoir and said she hoped he was at peace. \"Matthew was an incredibly generous actor. There was no single time I stepped onto a stage with him that I did not feel lifted by his brilliance,\" she said. \"Even in his darkest moments his comedic timing was impeccable.\" Warner Bros. Television Group, which produced \"Friends,\" said in a statement Saturday night, \u201cWe are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cThe impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many.\u201d NBC, the network that aired \"Friends,\" said it was saddened. \"He brought so much joy to hundreds of millions of people around the world with his pitch perfect comedic timing and wry wit,\" NBC said in a statement. \"His legacy will live on through countless generations.\" Andrew Blankstein is an investigative reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "An influencer took down 'dupe' videos of her designs. People were divided on the move.",
        "content": "An influencer set off a debate on the ethics of promoting replicas on TikTok after her team requested the platform take down videos featuring dupes \u2014 duplicates of brand-name products \u2014 of her brand\u2019s fruit print pajamas. Matilda Djerf has been a fashion influencer for nearly a decade, and when she launched her brand Djerf Avenue in 2019, she gave fans an opportunity to buy her lifestyle directly. But over the past month, some fans have soured on Djerf, after smaller creators said her company took down their videos mentioning dupes of her clothing line, citing copyright infringement. Dupes typically sell at more affordable prices than the originals. Though dupes have been around for years, dupe videos have skyrocketed in popularity on TikTok in recent months, stirring debate over buying low-quality copies. Dupes can be more accessible to consumers with lower budgets, but some critics believe that they encourage design theft and contribute to fast fashion waste.  Some experts, including fashion creators, say it\u2019s difficult to enforce intellectual property and copyright law in fashion, even for big designer houses. Djerf\u2019s designs are also similar to and inspired by other brands\u2019 pieces in her own wardrobe, critics argued, which made the copyright strikes seem \u201chypocritical.\u201d  Several TikTok creators posted videos this month sharing that their videos mentioning dupes of Djerf Avenue pajamas had been taken down. Two creators said the Djerf Avenue team took down their videos praising the original garments in comparison to the dupes, causing outrage toward Djerf and her team. Critics believe that Djerf\u2019s team was wrong to punish smaller influencers, rather than manufacturers, over the dupes. Several people were shocked that trademarking videos featuring dupes, which are a popular genre of TikTok content, was allowed. The hashtag #djerfavenuedrama on TikTok has amassed 1.5 million views. \u201cThis is low-key scary that they can do this,\u201d one commenter said under a video about the incident.  A representative for Djerf Avenue said that the company has seen a recent \u201csurge\u201d in websites selling items with its trademarked prints. It has an external intellectual property firm that monitors instances of copyright infringement. The IP firm \u201cinadvertently impacted individual accounts,\u201d the representative said in an email statement. \u201cWe have promptly instructed our IP firm to stop reports from individual accounts and focus on third-party sellers of these items. Instead of reporting the individual accounts, we will reach out to the responsible party behind the accounts when we see suspicious pirate copies and have a dialogue with the content creator.\" The TikTok community guidelines prohibit \u201cposting, sharing, or sending any content that violates or infringes upon someone else\u2019s copyrights, trademarks or other IP rights.\u201d Djerf Avenue posted a similar statement on its Instagram Story on Oct. 7, but it didn\u2019t stop the backlash. Djerf briefly deactivated her personal TikTok account because of the controversy and has not publicly responded to the criticism. The strikes fueled additional criticism toward Djerf and her brand, with people saying she was selling overpriced basics and alienating fans who wanted to emulate her style on a budget.  \u201cIt kind of galvanized her community around wanting to actually purchase these dupes kind of in defiance of what they felt were unnecessary copyright strikes,\u201d Mosha Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert, a fashion journalist and host of the podcast \u201cNewsfash,\u201d who made a TikTok about Djerf Avenue, said in an interview. Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said that targeting people in Djerf\u2019s community, rather than the producers of the actual dupes, was like \u201cbiting the hand that feeds you.\u201d  \u201cYou want to influence people to be inspired by your style, but you want to direct that tunnel of inspiration traffic only directly to your own channels and your own site,\u201d Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said. \u201cBut the thing about the internet is you can\u2019t really do that.\u201d Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said the fruit print of the Djerf Avenue pajamas isn\u2019t particularly original, so any slight variance in the dupes\u2019 prints would make it hard to enforce a trademark claim. She added that it is difficult to enforce IP and copyright law in fashion, even for big designer houses. She said attempting to do so on TikTok, where there is a big community around Amazon dupes, backfired for Djerf Avenue and only raised more awareness about the replicas.  While the strikes garnered a lot of backlash, some people defended Djerf\u2019s team on TikTok. Lucinda Pikkat, a content creator and public relations consultant, said in a TikTok that Djerf didn\u2019t deserve the backlash she was receiving. She commended Djerf for taking a stand against her designs being copied. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a counterfeit of her product, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair or right for any company,\u201d Pikkat said in an interview.  While she doesn\u2019t believe the copyright strikes were the best public relations move, Pikkat said that much of the criticism toward Djerf and her brand overlooked the issue of design theft. She said that Djerf understands that people draw inspiration from influencers like her. But there\u2019s a difference between taking inspiration from a person and ripping off their work, she said.  \u201cPeople are profiting off Matilda\u2019s brand by showcasing in a TikTok that they\u2019ve found a dupe,\u201d Pikkat said. She added that it could be \u201cfrustrating\u201d for Djerf to see others capitalize off of her.  Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said the incident raised the question of who is responsible for proliferating knockoffs. She said some influencers with brands, like Djerf, have unrealistic expectations about imitation. \u201cIf you are an influencer, by very nature, you are trying to persuade people to be like you in a number of different ways, which will encourage copying,\u201d Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said. \u201cIf she\u2019s trying to inspire other people to aspire to her lifestyle, the thing about aspiration is not everyone can afford it.\u201d Dupe culture isn\u2019t new, nor will it end anytime soon. Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said it\u2019s an issue in many industries beyond fashion. While dupe culture is popular, she said that owning the real product often feels different and more intentional. Dupes, as demonstrated by some of the copyright struck videos, can even highlight the quality of an original product. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to experiment with duplicates, and seeing that it really doesn\u2019t necessarily always save you money because sometimes all it does is reinforce the real thing,\u201d Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert said.

When Swift released \u201c1989\u201d in 2014, it seemed like she was at her peak. \u201cShake It Off\u201d became a massive hit, the viral \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video featured seemingly every A-lister in Hollywood, and \"1989\" ended up edging out \u201cFrozen\u201d as the most popular album of the year. While Swift\u2019s re-recording journey may have been conceived as an effort to reclaim her work, the \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums have been triumphant successes in their own right. All three re-recordings have debuted at No. 1, with each one performing better than the last. \u201c1989 (Taylor's Version)\u201d is also poised to be a huge success. Here\u2019s what to know. Swift revealed the track list in September in typical Swiftie fashion: with a complicated puzzle for fans to solve. Google announced that its search function would populate a series of 89 puzzles that fans could solve to eventually reveal the names of those new songs. Fans successfully decoded the names of the five vault tracks, or songs that weren\u2019t included on the original album. Swift posted the official track list to her social media platforms on Sept. 20, confirming the vault track titles: \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk,\u201d \u201cSuburban Legends,\u201d \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go,\u201d \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d and \u201c\u2018Slut!\u2019\u201d In an Instagram post announcing the album in August, Swift wrote it was her \u201cmost FAVORITE re-record I\u2019ve ever done because the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe they were ever left behind,\u201d she wrote in the caption. Fans have posted their dream collab artists, including Harry Styles on \u201cStyle,\u201d a track many believe to be about Swift\u2019s former rumored relationship with her fellow pop star. But the former One Direction band member\u2019s vocals are not featured. In terms of producers, the original \u201c1989\u201d was the first collaboration with Jack Antonoff, who has become an integral part of Swift\u2019s discography and social life. He is credited as a producer on every \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d vault track. Other original producing collaborators, such as Max Martin and Imogen Heap, also returned for the re-recorded version of the album. Swift said Friday morning that the re-recording of \"Bad Blood (featuring Kendrick Lamar)\" would be available on \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) Deluxe Edition.\" \"Watching @kendricklamar create and record his verses on the Bad Blood remix was one of the most inspiring experiences of my life... The reality that Kendrick would go back in and re-record Bad Blood so that I could reclaim and own this work I\u2019m so proud of is surreal and bewildering to me,\" Swift posted on X. It wouldn\u2019t be Swiftdom without Easter eggs. Swift and her team unleashed plenty of online speculation ahead of the album release. This week, Swift posted three photos on her Instagram story featuring handwritten notes. The first photo was a notebook entry posted Tuesday that read, \u201cLet\u2019s fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters.\u201d The second photo, posted Wednesday, featured four lines written in alternating blue and black ink. \u201cAquamarine, Moonlit swimming pool, what if, All I need is you,\u201d the lines read. The third post, shared Thursday on Swift\u2019s story, read, \u201cI broke my own heart, Cause you were too polite to do it.\u201d Fans immediately took to social media to speculate about the meaning behind the cryptic posts from the \u201cMastermind\u201d singer. Theories circulating on X proposed that the handwritten notes Swift posted could be lyrics from the \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d vault tracks. On TikTok, a user speculated in a video, which has gotten over 600,000 views, that lines like \u201cAquamarine\u201d and \u201cMoonlit swimming pool\u201d could even be bonus song titles. When the album was released, it was revealed that the notes were in fact lyrics from the vault songs. The initial \u201c1989\u201d release had an intro that was penned by Swift when she was 24. The TV prologue features one handwritten message from Swift, as well as another two-page note typed in all-caps Courier. \"I was born in 1989, reinvented for The first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 wiTh The re-release of This album I love so dearly,\" she writes in the handwritten prologue. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine The magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.\" With the lengthier typed message, some fans zeroed in on one paragraph in particular, in which Swift writes, \"If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\" Factions of Swift\u2019s fan base have been known to clash online over speculation that the pop singer may have had romantic relationships with women, like her female friends. Swift herself said in 2019 that she is \u201cnot a part of\u201d the LGBTQ+ community. That hasn't stopped some fans \u2014 who call themselves \u201cGaylors\u201d \u2014 from overanalyzing all of her lyrics. Both notes end with \"It's been waiting for you,\" a line from her \"1989\" song \"Welcome To New York.\" Ahead of the release, Taylor Nation, the official account for Swift\u2019s management team, also shared a \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d album cover generator for fans to re-create the cover with their own photos. Fans posted their personalized covers, including versions featuring pictures of themselves and their pets. After the album dropped, many Swifties reminisced about reliving 2014 nostalgia in 2023 on posts on X and TikTok. \"The people who were in high school/older when 1989 came out\u2026. this album literally shaped our teens and 20s and it gets better with time nobody can tell me otherwise,\" one fan said in a X post. \"Getting to re-live all of our favorite albums with taylor for the second time is something so special to me... these albums are the soundtrack to our lives and it\u2019s so crazy to look back and see how far we have come since their original release,\" another fan posted. The reaction to the album online was largely enthusiastic, with many fans praising the vault tracks and the improvement of Swift's more mature vocals on the new version. However, the track \"Style (Taylor's Version)\" appeared to disappoint some fans. \"Oh god what is wrong with style tv... i\u2019m so sorry,\" one fan said in a post. \"STYLE TV WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU,\" said another fan. Some Swifties attributed this to a difference in the production on \"Style (Taylor\u2019s Version)\", which was not an exact recreation of the original version. Nonetheless, \"1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\" debuted with a perfect score of 100 on Metacritic. ",

        "content": "Players of the highly anticipated video game \u201cMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2\u201d took to social media to ask developers to correct a few scenes, which have confused the Puerto Rican and the Cuban flags in a game known to celebrate the main character's Puerto Rican heritage. The character, Miles Morales, is recognized by fans as one of the few Latino mainstream superheroes. When Insomniac Games released the new PlayStation 5 game featuring Morales last Friday, it included at least two scenes in which the Puerto Rican and Cuban flags were mixed up, which fans pointed out over the weekend. In one scene in Morales' Spanish Harlem family home, the flag displayed is not of his native Puerto Rico but of Cuba, social media users pointed out online. The Cuban flag appears a second time in a street scene. The Puerto Rican flag is correctly featured in other parts of the game, such as multiple spider suit designs, as well as some Puerto Rican traditions and dishes, according to IGN, a website that reviews video games. While the flags are designed similarly, with a single star inside a triangle and three colored stripes accompanied by two white stripes, their colors are inverted. The Cuban flag has a red triangle and three blue stripes, while the Puerto Rican flag has a blue triangle and three red stripes. Shortly after the game's release, James Stevenson, Insomniac Games' director of community and marketing director, said \"Fix is coming for that\" in response to a post from a user on \"X,\" who praised developers for representing Puerto Rican culture in the game while also requesting a fix to the mix-ups. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. As of Tuesday, no specific time for the fix had been provided and Insomniac Games did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. On Thursday, Insomniac Games put out a statement on X: \u201cToday\u2019s patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag. We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future. With more than 2.5 million copies sold in its first 24 hours, \u201cMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2\u201d broke the record as the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in a day, according to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which collaborated with Insomniac Games, PlayStation Studios and Marvel Games to create the game.

        "title": "Hasan Minhaj says New Yorker article made him look like a 'psycho'",
        "content": "Comedian Hasan Minhaj broke his silence on the New Yorker interview in which he admitted he embellished several of his stand-up stories, calling the article \u201cneedlessly misleading.\u201d In a 20-minute video \u2014 posted to his social media pages and YouTube channel on Thursday \u2014 Minhaj, 38, apologized to those who felt \u201cbetrayed or hurt\u201d by his stand-up. \u201cThe reason I feel horrible is because I\u2019m not a psycho, but this New Yorker article definitely makes me look like one,\u201d he said. The rest of the lengthy video is what Minhaj describes as a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into the \u201cscandal.\u201d He disputed some of the New Yorker\u2019s reporting and addressed three stories from the article: the anthrax scare he talked about in his 2022 Netflix special \u201cHasan Minhaj: The King\u2019s Jester\u201d; the FBI informant story he shared in the same special; and the prom anecdote from his 2017 special \u201cHasan Minhaj: Homecoming King.\u201d \u201cThe truth is, racism, FBI surveillance and threats to my family happened, and I said this on the record,\u201d he said. In \u201cHomecoming King,\u201d Minhaj said a white girl named \u201cBethany\u201d accepted his invitation to the prom but that her mom told him the night he showed up on her doorstep that she didn\u2019t want them to go together, expressing concern that their daughter would be seen in photos with someone brown. The New Yorker reported that \u201cBethany\u201d said she turned down Minhaj in person days before the event. Minhaj stood by his story, saying: \u201cBethany\u2019s mom did really say that. It was just a few days before prom. And I created the doorstep scene to drop the audience into the feeling of that moment, which I told the reporter.\u201d He also displayed screenshots of an alleged email exchange with \u201cBethany\u201d in which he had congratulated her on marrying a person of color. \u201cBethany\u201d allegedly wrote back, \u201cI think my parents have come a long way,\u201d which Minhaj said is an acknowledgement of her family\u2019s past racism. The New Yorker also touched on the \u201cKing\u2019s Jester\u201d special, in which Minhaj said an FBI informant he called \u201cBrother Eric\u201d infiltrated his mosque and harassed him when he was in high school. The publication reported Minhaj had fabricated a detail from the story in which he said he got slammed against the hood of a car by \u201cBrother Eric.\u201d Minhaj confirmed in his video Thursday that this did not happen to him. He said the anecdote was meant to spotlight the story of Hamid Hayat, a Muslim American man Minhaj\u2019s age who lost 14 years of his life to a wrongful conviction of terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, and whom Minhaj draws a parallel to during his special. \u201cThe truth is, I did have altercations with undercover law enforcement growing up. And that experience formed the basis of this story, but it didn\u2019t go down exactly like this,\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cSo I understand why people are upset. People face real danger at the hands of the police, and false stories can undermine real stories. And I am sorry, I added to that problem.\u201d In \u201cThe King's Jester,\u201d he recounts opening an envelope sent to his home that was filled with white powder, some of which he said spilled onto his young daughter. He said in the special that he and his wife rushed her to the hospital before finding out the powder was not actually anthrax \u2014 a detail he had told The New Yorker was an embellishment to the real story. Going forward, will I be more thoughtful about sticking to the facts in my storytelling? Absolutely. -HASAN MINHAJ, IN A VIDEO RESPONSE TO THE NEW YORKER ARTICLE While he said he\u2019s \u201csorry for embellishing the story,\u201d he said he did get sent a letter with white powder to his apartment in February 2019.  \u201cI opened it in the kitchen, powder fell on the table and my daughter was just a few feet away,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 10 seconds of freaking out, I realized it was not anthrax and that someone was f---ing with me.\u201d He said he created the hospital scene to immerse the audience in the same shock and fear he and his wife experienced after opening the powder-filled envelope, and that they had decided to keep the anthrax scare private at the time for fear of Netflix canceling his show. In an email statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for The New Yorker said the publication stands by its story. \u201cHasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOur piece, which includes Minhaj\u2019s perspective at length, was carefully reported and fact-checked.\u201d The article was based on interviews with more than 20 people, the spokesperson said, \u201cincluding former \u2018Patriot Act\u2019 and \u2018Daily Show\u2019 staffers; members of Minhaj\u2019s security team; and people who have been the subject of his standup work, including the former F.B.I. informant \u2018Brother Eric\u2019 and the woman at the center of his prom-rejection story. We stand by our story.\u201d The reporter behind the article also shared The New Yorker\u2019s statement in a post on the X social media platform, adding \u201cI stand by the story and encourage people to read it in full.\u201d A spokesperson for Minhaj did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. In the video, Minhaj said he decided to share his response now, amid the ongoing \u201cdevastating and hopeless\u201d news in the Middle East, because people have asked him if he\u2019s a \u201cliar\u201d and \u201cbeing accused of faking racism is not trivial.\u201d \u201cGoing forward, will I be more thoughtful about sticking to the facts in my storytelling? Absolutely,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cI have no problem with honest, good-faith critique, because I am always trying to improve as a performer and as a person. Look, the guy in this article is a proper \u2026 psycho. But I now hope you feel like the real me is not.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Michelle Williams' narration of Britney Spears' memoir goes viral",
        "content": "Readers of Britney Spears\u2019 memoir were expecting some vulnerable revelations \u2014 but nothing could\u2019ve prepared them for Michelle Williams\u2019 narration of the book. Clips of Williams reading \u201cThe Woman in Me\u201d have gone viral, with thousands of reshares online and a slew of calls for a Grammy nomination for the actor. People have been particularly enthralled by her impression of Justin Timberlake. In the book, Spears writes that NSYNC appeared to have distinguished itself from the Backstreet Boys, the band\u2019s main competition at the peak of their careers, by hanging out with Black artists and generally being a group of \u201cwhite boys [who] loved hip hop.\u201d \u201cSometimes, I think they tried too hard to fit in. One day, J and I were in New York going to parts of town I\u2019d never been to before. Walking our way was a guy with a huge blinged-out medallion. He was flanked by two giant security guards,\u201d Spears writes. \u201cJ got all excited and said so loud, \u2018Oh yeah, fo\u2019 shiz, fo\u2019 shiz. Ginuwine! What\u2019s up, homie?\u2019\u201d Users began sharing reactions to that particular sound bite on X, with some also making it meme on TikTok. \u201cnothing can prepare you for these 15 seconds of michelle williams doing a justin timberlake impression as written by britney spears,\u201d a user wrote on X, posting a clip of the audio recording. \u201c(white) Michelle Williams doing an impression of Britney doing an impression of Justin Timberlake doing an impression of a Black person \u2014 this is art,\u201d another person posted on X, calling for Williams to win an Oscar (which isn\u2019t possible, as audiobook narration isn\u2019t an eligible category). \u201cWhen I tell you I hollered when I heard Michelle Williams making fun of Justin Timberlake\u2019s Blaccent,\u201d a user said in a video. \u201cFirst of all, Britney, savage for putting that in the book. But hearing Michelle Williams read it, pure comedy.\u201d A popular thread on Reddit called Williams' Timberlake imitation \u201cuncanny.\" Some said they think Williams sounds exactly like Spears at times, making them forget it wasn\u2019t Spears narrating her own book. Some online also shared their appreciation for the accuracy with which Williams seemed to imitate Mariah Carey\u2019s speaking voice \u2014 a \u201cdeep, beautiful\u201d voice, according to Spears, who recounted her awe at meeting Carey and asking to take a photo with her. The sudden virality around Williams\u2019 narration also stirred some confusion, with many internet users claiming they had just found out she isn\u2019t the same Michelle Williams who was a member of the R&B girl group Destiny\u2019s Child.

        "title": "Why Britney Spears\u2019 memoir shows fans want to read more than just celebrity gossip",
        "content": "When Britney Spears shaved her head in 2007, the incident sparked widespread speculation over whether the pop star was experiencing a mental health break. The then-25-year-old checked into a rehab facility after the incident. Over a decade later, Spears revealed that the hair change was her \"F--- you\u201d to the world. \u201cEveryone thought it was hilarious. Look how crazy she is!\" she wrote in \u201cThe Woman in Me.\u201d \"Even my parents acted embarrassed by me. But nobody seemed to understand that I was simply out of my mind with grief. My children had been taken away from me.\u201d This is one of many revelations in Spears\u2019 memoir, which hit shelves Tuesday. The book, and the widespread buzz around it, has underscored how celebrity memoirs have become a vehicle for stars \u2014 especially women \u2014 to reclaim autonomy over their stories. While the genre has always had broad appeal, some experts and fans say its allure now extends beyond a demand for behind-the-scenes gossip.  \u201cCelebrity gossip gets very maligned as useless gossip, but it is a way to discuss human behavior,\u201d said Ashley Hamilton, 32, co-host of the podcast \u201cCelebrity Memoir Book Club.\u201d With Spears, for example, the prevailing public narrative around her was that she was a person who needed to be contained. Even her fans have taken Spears\u2019 social media behavior as evidence that she is erratic or in need of help. Spears was released from her conservatorship in 2021. Just last month, police did a wellness check at Spears\u2019 home after people made 911 calls citing an Instagram video she had up showing her dancing with fake knives. Spears clarified in a later post that the knives were fake and she was just trying to \u201cimitate\u201d fellow artist, Shakira.  \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that people talk about her that way,\u201d said Cat Hoggard Wagley, 30, a fan of Spears who posted her thoughts about the memoir on TikTok. \u201cThere are still people, not just celebrities, who are dealing with what she has dealt with in the mental health care industry.\u201d The late \u201990s and early 2000s, a time in which Spears made headlines almost daily, was a particularly unforgiving era for female stars, Wagley said, because gossip magazines appeared intent on humiliating these celebrities. Reading Spears\u2019 own words helped give Wagley an added perspective on how the era also shaped people who grew up consuming these headlines. \u201cWomen my age went through the culture that [Spears] did and at a different level we experienced the misogyny that she experienced,\u201d Wagley, who is a therapist based in Indiana, said. \u201cWhen someone goes out there and gets vulnerable, it gives people permission to get vulnerable with themselves,\u201d she added. Spears\u2019 book comes on the heels of the release of recent female celebrity memoirs by Jada Pinkett-Smith and Julia Fox. All three use their books to share how they felt controlled or  misunderstood in their interpersonal and professional lives. Fox\u2019s \u201cDown the Drain\u201d touches on her memories of a tumultuous childhood, her strained relationship with her parents and past experiences with drug abuse. \u201cCelebrity memoirs seem to prove over and over again that just because you see one side of a person doesn\u2019t mean you know someone,\u201d  said Hali Brown, 27, who posted about Fox\u2019s book on TikTok. Brown said she only ever heard Fox's name in reference to her past dating history with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t remember that celebrities are people,\" Brown said. \"And I think celebrity memoirs are a really good tool for actually just humanizing the people that you see on screens all the time.\u201d Claire Parker, co-host of the \u201cCelebrity Memoir Book Club\u201d podcast, said these days, the cultural gravity of the celebrity memoir is less about the \u201ctea\u201d hashed out, and more about how stars\u2019 experiences mirror that of their fans. Beyond grappling with adverse mental health, anguish, or loss, Parker said there is a frequent motif of personal joy and self-discovery across the memoirs penned by female celebrities. \u201cWe\u2019re 30 and we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, if you don\u2019t have it together by tomorrow. You\u2019ve missed the boat,\u201d she said. But, she said the women behind these stories are seemingly on the other side saying, \u201cYour life doesn\u2019t end at 32.\u2019\u201d Kristen McLean, a book industry analyst at Circana, a firm that tracks consumer behaviors and trends across industries, said the popularity of the genre stems from these books usually being both timely and relatable.  \u201c... and in the case of the highest-profile authors, [it\u2019s] a chance to tell their own story and control their own narrative in a 24/7 celebrity news cycle where they are often at the mercy of outside observers,\u201d McLean said in an email to NBC News. At the end of the day, readers like Brown said they are drawn to the fact that \u201ccelebrities are people.\u201d And that\u2019s the biggest draw of all.

        "content": "Korean girl group STAYC wore the wrong Rangers jersey during a show in Dallas, Texas, and the fashion faux pas did not go unnoticed on social media. During Thursday's show at the Factory in Deep Ellum, some of the members were supposed to wear Texas Rangers jerseys to represent the city's Major League Baseball team. Instead, they hit the stage in the uniforms of Rangers Football Club, a Scottish professional soccer club in Glasgow, Scotland. NBC News reached out to the group\u2019s agency Highup Entertainment for comment. Fans of the girl group took to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to share their reactions. Another person wrote: \"I admit my Scottish bias, but this story of the STAYC K-pop band reviving memories of 1990s Glasgow by accidentally wearing Rangers tops, has brought joy to my morning. And no, I\u2019m not a Rangers or a Celtic fan before anyone asks.\" \"The wrong Rangers = story of the year,\" another posted. \"STAYC really going viral for this lol. Might have to actually become a rangers fan now,\" one user said. Highup Entertainment acknowledged that the group had a \"bit of a mix-up,\" saying in a statement to Korea JoongAng Daily that the wrong uniforms were ordered before the Dallas show. \"We will be more cautious in the future,\" the agency said. STAYC, which stands for Star To A Young Culture, debuted in November 2020 and consists of members Sumin, Sieun, ISA, Seeun, Yoon, and J. Their agency describes them as the \"leader in creating 'Teen-fresh' genre that brings out the confidence of teenagers with a new vibe.\" They are currently on their first world tour.

It\u2019s a reaction that Neil Newbon, the actor behind the character, never anticipated.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely humbling,\u201d Newbon told NBC News in a recent Zoom interview. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make sure that I\u2019m OK all the time and keep my feet on the ground because the attention has been huge, and I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d While Larian Studios, the developer behind Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, gave Astarion quintessential heartthrob features, there\u2019s more than just sex appeal when it comes to the character. Many online who say they\u2019ve fallen for him also say they deeply identify with his story, which includes surviving trauma and sexual abuse.  For some fans, he\u2019s not just a hunky vampire \u2014 he\u2019s also a comfort character accurately portraying behaviors of those who live with trauma and stressor-related disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder.  \u201cIt is incredibly touching to have people come up to me and say, \u2018Astarion\u2019s story made me feel seen,\u2019 and that I was not prepared for \u2014 that was something, which was amazing and wild and beautiful,\u201d Newbon said. From Edward Cullen in the \u201cTwilight\u201d series to Brad Pitt\u2019s Louis de Pointe du Lac in the film \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d vampires have long been considered pop culture heartthrobs.  Fans say Astarion is different because they can have an active role in romancing him and choosing how his story plays out. In Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, players are given significant freedom in the way they interact with the companions who join them on the game\u2019s quest. This means they can also explore romantic relationships with those characters, which can change how the player and the characters interact over the course of the game.  Astarion might suggest a night of passion or outright dump the player depending upon how a person chooses to play the game. Players can also learn new things about the characters depending upon how they interact. Entire guides have been produced by outlets like IGN and Game Rant for the sole purpose of teaching players how to successfully romance Astarion. On social media, some fans have joked that they\u2019re playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 not for the plot or the combat, but as a dating simulator as they attempt to \u201cromance\u201d various members of their party. The game has a number of different endings that a player can achieve, which means many have played through several times in an attempt to see all the ways the relationships can play out.  And while there are a number of characters the player can romance \u2014 from the green Githyanki fighter Lae\u2019zel to the handsome warlock Wyll \u2014 it\u2019s clear Astarion has become the fan favorite.  On many \u201cFor You\u201d pages, Astarion has become a mainstay. In one video, a person shows themselves watching a fan edit of Astarion during a The 1975 concert. In another video, viewed more than 1.5 million times, Astarion simply stares into the camera while the band Sleep Token\u2019s song \u201cThe Summoning\u201d plays.  \u201cThese developers had NO business making him so hot,\u201d one commenter on TikTok wrote. \u201cHe makes me feel things I\u2019ve never felt before,\u201d another person wrote. Even some who have yet to play Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 have said they\u2019ve considered getting the game just to romance Astarion. \u201cI think a lot of a lot of people that go into this got into it the same way I did \u2014 I want to date the cute vampire man,\u201d said Alexis Elwood, 27, a Twitch streamer who has been romancing Astarion on her live streams. Elwood attributes some of the passion around Astarion to Newbon, citing both his performance and his interactions with fans.  Newbon, who was shortlisted this week for a Golden Joystick Award for his performance as Astarion, frequently livestreams himself playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 with friends on Twitch, which has created new lore and memes around the character. \u201cHe is, I think, equal in popularity to [actor] Pedro Pascal, even though he\u2019s not real.\u201d said Dawn Stronski, 43, a Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 player who also posts pop culture analysis to TikTok, of Astarion.  As the story unfolds, players learn that Astarion has escaped his malicious master Cazador Szarr. While a slave to Szarr, Astarion was forced to use his body and sexuality to lure in victims for Szarr to feed on. Szarr also inflicted brutal physical abuse on Astarion. It\u2019s because of this traumatic history that Astarion, in some playthroughs, uses his body to seduce others in order to gain protection or security. In some scenes involving sex, the game alludes to Astarion dissociating. In other instances he struggles to trust his companions.  These elements of his story have been crucial to Astarion\u2019s success, some fans said \u2014 especially those who have survived sexual trauma as well as those who live with disorders like PTSD. \u201cSo we come for the sex appeal, but we stay for the tragedy, right?\u201d Stronski, who said she grew up in a household with \u201cextreme\u2019\u2019 domestic violence, said. \u201cAs you listen to what [Astarion] has to say, you peel back this trope to find this harrowing tale of human trafficking, sexual assault and domestic violence \u2014 and it is heartbreaking to listen to because so many people have experienced these sorts of tragedies in their lives.\u201d Newbon and Larian Studios writer Stephen Rooney didn\u2019t want Astarion to be interpreted as simply the \u201ctraumatized\u201d character, Newbon said. They wanted him to be as complex and layered as a real person. Trauma was simply one part of his story, yet it informed many of his behaviors.  For example, Newbon explained that Astarion\u2019s theatricality and big personality is actually \u201cobfuscation. It\u2019s all a distraction. Because, actually, when you peel this back, there\u2019s quite a hot mess there and it\u2019s ugly and beautiful and fragile and desperately in need of love.\u201d  As someone affected by trauma, Newbon said he felt his performance was able to capture the realities and authenticity of surviving trauma. \u201cNow, having heard from so many survivors and talking to people, and realizing that not only did I feel right, but most importantly they feel this was right, it\u2019s a beautiful experience,\u201d Newbon said. \u201cIt really is and I feel very honored.\u201d  CORRECTION (Oct. 25, 2023, 6:58 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the video game Astarion appears in. It is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, not Baulder\u2019s Gate 3. Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York. ",

        "title": "Day of the Dead diapers, books? Actress Jessica Alba, Latina entrepreneurs team up",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 There are diapers with colorful displays of animals, cars and trains, Disney characters \u2014 so why not offer ones with the iconic skull image of \"La Catrina\" to celebrate the Mexican D\u00eda de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead? Actor Jessica Alba, co-founder of the Honest Company, which sells baby and family products, has teamed up with two fellow Mexican American entrepreneurs, Patty Rodriguez and Ariana Stein, the founders of Lil' Libros, a bilingual children's book company. The three have collaborated to commemorate the D\u00eda de los Muertos tradition, which originated in Mexico and is celebrated on Nov. 1 and 2. In interviews with Noticias Telemundo, they said diapers and books highlighting the Day of the Dead tradition are a way to celebrate Latino culture and identity, bilingualism, family and community. \u201cThis to me was a way to bring it forward and celebrate Lil\u2019 Libros, celebrate Honest and come together and create something really unique,\" said Alba, speaking of the products, including the books on La Catrina and D\u00eda de los Muertos, which are sold in the Honest Company website. \"We have the \u2018La Catrina\u2019 diaper, inspired by \u2018La Catrina: Emotions-Emociones' book, which is one of my son's favorites,\" Alba said. According to Rodriguez and Stein, their publishing company's goal was to create things and toys they didn't have when they were growing up. \u201cWhen I was pregnant with my first son 14 years ago, I started thinking about the way I wanted to raise him, as a madre (mother) Latina,\" Rodriguez said. \"Growing up, I always felt this feeling that we didn\u2019t belong. I was ashamed of my accent, my hair \u2014 and I think I carried that throughout my teenage years and my adulthood.\" \u201cWhen I was pregnant and became a mother,\" said Rodriguez, \"I was very adamant to make sure que mi hijo creciera (that my son grow up) proud of his identity, and his culture and his traditions \u2014 that\u2019s how the idea came out.\" \u201cI contacted many publishers, many said no and others said my idea didn\u2019t make sense,\" Rodriguez said. \"That was discouraging: those words are not new. We constantly have to prove ourselves in our own country.\" Then Rodriguez's house burned down and she said she understood there's a short time to create change \u2014 which is when she reached out to her friend Ariana Stein about publishing bilingual children's books. \u201cMy grandparents saw me start out as an actress in Hollywood,\u201d said Alba, a native of Pomona, California, whose paternal grandparents were the children of Mexican immigrants. \u201cI think they were proud that I always leaned on the community and broke stigmas and stereotypes that can be very oppressive in our culture,\" said the actor, known for her roles in movies such as \"Sin City,\" \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Spy Kids.\" \"I stand on their shoulders, I would not be here if they hadn\u2019t worked as hard as they did,\" Alba said of her grandparents. \u201cGiving back to the community is part of our business model.\" Since its inception, Honest has teamed up with the nonprofit Baby2Baby to make donations locally in Los Angeles and internationally. \"We have donated thousands of products to children living in poverty and experiencing homelessness,\u201d said Alba, \u201cwe do what we can for the community.\u201d Lil' Libros co-founder Ariana Stein said that in 2021 she and Rodriguez decided they were going to invite the community to invest in their company. \u201cWe wanted to include the community who has been helping us since Day One, and has supported us since the very beginning, that helped us build the brand and the mission,\" Stein said. \"Now we have over 5,000 investors and the majority of them are first-time investors. We are not only publishing books, we\u2019re teaching an entire generation that investing is important, that it\u2019s necessary if we want to create generational wealth and pass that on to our children.\u201d For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. In the beginning, though, \u201cwe did not have investors. All we had were all of our savings, which we used to publish our first three books,\" Stein said. \"What started as a passion project has become so much bigger than that; we have sold over 2.5 million books and we\u2019re really proud of it. We self-published in the beginning, now we have over 75 titles, we\u2019re publishing authors and illustrators, really making dreams come true.\u201d Alba, who has a daughter and a son, explained how she co-founded the Honest Company 15 years ago after her daughter Honor was born and she wanted cleaner and healthier baby products. \u201cI grew up with a lot of illnesses: I had chronic asthma and allergies, I was in the hospital a lot,\" Alba said. \"We are transparent about the ingredients that go inside, we always think about safety, the planet and try to use natural ingredients \u2014 also wanting beautiful design: why can\u2019t it be cute? We love color over here.\u201d \u201cWhen I discovered that Ariana and Patty had created Lil\u2019 Libros, I realized that it was the company I would have liked to have had when I became a mother,\u201d Alba said. \u201cThese books highlight the value of bilingualism in a beautiful way, they celebrate our culture. I have wanted to collaborate with Lil\u2019 Libros for years.\" Journalists Ana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Vickie Albanesi, Dalisa Robles and Marina Franco contributed to the story.

        "content": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are getting just a little bit more cozy in a new snap that has fans buzzing. Swift, who cheered on Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs at their Oct. 22 home game as they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 31-17, and she appeared to celebrate by planting a kiss on the NFL player\u2019s cheek.  Chariah Gordon, who\u2019s dating Kelce\u2019s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr., shared three photos with Swift on Instagram. Two of them capture Swift smiling, first posing with the whole group and the last with just Gordon. The second picture in the slideshow is what captured the internet\u2019s attention: Swift has her hand on Kelce\u2019s shoulder as she gives him a peck on the cheek. Next to them, Gordon and Hardman are cuddled up for the snap. \u201cThis upload just broke the internet,\u201d one social media user commented on the post.  Another wrote, \u201cWe love this! Gorgeous gorgeous girls and their men.\u201d  One Instagram user joked, \u201cAwwwww Taylor swift say that\u2019s her man now.\u201d  The photos quickly made their way to X, formerly known as Twitter, as multiple fan accounts shared the pictures.  \u201cShe looks so happy,\u201d one Swiftie tweeted.  Another very excited Swiftie repeatedly cheered, \u201cWE\u2019RE BACK IN THE CUTE COUPLE CANDIDS ERA.\u201d  The new pictures of the pair came a day after Swift arrived at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City wearing a red Chiefs sweatshirt and a gold friendship bracelet with Kelce\u2019s jersey number, 87. The friendship bracelet seemed to be a nod to the start of their rumored romance. On the July 26 episode of his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, Kelce said he attended one of Swift\u2019s concerts on her \u201cEras Tour\u201d and tried to give her a bracelet with his phone number on it.  Since then, the two have been dominating headlines as Swift has attended four Chiefs games this season and has been photographed grabbing dinner with Kelce in New York City.  ",

        "title": "Bad Bunny joined by actor Pedro Pascal in hilarious SNL mom skit",
        "content": "Bad Bunny got a little help from his friends during his first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hosting gig. \u201cSNL\u201d returned for another new episode of Season 49 on Saturday, Oct. 21, with Bad Bunny taking on double duty as host and musical guest. By his side throughout the night was actor Pedro Pascal, who hosted a fan favorite episode of \u201cSNL\u201d in February 2023. During the show, Pascal reprised one of his beloved characters in a sequel to the sketch \u201cProtective Mom.\u201d  In \u201cProtective Mom 2,\u201d Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez is prepping his girlfriend, newcomer Chloe Troast, to meet his aunt while his mom isn\u2019t home. Much like the original sketch, his aunt \u2014 portrayed by Bad Bunny \u2014 doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s girlfriend, at one point calling Troast \u201cvery Old Navy\u201d in Spanish. Hern\u00e1ndez tells Troast, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. She\u2019s just a little bit protective, but it\u2019s nothing compared to my mom.\u201d Like clockwork, Pascal enters the kitchen and hits Hern\u00e1ndez with a slipper before they embrace in a hug. Pascal gives Troast the same treatment as Bad Bunny, even tossing out the cookies she brought as a gift because they were not homemade. However, Pascal did save the tin the sweets came in, immediately sweeping yarn and thread into the container. Things go downhill when the group sits down for dinner and Troast tells Pascal and Bad Bunny that she works at her dad\u2019s non-profit, which causes Pascal to refer to her as a \u201cnepo baby.\u201d The insults continue with Bad Bunny saying Troast has a \u201cflat butt\u201d and looks like she\u2019d \u201cwork at Starbucks.\u201d  When Troast tries to share the good things she\u2019s done for Hern\u00e1ndez, including help him with his depression, Bad Bunny and Pascal both get defensive, with the \u201cLast of Us\u201d star yelling, \u201cMy son does not have depression! He just like the dark!\u201d Troast defends herself once more by proposing the group just eat dinner so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. When Hern\u00e1ndez says that he\u2019s lost his appetite, Troast replies, \u201cHow many times have I told you, you do not eat enough?,\u201d which causes Pascal and Bad Bunny to turn to one another and hold hands.  \u201cShe want to feed my son!\u201d Pascal coos.  Hern\u00e1ndez recently shared the back story behind the original \u201cProtective Mom\u201d sketch during his appearance on \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d Oct. 10.  The comedian told host Seth Meyers, \u201c[Pedro Pascal] came to the show and he kind of had this idea of wanting to do something in Spanish, and he wanted to be my mother\u2026and I was lucky enough to be the only person at the show that could write in Spanish.\u201d  Though Hern\u00e1ndez said that Pascal\u2019s character was \u201cnot physically\u201d based on his mother, there was one line in particular that inspired one of Pascal\u2019s lines from the original sketch \u2014 \u201cMy son don\u2019t have ADD, he just like to jump!\u201d Pascal made his first appearance of the night during Bad Bunny\u2019s monologue when the singer invited him on stage to translate. However, after claiming all he had said was, \u201cI\u2019m blessed to be here with my favorite actor, Pedro Pascal,\u201d Bad Bunny had him pivot to giving him advice on his monologue.  Pascal\u2019s advice, which was to make a self-depreciating joke about oneself, apparently did not apply to Bad Bunny. The \u201cTit\u00ed Me Pregunt\u00f3\u201d rapper said he wasn\u2019t able to share an anecdote about an \u201cunflattering\u201d part of his physical appearance because he didn\u2019t have any. He also couldn\u2019t seem to find an embarrassing photo of himself. As a last resort, Pascal had Bad Bunny tell the audience exactly what he wanted to say, which included expressing his gratitude for being at \u201cSNL,\u201d his thanks to fans for supporting him, and his appreciation to his family watching in Puerto Rico. Pascal also later returned to the stage to introduce Bad Bunny before he performed his song \u201cMonaco.\u201d ",

        "title": "People are divided online over whether it's gross to sleep on stained, yellowing pillows",
        "content": "\u201cYellow pillow\u201d discourse blew up overnight on X this weekend, appalling women across the platform and vindicating thousands of men who say they sleep better on the stained yellow pillows they\u2019ve kept for ages. Internet user Cam Thomson lit the fuse when he posted a photo of a crumpled yellow pillow to X, with corners darkened almost to brown and some areas that had faded back into white. The photo was taken from Getty Images, but he said his girlfriend was disgusted upon seeing how stained his own pillow was. Still, he insisted that his fellow men can attest to why \u201cthis thing is magic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the pillow is yellow and bestows upon me the most peaceful slumber,\u201d he wrote in a reply. His post racked up 55,000 likes in less than 24 hours, generating hundreds of replies and thousands of quote-posts adding to the debate over whether those pillows are truly comforting or just plain gross. He told NBC News that he\u2019s amused by the internet\u2019s response and that he was surprised people feel so strongly about the subject. He had owned the pillow for many years, he said, and switched out his pillowcase about once a year. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s my most comfortable pillow and a sign of a well-loved item,\u201d Thomson said, adding that his girlfriend had pushed him to finally retire it. \u201cI\u2019ve tucked it away into storage. I don\u2019t think I can bring myself to throw it out.\u201d Within the discourse has also emerged a clear gender divide, with mostly men claiming an emotional attachment to their yellow pillows and women questioning whether they know how to throw a pillow in the wash. \u201cPart of being a man is using the same pillow since the age of 10 and never washing it,\u201d a user wrote in a reply to Thomson\u2019s post. \u201cI got rid of my yellow pillows maybe a year ago and I legit haven\u2019t rested comfortably since,\u201d wrote another. \u201cThis is my most masculine trait I fear,\" another user posted. \"this is what keeps the he in my pronouns.\" A pillow tends to turn yellow over time as moisture collects on its surface, likely from sweat, oil, drool and wet hair. That can lead to a buildup of pore-clogging bacteria, as well as allergens such as dust and mildew, according to the Sleep Foundation, a sleep research organization, which recommends using a pillow protector or a higher-quality pillowcase to prevent discoloration. One popular post in response to the discussion warns women to leave if they see one of those pillows at a man\u2019s house, calling it the \u201cbiggest acne breakout you will ever have in your life.\u201d \u201cI beg men to buy new pillows. I have never dated a man who DIDNT have at least one\u201d yellow pillow, another user posted. \u201cA pillow case even. A pillow protector. Please.\u201d Though Thomson\u2019s X post reignited the contentious split in opinion, \u201cyellow pillow\u201d discourse isn\u2019t entirely new to the internet. Less than two months ago, an internet user looked to Reddit to find community among fellow yellow pillow appreciators \u2014 without much success. Under a July Reddit post from a user lamenting about their dad\u2019s refusal to replace his yellowed pillows, a commenter wrote: \u201cYou will never understand the bond between a man and his yellow pillow.\u201d And on TikTok, women began calling out the phenomenon more than a year ago. Despite the facetious internet outrage, the conversation has united men around the world to take communal pride in their yellow pillows. So, for as long as it\u2019s permitted, it seems those old, flat emotional (and neck?) support pillows are here to stay. Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "He went missing after a manic episode. Now TikTok's 'Uncle Chris' is sharing what really happened.",
        "content": "Months after his disappearance, TikToker Christopher Rooney \u2014 known as \"Uncle Chris\" to his millions of followers \u2014 is opening up about his manic episode in hopes of using his platform to raise awareness about mental health. Rooney, 26, rose to prominence in 2020 with the TikTok account theyeetbaby, which features comedic videos of him with his niece and nephew. Since then, they have grown a fan base of 5.7 million followers. But in July, the Richmond, Virginia-based creator made headlines after he went missing for nine days, alarming many of his followers. He later checked into an inpatient program at a mental health facility. Doctors diagnosed him with bipolar I disorder. This week, he publicly addressed what happened in full.  \u201cHere is the story about how I went missing and ended up in the psych ward for 17 days,\u201d he said in a TikTok video uploaded Tuesday, which has since received more than 5 million views and an outpouring of supportive comments. Rooney is not the first creator to get candid about his mental health struggles \u2014 but he hopes going public with his experience will encourage his followers to learn and share more information about bipolar I. He said some fans learned what a manic episode was through his journey. The experience has also allowed him to be more \u201chimself,\u201d after primarily being known as wholesome \u201cUncle Chris\u201d online. \u201cI still want to keep going on with our Yeet Baby page and everything,\u201d Rooney said in an interview with NBC News this week. \u201cBut now I see that my posts can help people if their family members or they are going through something themselves. So I definitely want to continue on this road and spread awareness and help in any way I can in the mental health world.\u201d Bipolar I disorder is characterized by prolonged manic episodes or severe manic symptoms \u2014 described as \u201cextremely \u2018up,\u2019 elated, irritable, or energized behavior\u201d \u2014 that require immediate medical attention, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.  Rooney said doctors told him that his manic episode had been induced by trauma he had recently experienced in his personal life. He had been struggling after he and his wife, a creator who is now private on TikTok, suffered two miscarriages and decided to get a divorce.  He said he was manic for around 30 days, during which he went \u201coff the rails\u201d at a casino, donated $20,000 to anti-child trafficking organizations after watching the movie \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d and destroyed all of his belongings. Eventually, he went on a drive and threw items out of his car to try to get the attention of police officers. \u201cI basically was begging for help. I knew something was wrong,\u201d he said. During this time, Rooney posted several videos, which prompted speculation about his marriage from followers. He said people were making assumptions that others started to believe, which exacerbated his mental state. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple perspectives given that were just completely false about what\u2019s going on in my personal life, and it\u2019s frustrating to see,\u201d he said.  The videos showed a different side of Rooney that followers didn\u2019t expect. He hadn\u2019t shared a lot about his personal life in the past. \u201cI had and have a life outside of [theyeetbaby],\u201d he said. \u201cI never really showed it before. That was a big thing. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, casino and drinking.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I hate to break it to you guys. I get to stay here for free because I\u2019ve done this before.\u2019\u201d After three years as a creator, he said he\u2019s mostly unbothered by comments from followers. He just wished people understood that \u201cno one knows what anyone\u2019s going through.\u201d Now, Rooney said that he feels like he can share a bit more of himself and his personality online. As he\u2019s been posting videos about his experience, symptoms and recovery, fans have left encouraging messages.  \u201cYour heart is always in the right place Chris. Wishing you the best and happy to see you are doing so well,\u201d one commenter wrote.  \u201cYou have no idea how much you are helping people. Mental health is important and YOU are important,\u201d another wrote.  Rooney has since started an intensive outpatient program.

        "title": "YouTube demonetizes prominent creator Sssniperwolf\u2019s channel following accusations of doxxing fellow creator",
        "content": "YouTube on Friday said it was issuing a temporary monetization suspension to creator Alia Shelesh, known as SSSniperwolf on the platform, after allegations that she doxxed fellow creator Jack Douglass.  The news comes after an internet feud between Shelesh and Douglass escalated last weekend in an incident that Douglass described as making him fear for his safety. Douglass, who goes by Jacksfilms on YouTube, has been vocal about his criticism of SSSniperwolf \u2014 claiming in a recent video that Shelesh uses viral content from TikTok without gaining explicit permission from or giving credit to the original creators. Douglass has also mocked her videos on his parody channel JJJacksfilms. Shelesh has denied accusations of copying others \u2014 writing in a June post on X that \u201c90% of what I upload are my ideas.\u201d Douglass, who has almost 5 million subscribers on YouTube, said that on Saturday, Shelesh showed up at his home, posted an Instagram story and tagged his account. In Shelesh\u2019s Instagram story, which NBC News reviewed before it was removed, she wrote \u201clet\u2019s talk like adults.\u201d It was shared to her more than 5 million Instagram followers.  In response, Douglass posted to X about the \u201ccreepy, gross, violating\u201d behavior, and called on YouTube to demonetize Shelesh or remove her from the platform altogether. Shelesh initially defended herself against Douglass\u2019 accusations. \u201cI have no idea how to Dox,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram story, adding that Douglass had \u201cbeen harassing me for months then plays victim.\u201d In the wake of the incident, creators online expressed renewed concern over how platforms should respond when digital disputes cross the line into real-life danger. Some criticized YouTube, claiming they were allegedly protecting Shelesh. Others urged their followers to keep \u201cspamming\u201d YouTube with complaints against Shelesh.  Much of the criticism centered around concerns that doxxing, the sharing of personal information online without consent, can lead to more serious acts like swatting, which is when someone falsifies a police report in order to have authorities show up at someone\u2019s home. Swatting can be at best humiliating and at worst lethal. It\u2019s become a concern across many social media platforms, including Twitch. Neither Douglass nor Shelesh responded to requests for comment. Shelesh on Friday issued an apology in a post on X, writing that her recent actions are \u201cinexcusable.\u201d She addressed Douglass directly, saying she would reach out to him so they could \u201cconnect and communicate respectfully.\u201d \u201cJacksfilm, while we certainly don\u2019t see eye to eye and have our differences, I am sorry for reacting the way I did when I should\u2019ve taken the opportunity to show young creators how adults and professionals resolve conflict by communicating directly, respectfully, and privately; not for views or content, but a meaningful example of how conflict should be solved,\u201d she wrote.  She thanked YouTube for what she described as holding her accountable by temporarily demonetizing her platform. \u201cI deserve it, respect the decision and appreciate the opportunity to learn and grow from a true lapse in judgement,\u201d she wrote.  YouTube did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  In its post on X responding to the initial criticism on Friday, the platform cited its Creator Responsibility policies, which state creators \u201cshould remain responsible both on and off the platform. If we see that a creator\u2019s on- and/or off-platform behavior harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we may take action to protect the community.\u201d \u201cOff platform actions that put others\u2019 personal safety at risk harm our community & the behavior on both sides isn\u2019t what we want on YT,\u201d YouTube wrote in the post on X. \u201cHoping everyone helps move this convo to a better place.\u201d Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "content": "If you're striking with SAG-AFTRA, make sure your Halloween character costume isn\u2019t out of character. The actors union warned its thousands of members not to dress up as characters of struck content this trick-or-treat season. On Wednesday, SAG-AFTRA issued new guidance for \"strike-friendly\" Halloween costumes, advising its members to dress up as generalized characters \u2014 such as zombies and spiders \u2014 over specific characters featured in content from companies the union is striking against. \"Let's use our collective power to send a loud and clear message to our struck employers that we will not promote their content without a fair contract,\" the release said. The union's guidance also asks members to refrain from posting photos of costumes inspired by struck content on social media platforms. However, characters from non-struck content \u2014 such as animated TV shows \u2014 are okay to go, per the release. This means costume ideas from major box office hits from this year, like \"Barbie\" or \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" could cross the picket line. In a statement, a spokesperson for SAG-AFTRA noted the guidance was in response to questions from members on how to support the ongoing strike through Halloween festivities. \u201cThis was meant to help them avoid promoting struck work, and it is the latest in a series of guidelines we have issued,\u201d a spokesperson for the actors union said in a statement. \u201cIt does not apply to anyone\u2019s kids. ... Our number one priority remains getting the studios back to the negotiating table so we can get a fair deal for our members, and finally put our industry back to work.\u201d  Despite the SAG-AFTRA advice, dressing up as iconic film and TV characters will stay popular this year. Among the top searches for costumes this past week are \"Daredevil,\" \"Princess Diaries\" and \"Monster High,\" according to Google Trends. Popular partner costumes include a number of fan favorites, too: \"Ross and Rachel\" and \"Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole\" are among the contenders, according to the search engine. Meanwhile, negotiations between Hollywood studios and SAG-AFTRA were suspended last week. The union has been on strike since July 14. Representatives for the AMPTP, the motion pictures trade association, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The AMPTP represents NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News. Inyoung Choi is an associate producer for NBC News. ",

        "content": "Bad Bunny announced a three-month touring plan Thursday, just days after recent release of his new album, \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana.\u201d The Puerto Rican rapper and singer-songwriter billed the tour as the \"Most Wanted Tour\" and is set to visit 37 major cities across North America from Feb. 21 to May 26. The poster promoting the tour includes the phrases \"solamente trap\" (\"only trap\") and \"If you're not / A real fan / Don't come.\" The announcement comes as he is slated to appear Thursday night on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d \u2014 for the fifth time \u2014 and this weekend on Saturday Night Live as both a host and performer. A promo video for SNL featured the rapper and singer as a wrestler squaring off against the week\u2019s musical guest, himself. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

        "title": "Viral TikTok underscores the need for frank conversations about STIs",
        "content": "Sophie Miller felt like she had no one to talk to after she was diagnosed with herpes last week \u2014 so she turned to TikTok.  In a candid video posted to her secondary \u201cburner\u201d account on Oct. 11, Miller, 21, who lives in Detroit, stitched together video to document her experience of the process. The video starts with her describing her symptoms \u2014 a burning sensation after urinating, a swollen lymph node in her groin, sores on her genitals \u2014 before she went to the doctor. Then she describes her anxiety ahead of the appointment and finally cries on camera as she shares the news of her diagnosis.   The response was overwhelming \u2014 more than 7.2 million people had seen the video as of Wednesday afternoon. Many commenters shared their own stories in solidarity. Other people expressed gratitude for Miller\u2019s openness, given the embarrassment they\u2019d felt after their diagnoses.  \u201cI\u2019ve had so many people reaching out to me and telling me their stories and thanking me,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd I just was not expecting that. \u2026 It\u2019s just been very helpful for me and I\u2019m sure for others who have just been diagnosed, as well as diagnosed in the past.\u201d The popularity of Miller\u2019s video suggests a demand for frank conversations about sexually transmitted infections online, particularly from sexual health advocates and people living with viruses like herpes. In recent years, TikTok has become a place for many health educators  \u2014 from doctors to sex therapists \u2014 to facilitate more positive conversations around sex. Talking about sexually transmitted diseases and infections can help reduce stigma and increase awareness, some experts say.   A spokesperson for TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the brave people who get out there in front and just say \u2018I\u2019m going to talk about this\u2019 who break down those barriers and those stigmas,\u201d said Dr. Keith Jerome, a virologist who researches herpes at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.  Speaking out about one\u2019s experience with the virus can open the door for others to do so, too, he added, and a critical mass of voices can then put pressure on governments and health organizations to fund research. Herpes is both common and treatable. More than 3.7 billion people worldwide under age 50 have herpes simplex virus type 1, the virus Miller was diagnosed with, according to the World Health Organization. That\u2019s roughly 67% of the population in that age group. Another 491 million people ages 15 to 49 have HSV-type 2, which mainly causes genital herpes, WHO data shows. \u201cSilence around the topic and avoiding testing harms both physical, mental and emotional health,\u201d Planned Parenthood says in a blog post. That\u2019s in part why Miller decided to go public. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to talk to strangers on a screen than in person or talking to your friends about it,\u201d she said.  Miller said the comments on her video comforted her \u2014 and educated her further. Some of her followers who also have herpes shared steps she can take to reduce her transmission rate. Others just offered support.  \u201cHey girl.. I was diagnosed 8 years ago at the ripe age of 18 -thought my life was over, but that\u2019s not the case. Reach out if you ever need to talk,\u201d a commenter wrote. Another wrote: \u201cI have herpes as well and I was terrified. I didn\u2019t know what it would mean moving forward. I\u2019ve had it about 4 years and only had a few outbreaks.\u201d Miller said she hopes to see more open conversations about sexual health so others who are struggling with a diagnosis know they\u2019re not alone.  \u201cI have an STD,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t feel like the end of the world.\u201d Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "title": "Who's the media pioneer featured on Google Doodle?",
        "content": "Google Doodle is marking on Tuesday the life and legacy of Raoul A. Cortez, a pioneer of Spanish-language radio and broadcasting in the U.S. and a civil rights activist, on what would have been his 118th birthday. Cortez, who was Mexican American, founded the first Spanish-language radio station as well as the first TV station aimed at Hispanics. Guest artist Rafael Lopez, who is also Mexican American, aimed to depict \"the various roles Cortez played in furthering Latino culture and civil rights in the U.S.,\" according to the Doodle. Cortez was born on Oct. 17, 1905 in Veracruz, Mexico, and his family immigrated to San Antonio, Texas, when he was young. In 1946, he founded KCOR-AM, the country's first fully Spanish-language radio station owned and operated by a Latino, as the San Antonio Radio Hall of Fame noted. It launched with the slogan \"La Voz Mexicana\" (\"The Mexican Voice\"). According to the National Museum of American History, in order to get Federal Communication Commission approval despite World War II-era restrictions on non-English radio \u2014 the government feared it could spread seditious messages \u2014 Cortez argued that the radio station could be a tool to mobilize support for the U.S. war effort among Spanish-language speakers. Later, seeing a dearth in television aimed at Hispanics, Cortez founded KCOR-TV Channel 41 in 1955. It was similarly the first Latino-run Spanish-language broadcast in the U.S. Cortez was also an ardent civil rights activist and leader in the Mexican American community in Texas. As one of the directors of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), he oversaw the Delgado v. Bastrop Independent School District case, which successfully ended the segregation of Mexican Americans in Texas public schools. He also had an instrumental role in the Bracero Program, meeting with U.S. and Mexican presidents to help facilitate the movement of Mexican farmworkers between the U.S. and Mexico on short-term work contracts to stem the lack of laborers during World War II. Lopez, the artist of the Doodle, said he was inspired by Aztec symbolism in KCOR-AM's branding in designing the Doodle. \"I came across a modern Aztec mask that became a distinct symbol for KCOR broadcasting in San Antonio. It became a powerful symbol of the station's close ties to the Mexican American community,\" Lopez told Google. \"Inspired by this mask, I used an Aztec motif, geometric triangle patterns to acknowledge the vision and influence of Cortez\u2019s truly pioneering work for Mexican Americans.\" Emi Tuyetnhi Tran is an intern for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "Maren Morris files for divorce from Ryan Hurd after 5 years of marriage",
        "content": "Country music singer-songwriters Maren Morris and Ryan Hurd are calling it quits after five years of marriage. Morris, who originally tied the knot with Hurd in March 2018, filed for divorce on Oct. 2 in Tennessee. She cited \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as the reason for the split. Court records from Davidson County show Morris said the two were living together until the day of filing, along with their 3-year-old son, Hayes. In her filing, Morris asked for their prenuptial agreement to be enforced and for joint custody of their son. Morris, who welcomed her only son on March 23, 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, has been open about her ups and downs over the years. In a Sunday Sitdown with TODAY\u2019s Willie Geist, she revealed that after Hayes was born, Morris said she began to experience postpartum depression. \u201cI think a lot of identity crises happened there,\u201d she told Willie in an interview that aired on Dec. 4, 2022. She added that everything seemed to converge at once. \u201cNot just being a new parent and a new mother and dealing with postpartum depression for the first time, and reeling from that, and trying to like find the forest through the trees. But also just knowing my worth without someone clapping for me,\u201d she said. Morris went on to say that while she and Hurd were still writing music during that time, much of it was very sad. She said her then-husband helped pull her out of her \u201cpandemic doldrum.\u201d \u201cHe kind of just helped me in song form, and in just conversation form, figure out how to get to the light,\u201d she said. Since then, the singer spoke out about plastic surgery and the unrealistic expectations placed on women to bounce back after giving birth.  She also recently announced she is taking a \u201cstep back\u201d from country music. In an interview on The New York Times \u201cPopcast\u201d podcast published on Oct. 4, Morris said she had realized she was in a \u201ctoxic\u201d environment, working in the industry in Nashville. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say goodbye, but I really cannot participate in the really toxic arms of this institution anymore,\u201d she said, adding that she love Nashville in general, just not certain factions. \u201cWe have amazing songwriters (in Nashville), so that\u2019s not going to change. But I couldn\u2019t do this, like, sort of circus anymore of feeling like I have to absorb and explain people\u2019s bad behaviors and laugh it off. I just couldn\u2019t do that after 2020, particularly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve changed. A lot of things changed about me that year.\u201d  She added that she\u2019s just \u201cdoing my own thing\u201d these days and has asked her team not to submit her work for country music awards shows going forward. \u201cI\u2019m not shutting off fans of country music. That\u2019s not my intention\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the music industry that I have to walk away \u2014 a few factions \u2014 from.\u201d Diana Dasrath is entertainment producer and senior reporter for NBC News covering all platforms.

        "content": "Taylor Swift can add box office record holder to her list of accolades. The pop superstar, who sold out stadiums around the country, is now dominating the box office with her concert film, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\" The movie amassed $92.8 million during its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-grossing domestic concert film ever, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks box office earnings. That means it surpassed the $73 million run of \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d in 2011. Fans flocked to theaters during the weekend ready to live \u2014 or relive \u2014 the almost three-hour concert experience, picking up Eras Tour popcorn buckets and trading friendship bracelets with strangers. Many decked out in themed outfits ranging from casual merch to full-out bedazzled bodysuits. Viewers shared videos on social media of their fellow attendees screaming, dancing and waving along to Swift\u2019s lyrics. A crowd often massed at the front of the theater, standing as if they had floor seats at the Eras Tour. One viewer witnessed the film turn into a dance party for a theater full of young children. Some also commented that they were able to hear the singing even as they sat watching \u201cThe Nun II\u201d or \u201cThe Exorcist: Believer\u201d in another theater \u2014 infusing truth into a long-running joke that emerged almost as soon as Swift announced the film\u2019s release. The hype was so intense in many theaters that some filmgoers appeared put off by disruptive behavior, sharing in posts online that they felt audience members drowned out Swift\u2019s voice and shined flashlights that obstructed the screen. Still, many others pointed out that Swift had encouraged treating the film like a concert. Distributor AMC Theatres had also encouraged dancing and singing at the show, although its guidelines for the film asked attendees not to dance on seats or block others\u2019 view. Eli Countryman, 25, went to see the concert film two nights in a row upon its release in theaters. He attended opening night at the Grove mall Thursday in Los Angeles, less than 24 hours after Swift had walked the red carpet there at the film\u2019s premiere. \u201cI spend all my money on Taylor Swift anyways,\u201d he said, three friendship bracelets on his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m excited because we\u2019re going to one of the bigger screenings just to see it in HD.\u201d Others at the Grove\u2019s opening showing also said they wanted to appreciate the choreography of Swift\u2019s routines up close. Heather Conway, 27, had attended the Eras Tour earlier this year and said she was excited to experience it anew. \u201cShe really puts on a show, you know?\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd all her fans are always so nice and welcoming with each other.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "content": "Britney Spears says she had an abortion after getting pregnant with Justin Timberlake, a revelation from an excerpt of the pop star's upcoming memoir published Tuesday by People magazine. \u201cJustin definitely wasn\u2019t happy about the pregnancy,\u201d Spears wrote about her pregnancy with then 18-year-old Timberlake in her memoir. \u201cHe said we weren\u2019t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.\u201d Spears was 17 when she started dating Timberlake in 1999, and the pair were together until 2002. In her memoir, \"The Woman in Me,\" the 41-year-old singer describes meeting Timberlake when she was 11 on the set of 'The Mickey Mouse Club,\" and her first kiss with him during a game of Truth or Dare. Representatives for Spears and Timberlake did not immediately respond to NBC News requests for comment. \"The Woman in Me\" will be released Oct. 24. The title comes from Spears' reflections on her \"soul-crushing\" 13-year conservatorship under her father James \u201cJamie\u201d Spears. In addition to taking away her power to make her own medical and financial decisions, Spears said it \"stripped her of her womanhood.\" \u201cThe woman in me was pushed down for a long time,\u201d Spears wrote in the excerpts published by People. \u201cThey wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time.\u201d Spears also gives insight behind the open court testimony she made against her father in June 2021, writing that her father often told her she looked fat, infantilized her and became the \"death\" to her creativity as an artist. Caught in a world that did not allow her to be an adult, Spears said she acted like a little girl in response. She was first put under conservatorship in 2008 after she had a public breakdown and was placed under psychiatric holds. In her memoir, Spears said shaving her head and acting out were her ways of pushing back against a childhood where she was told what others thought of her body at every turn. Spears\u2019 memoir also describes brief periods of teenage normalcy during her childhood in Kentwood, Louisiana, which took place in between her star performances. \"Already within me was a push-pull: part of me wanted to keep building toward the dream; the other part wanted me to live a normal life in Louisiana. For a minute, I had to let normalcy win,\" wrote Spears. At 15, she signed a record deal with Jive Records, and released record-smashing albums \"Baby One More Time\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again.\" Spears' memoir details her thoughts behind iconic moments in her career, like when she performed 'I'm a Slave 4 U' at the 2001 VMAs using a snake as a prop. She also describes acting in the 2002 coming-of-age film \"Crossroads,\" and her struggles separating herself from the characters she played on-screen. \"Living that way, being half yourself and half a fictional character, is messed up,\" Spears wrote. \"After a while you don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore.\" Spears' conservatorship was officially terminated in November, 2021. In her memoir, she said her new found freedom meant she's had to construct a whole different identity for herself as a confident woman instead of as a passive girl.

        "content": "In the past, the word \u201csassy\u201d has been used as a dig toward expressive men online \u2014 but one TikTok creator is turning the descriptor into a badge of honor. Prayag Mishra, 25, has charmed TikTok users with his expressive mannerisms, quippy attitude and playful dancing over the past three weeks. In that time, he has grown his following from 29,000 to 2.5 million \u201cpookie bears\u201d \u2014 the pet name for his fans. As his star continues to rise, he has become the face of \u201csassy men\u201d on the app. \u201cSassy men\u201d have been a divisive topic on social media over the past year. First coined on X in 2022, according to online meme database Know Your Meme, the \u201csassy man apocalypse\u201d has been used to describe the prominence of expressive men with bigger attitudes, which some have deemed \u201cfeminine.\u201d Initially, \u201csassy\u201d was typically used in a derogatory or homophobic manner. Viewers would call male TikTok creators \u201csassy\u201d if they seemed too effeminate. But when \u201csassy man apocalypse\u201d TikToks \u2014 or videos of girlfriends showing their boyfriends\u2019 mannerisms \u2014 started to trend over the summer, the online sentiment shifted. While some videos under the trend were critical of sassy men, others portrayed sassiness as endearing and the opposite of toxic masculinity. \u201cAll the perfect ingredients of the sassy man apocalypse had been brought together,\" Mishra, who has been making content for two years, said in an interview. \"I\u2019m just here to push it even further. I\u2019m on the front lines of the sassy man apocalypse.\" Last month, Mishra said he decided to be \"radically authentic\" in his online presence. The creator, based in Toronto, Canada, posts many of his videos from his car. His authenticity has paid off \u2014 Mishra has become a meme with his snappy one-liners, and is considered a heartthrob to his predominantly female fanbase.  At first, Mishra didn\u2019t know what to make of viewers calling him \u201csassy.\u201d But he has since embraced the descriptor. He said he was raised by strong women, which shaped his humor and personality.  \u201cThis is who I am,\" Mishra said. \"This is the way that I express myself. I wasn\u2019t expecting unanimous love. I wasn\u2019t expecting support from people. I was expecting, you know, people to roast me and make fun of me.\" TikTok creator Ferlynn Petit-Bell, 23, has been critical of videos that shame men for expressing their feelings. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to be a feminist and you\u2019re trying to combat toxic masculinity, that\u2019s not going to happen if you\u2019re shaming men for having anything else besides stoicism or nonchalant attitudes towards different situations,\u201d said Petit-Bell, who said it\u2019s it has been exhausting to see the rise of divisive influencers like Andrew Tate in the past few years. But she\u2019s been encouraged by creators like Mishra \u2014 of whom she\u2019s a fan \u2014 who appear sensitive and expressive. \u201cIt\u2019s very refreshing to see men who are not so obsessed with appearing hypermasculine or hyperstoic,\u201d she said. Others seem to agree: Her Sept. 27 video sharing her love for sassy men received over 500,000 views. Before Mishra dominated TikTok feeds, Iyosias Wondwossen, 24, was described as one of the \u201cOG sassy men\u201d by some. Known for his attitude and sense of humor, he said his followers have been calling him \u201csassy\u201d for almost a year.  Wondwossen takes the descriptor as a positive thing, although he said that it\u2019s been used as an insult toward him in the past. Over the past month, Wondwossen said it's been interesting to see the shift in attitudes toward sassy men, particularly as Mishra has grown in popularity.  \u201cI\u2019ve seen people just complain in general about sassy men and the sassy man apocalypse in this era that we\u2019re in and how we need to get back to manly men and stuff \u2026 this moment that he's [Mishra] created is really cool to see,\u201d Wondwossen said. The fact that men have built a world where we have to be super masculine isn\u2019t really going to change all too much just because of this minor sassy movement. -IYOSIAS WONDWOSSEN, DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE INTERNET'S 'OG SASSY MEN' While Wondwossen said TikTok is making the concept of leaning in to your sassiness as a man more acceptable, he said that it isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection of real social change.  \u201cThe fact that men have built a world where we have to be super masculine isn\u2019t really going to change all too much just because of this minor sassy movement,\u201d he said.  Brandon Harris, an assistant professor of communication at University of Houston-Clear Lake who has studied toxic masculinity among online creators, agreed with this sentiment.  While sassy men can open a dialogue into broader conversations about toxic masculinity, he said people shouldn\u2019t expect Mishra or any single creator to be the solution to this issue.  Mishra is \"branding himself as someone who is challenging masculinity. So great, we need people who are going to do that,\" Harris said. \"But that is a big ask. And that is going to ultimately require some significant actions that are going to require more than, you know, a TikTok video from your vehicle.\" Ultimately, Harris cautioned against putting anyone on a pedestal without them having put in actual work of dismantling patriarchal norms. \u201cIf you actually want to redefine the boundaries of masculinity in a healthy way, you\u2019re gonna have to talk about it,\" he said. \"So these negotiations need to happen. But we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that this can very easily be turned into a tool to maintain the status quo.\" Still, Mishra said he hopes to build a community based on positivity. A self-described romantic, Mishra said he\u2019s \u201cmarried\u201d to his pookie bears. He loves that his audience speaks a \u201clanguage of love\u201d with him and each other.  \u201cAs a man, we\u2019ve just seen a lot of, like, not the best role models on the internet,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cAnd we need a man that\u2019s more loving, that\u2019s more positive, that\u2019s more caring. I just think that everything happened at the right time, at the right place, for the right people to perceive it.\u201d Daysia Tolentino is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Robin Williams' voice returns as Genie from 'Aladdin' in new Disney short \u2014 without AI",
        "content": "It took a village of creatives at Disney Animation to pull off \u201cOnce Upon a Studio,\u201d the animated short that celebrates 100 years of stories and magic. Iconic characters like Snow White and Peter Pan feature alongside Robin Williams\u2019 Genie in a cast of 543 characters from more than 85 feature-length and short films. And it all came together without any artificial intelligence involved. Directors Dan Abraham and Trent Correy were seeking a way to honor the studio\u2019s legacy. \u201cOnce Upon a Studio\u201d takes place at the end of a work day at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank. The studio becomes a magical place once Disney Legend Burny Mattinson, who worked there for 70 years on films such as \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d (1955) and \u201cOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\u201d (1961), leaves. Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse step out of a photo and call for their friends to gather for an official 100th Anniversary Studio portrait. Abraham and Correy met over eight months to pull the project off. Shrouded in secrecy, a group of artists, led by Eric Goldberg and Andrew Feliciano, worked to bring characters such as Snow White, Genie, Ariel, Belle, Peter Pan, Wendy and even Chernabog to life. Eighty percent of the characters were hand-drawn while the others were computer-generated. Abraham and Correy wanted each character to look like they had just stepped out of their movie. Producer Bradford Simonsen explains, \u201cIt needed to feel that so the audience response would be visceral. We used our animation research library where we pulled out model sheets for the animators to work from. We had Eric Goldberg who has the studio history, and we did tests to make sure it was all working together in the scenes.\u201d The team of heavy-hitter animators included James Baxter (Belle, \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d), Nik Ranieri (\u201cThe Lion King\u201d) and Ruben Aquino, who animated the final designs for Ursula in 1989. Says Abraham, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t drawn her in over 30 years, and he came out of retirement to do Ursula for us.\u201d Others simply wanted to be a part of this historic short. With thousands of characters to pick from, the directors had a wish-fulfillment list of who they wanted to be featured. Chernabog from Disney\u2019s 1940 film \u201cFantasia\u201d was top of Correy\u2019s wishlist. But there was a slight problem. \u201cHe\u2019s the size of a mountain and he couldn\u2019t fit into the building,\u201d says Correy. It was Abraham who came up with the idea of the \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d pups watching \u201cFantasia\u201d on TV. Disney CG animator Jorge Ruiz expressed interest in animating the character. Correy says, \u201cHe reached out and said how when he was growing up in Venezuela, Chernabog was his favorite character of all time and that was the reason he wanted to work at Disney, so Eric helped him out and Jorge drew it.\u201d As for bringing the voices, at least 40 original voice guests including Jodi Benson (Ariel), Jeremy Irons (Scar), Idina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna) enthusiastically said yes to returning. Yvett Merino was simple. She says, \u201cIt said, \u2018We\u2019re working on a short film to celebrate the 100 years. We\u2019d love you to be a part of it and many came into the recording session not knowing anything about it. For anyone that came in, we\u2019d show them the boards. To have them come back and visit characters that they hadn\u2019t done in years, so many were grateful to be included and to be a part of it.\u201d Correy and Abraham\u2019s first recording was Auli\u2019i Cravalho as Moana, and as each voice character came back, they\u2019d fondly recall stories of what their characters meant to them. From the very beginning, Correy and Abraham knew Robin Williams\u2019 iconic genie needed to be a part of it. Simonsen and producer Merino reached out to the estate. Says Simonsen, \u201cWe tried to take them on the journey with us to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got this very special short that we\u2019re doing. Robin as the genie means so much to so many people and we would really love to involve him. So Dan listened to the outtakes from the original recording and he found those little bites that we could use. We went back to the estate and said, \u2018This is what we hope to do.\u2019 Eric, who originally animated the genie is on the show, and he\u2019s going to be part of it.\u2019 And it was wonderful to see that happen.\u201d Piecing the voices and characters together in a nine-minute short was a challenge. The first cut hit the 13-minute mark. With thousands of characters to choose from, the biggest challenge wasn\u2019t just picking the characters, it was deciding who would rise to the top. One sequence had \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u2019s\u201d Ariel in the restroom combing her hair. Next to her was the Dinglehopper. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d says Correy. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What are we doing?!\u2019\u201d With Jodi Benson returning to voice the character, they needed her to sing or at least say something, and so they shifted things around to incorporate a speaking part. Richard Sherman\u2019s cameo came at the suggestion of the studio\u2019s head of music, Matthew Walker. The Award-winning composer recorded a new version of the Mary Poppins hit, \u201cFeed the Birds.\u201d Says Merino, \u201cThat was the pinch-me moment.\u201d ",

        "content": "\u201cRick and Morty\u201d has finally revealed the voice actors who are replacing star Justin Roiland, who was dropped from the hit animated show after domestic violence charges. Ian Cardoni is the new voice of Rick Sanchez and Harry Belden is Morty Smith. Their names appeared in the credits for the Season 7 premiere on Sunday night. The opening credits also omitted the usual \u201cCreated by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon\u201d and only featured the \u201cRick and Morty\u201d logo. These will be the highest profile roles in the careers of both Cardoni and Belden. Cardoni has had minor roles in the films \"Grown Ups\" and \"Clear History,\" while Belden has made one-off appearances in the TV shows \"Chicago Med\" and \"Joe Pera Talks with You.\" The characters\u2019 new voices were first heard in the Season 7 trailer, which debuted in September, but Adult Swim wouldn\u2019t reveal the people behind them. Screeners for \u201cRick and Morty\u201d released before the season launched didn\u2019t include credits at the end. Representatives for the show said they\u2019d reveal the voice actors\u2019 names under embargo ahead of the Season 7 premiere on Oct. 15, but Adult Swim then reneged on that promise Friday, saying over email, \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to continue to keep the names of the new voice cast actors confidential until Sunday night\u2019s east coast premiere.\u201d Adult Swim fired Roiland in January after he was charged with domestic violence. The Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office later dismissed the charge in March. Roiland was co-creator of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d with Dan Harmon, in addition to voicing several other characters on the show. In September, NBC published a report alleging that Roiland used his fame over the years to lure and meet young women, several of whom were underage. One of the women alleged Roiland sexually assaulted her; through his attorney Roiland has denied the allegations. \u201cRick and Morty\u201d follows the titular grandfather-grandson duo as they travel through the universe. In addition to the trailer, Adult Swim poked fun at the new voices in the logline for the upcoming season: \u201cRick and Morty are back and sounding more like themselves than ever,\u201d the summary reads. \u201cIt\u2019s season seven, and the possibilities are endless: what\u2019s up with Jerry? EVIL Summer?! And will they ever go back to the high school?! Maybe not! But let\u2019s find out! There\u2019s probably less piss than last season. \u2018Rick and Morty,\u2019 100 years! Or at least until season 10!\u201d \u201cRick and Morty\u201d debuted in 2013 and has received critical acclaim. Season 7, premiering on Adult Swim on Oct. 15, will include 10 new episodes. Roiland was also co-creator and lead voice actor on Hulu\u2019s animated comedy series \u201cSolar Opposites\u201d; Dan Stevens has been announced as his replacement for the voice of lead character Korvo.

        "title": "Couples online are sharing how an 'invisible string' tied them together before they ever met",
        "content": "Before Georgia Harris met her boyfriend, he had appeared in the background of her photos at an event they both attended years ago. Now, she\u2019s approaching her second anniversary with the man who sneaked into her camera roll before she ever knew he existed. When she posted about her love story on TikTok, people flooded the comments section suggesting their relationship proves the \u201cinvisible string theory,\u201d or the idea that the universe covertly connects people who are destined to meet one day. The centuries-old concept is gaining renewed traction on TikTok as young people like Harris share how they and their partners\u2019 lives intersected multiple times before they finally met. \u201cIt is an absolute crazy coincidence \u2014 but I think the timing for us was absolutely right, and what\u2019s meant to be will be,\u201d said Harris, 25, who lives in Perth, Australia.  In the comments on Harris\u2019 video, a TikTok user claimed her husband was in the background of her childhood best friend\u2019s home video. Another wrote that she and her husband appeared in the background of each other\u2019s photos when she was at her ex\u2019s college formal. And yet another said she and her husband attended the same wedding 12 years before they met. The hashtag #invisiblestringtheory spiked last week, accruing more than a million views in the last seven days. I believe a lot in the universe, like whatever happens, it happens for a reason. \u2014 ISABELLE WHITLOCK, 21 Many on TikTok are using audio from Taylor Swift\u2019s song \u201cinvisible string\u201d \u2014 which professes that \u201call along there was some invisible string tying you to me\u201d \u2014 to share their love stories. The song alludes to East Asian folklore around the \u201cred thread of fate\u201d that ties together lovers who are ultimately destined for each other. Isabelle Whitlock, 21, lived less than five minutes away from her now-boyfriend all her life. They grew up in the same small town, went to the same schools and even appeared in the same yearbook photos together \u2014 but the two never met until they matched on a dating app in summer 2022. \u201cI believe a lot in the universe, like whatever happens, it happens for a reason,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cAnd I think it was true for us: We met at the perfect time. If we\u2019d met earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have been ready for each other.\u201d Having experienced a string of what she described as toxic relationships, Whitlock said she could have pushed her partner, who she now believes is \u201cthe one,\u201d away had she met him too early in life. In her TikTok video participating in the trend, she wrote that although she doesn\u2019t know how they went so long without meeting, they both needed to forge their own paths before their lives converged. Whitlock and her boyfriend, Aidan Squires, who now live in Manchester, England, said they were shocked by just how widespread the phenomenon seemed to be among couples around the world. \u201cNow that we have a platform where you can share these sorts of things and it can be seen by pretty much anyone anywhere in the world, it makes these stories expand a lot quicker,\u201d said Squires, 23. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something we would have thought about before, but as soon as [this trend] came up, we were like, oh, my God.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Love empanadas? More Latino comfort foods enter the American dining scene",
        "content": "QUEENS, New York \u2014 By midmorning, a steady stream of people are making their way to a cozy corner business in New York City's borough of Queens. Their destination? The Empanadas Caf\u00e9, celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. \u201cWhen we started, if our clients were not Latin American, they didn\u2019t know what an empanada was,\u201d owner Patricia Bernard said. \u201cWe had to explain to them that it was like a turnover. Today that\u2019s not the case; people know empanadas, and it\u2019s entered the U.S. vocabulary.\u201d Here in one of the nation's most diverse counties, restaurant and caf\u00e9 owners are among the broader wave of restaurateurs and chefs who have brought Latino flavors into the American culinary mainstream. Whether it be through food trucks, neighborhood restaurants, or meal order or meal prep apps, food items and dishes known mostly to Latinos are now enjoyed by more diners, while still giving Hispanics a taste of home. \u201cEmpanadas are comfort food for Latin Americans,\u201d Bernard said, \u201cand our American clients love them; they\u2019re the first thing to go at parties.\u201d Her team makes empanadas with white flour (familiar to people from Argentina and Chile) and corn flour (popular with Colombians and Venezuelans) and fills them with ground beef, chicken, cheese or mixed vegetables. Back in Queens, the word of mouth on Bernard's empanadas is so strong that the caf\u00e9 has never had to advertise. \u201cPeople just find us,\u201d she said. \u201cThough once in a while, someone will come by and ask for a taco!\u201d Empanadas are far from uniform; as with other Latino foods, there are variations depending on the country of origin, and these differences may not be known to non-Latino diners. In Puerto Rico, they\u2019re usually fried and are also known as empanadillas or pastelillos; in countries like Argentina and Uruguay, empanadas are usually baked. In the Queens neighborhood of Jackson Heights, the Arepa Lady is a Colombian restaurant specializing in arepas, stuffed cornmeal cakes that are somewhat like empanadas \u2014 but not the same. \u201cIn Colombia and Venezuela, arepas are mostly for breakfast, or street food,\u201d manager Brandon Klinger said. \u201cFor some people from Latin America, it is strange to them at first, to see a sit-down restaurant for arepas. But we want people to have a different experience, and to taste something they won\u2019t taste anywhere else.\u201d The Arepa Lady restaurant began as a food cart run by Mar\u00eda Cano. A lawyer and a judge in Colombia, she fled to the U.S. in the 1980s to provide a better life for her family. With work opportunities scarce, she started selling food on the street, including arepa de choclo (sweet corn arepa) and arepa de queso (a folded-over pancake made with corn flour and cheese). Her arepas inspired a devoted following, with one food critic writing for the New York Post in 2016 that they \u201chad more lasting influence on the city\u2019s eating scene than a dozen big-name launches featuring famous chefs and designers.\u201d \u201cWe have very diverse customers,\u201d Klinger said, gesturing to Asian, African American and Latino patrons sitting in the restaurant. \u201cSometimes people are surprised that we are a Colombian restaurant because arepas are so associated with Venezuela, but the two countries just give their arepas different names.\u201d As the U.S. Latino population has grown, so has the Latino influence on American food and drink. It has been over a decade since tortillas and salsa began outselling hamburger buns and ketchup, and tequila is poised to overtake vodka as the country\u2019s top liquor.  Evelia Coyotzi, owner of Evelia\u2019s Tamales, remembers when non-Latino customers did not know how to eat her signature offering. Tamales are a traditionally Mexican dish consisting of masa, made of hominy, which is wrapped around a filling and steamed in a corn husk. \"They would bite into the husks; they didn\u2019t know how to unwrap them,\" said Coyotzi, who's from Tlaxcala, Mexico. Tamales are also found on the menu of Cuban restaurants, since they're also common in their cuisine, with a slightly different seasoning. Because tamales are labor-intensive to make, many U.S. Latinos associate them with special occasions, like Christmas Eve or New Year's Day. But Coyotzi sells tamales year-round, and to great acclaim. She has been profiled by The New Yorker and hailed by Munchies, part of Vice, as \u201cThe $1 Tamale Queen of New York.\u201d Prior to opening her storefront caf\u00e9, Coyotzi spent 20 years selling tamales from a cart near an elevated subway line, starting at 4:30 a.m. each day. These days, social media helps drive their business, according to Coyotzi\u2019s son, John Garcia. \"Content creators, food writers, now they come to Queens, while before they mostly stayed in Manhattan,\" he said. \"Videos made here go viral, and we get people from all over the world.\" At The Freakin Rican restaurant in the Astoria section of Queens, which specializes in Puerto Rican food, executive chef and owner Derick Lopez said that his top sellers are pasteles. Unlike tamales, which are wrapped in corn husks, pasteles are usually made with a masa or dough made of green plantains that's filled \"with a mixture of pork and roasted peppers inside,\" he said, that's then wrapped in a plantain leaf and steamed.  Inside The Freakin Rican, the late Afro Cuban singer Celia Cruz plays from the speakers as customers tuck into plates of pernil (roasted pork) and mofongo (fried green plantains with garlic mashed and shaped into a ball). Two preppy young men give Lopez a wave as they head out, calling, \u201cThanks, that was wonderful! Delicious! We\u2019ll be back!\u201d Lopez learned to cook by watching his mother and by experimenting on his own. At times, he receives comments (from his YouTube channel) and emails from patrons, telling him that his dishes brought back memories of home, or of the cooking of a loved one who has died. \u201cIt\u2019s really touching. We\u2019re just working, cooking, and then, wow, you realize what an impact food can make on people,\" Lopez said. The food industry overall is changing for the better, said Alejandra Ramos, host of \u201cThe Great American Recipe\u201d on PBS. For example, a generation ago, most people ate hard, crunchy tacos, often with store-bought shells that came in a box. Toppings were basic, usually ground beef and cheese. \u201cNow, what we know of tacos is much more authentic than that.\u201d There are myriad factors that determine whether a particular Latin American dish catches on with the American public, including demographics and accessibility of ingredients, according to Ramos, who is also a contributor for NBC's \u201cTODAY\u201d show. Because Mexican Americans are the largest U.S. Latino group, she explained, Mexican food has tended to be more widely available compared to dishes from other countries. \u201cIf you think about popular Mexican dishes, like tacos or tamales, they use cornmeal, beef, things that can be easily obtained around the U.S. or can be imported easily,\" she said. \"Other foods, which I grew up eating as a Puerto Rican, require ingredients that can be harder to get.\u201d The Latino culinary influence on American tastes also extends to drinks \u2014 most notably coffee. In different neighborhoods in Queens, the avenues are lined with small caf\u00e9s offering caf\u00e9 con leche (a shot of coffee in a cup of hot milk), caf\u00e9 de olla (Mexican spiced coffee) and cortaditos (espresso with some steamed milk). While these names may be unfamiliar to some Americans, the flavors are likely not. Even Starbucks now offers customers recipes for making Cuban-style coffee. \u201cCoffee shops are really a great indicator of what trends are happening and what\u2019s being added to menus,\" Ramos said. \u201cRight now, in the coffee world there are a lot of young Latinos who are digitally savvy, and they are creating brands that are sustainable.\" These younger entrepreneurs are stressing the fact that this coffee is being grown and picked and sorted by people of color and women in smaller, sustainable farms across the Caribbean and Latin America, Ramos explained. By doing so, \"they are bringing a more nuanced sensibility to the industry,\" she said. Back at the Empanadas Caf\u00e9 in Queens, Patricia Bernard is well aware that empanadas have become a favorite among all kinds of people. In addition to her Latino customers, her business serves diplomats at the United Nations, artists at museums and fans at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships.  \u201cBut our busiest day,\u201d Bernard said, \u201cis Super Bowl Sunday. What could be more American than that?\u201d Raul A. Reyes, a lawyer, is a member of the USA Today Board of Contributors. He has written for The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Christian Science Monitor, Texas Monthly and the Huffington Post. ",

        "title": "'Bejeweled' Swifties fill theaters everywhere as the 'Eras Tour' film goes to the big screen",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Taylor Swift was here. At the Grove mall in Los Angeles on Thursday, the pop superstar's face was plastered on posters of  \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d film. A red carpet, on which Swift posed with fans (and Beyonc\u00e9), was still partially in place.  And for the Swifties who didn\u2019t get to go to the Hollywood premiere Wednesday, seeing the movie at the same mall the next evening was the next best thing.   Wearing friendship bracelets \u2014 like the ones traded at Eras Tour concerts \u2014 and sporting Swift-themed attire, dozens showed up to catch the opening night of the movie\u2019s release. Eli Countryman, 25, had already bought tickets for what was supposed to be opening Friday. But almost as soon as he saw Swift\u2019s surprise announcement Wednesday changing the date, he knew he was in for a back-to-back screening. \u201cI was doing all my deep thinking like I usually do in the shower. And as soon as I got out, I texted my roommate and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t make plans tonight. Because we\u2019re coming here,\u2019\u201d he said, as he accepted a friendship bracelet from a fellow moviegoer. Swift may help give a boost on the scale of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d to the box office \u2014 analysts are predicting that the concert film could make as much as $150 million during its opening weekend, according to CNBC. That would make it one of the highest openings of this year. The concert film will play in more than 4,000 movie theaters in the United States, Canada and Mexico, including in all AMC locations in the country, the company said in a news release. It will also play at every ODEON Cinemas location throughout Europe. While the early showings at the Grove on Thursday weren\u2019t packed, the crowd was enthusiastic. Many belted Swift\u2019s lyrics as they waved, gestured and clapped along with her routines. Several performances drew applause within the theater. Decked out in a re-creation of Swift\u2019s bedazzled black \u201cReputation\u201d bodysuit, Hailey Hermida said the show made her experience the emotion of every song. It was almost spiritual, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s especially cool seeing her through every single stage of her life. It\u2019s like watching a story, almost,\u201d said the 16-year-old, who was there with her mother and a friend. \u201cIt\u2019s like you can feel so connected to a person even if you don\u2019t know them and I think that\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d In New York City, another small but enthusiastic crowd turned up at Lincoln Center\u2019s AMC to relive the magic of Swift\u2019s tour. Will Bartow, 34, sported a Travis Kelce jersey, in honor of the rumors that Swift is dating the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. Swift was spotted cheering on Kelce at the Chiefs-Broncos game Thursday night. \u201cFunnily enough, I had already ordered this as my Halloween costume before Taylor ever showed up at the game,\u201d Bartow said.  His fianc\u00e9e, Olivia Mattsey, 28, sported a \u201cLoving him was Red,\u201d T-shirt, referencing a popular Swift lyric from \u201cRed.\u201d The two didn\u2019t get to go to the actual Eras Tour \u2014 they said the resale costs were too high, especially since they are planning a 2024 wedding. So this was Mattsey\u2019s opportunity to experience the tour, which took the world by storm.  \u201cI will dance, I will sing, I will cry, probably,\u201d she said before entering the theater.  At first, the audience appeared reluctant to shake it off.  But when \u201cBlank Space\u201d began to play, the theater turned into a party \u2014 and half of the audience stood up and ran to the front and began an impromptu dance party. When Swift switched to the acoustic portion of her show on screen, the dance party in the theater ended, and someone screamed \u201cIt\u2019s surprise song o\u2019clock!\u201d  The comment was in reference to how Swift performed two surprise songs at each of her concerts. Ahead of the concert film's release, many were wondering which two would make the cut. Some in the crowd sang along to the first surprise song, \u201cOur Song,\u201d from Swift\u2019s debut album. Others could be seen wiping their tears as the second surprise song, \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid,\u201d played. As the weekend approaches, theaters continue to brace for the arrival of Swifties en masse.  At Marcus Theatres, some locations are setting up stations to make friendship bracelets for the occasion. At AMCs, specialty popcorn buckets featuring the Eras Tour logo on them (which are $14.99, including popcorn) are expected to sell out fast.  \u201cI had to justify this popcorn bucket to my parents,\u201d said Natalie Shane, 19, who was at the Lincoln Center AMC on Thursday. \u201cI was like, \u2018Guys, this is gonna be used as storage. It\u2019s not going to be thrown away. This is gonna be on display in my room.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, at Alamo Drafthouse theaters, singing is encouraged.  \u201cEven we know that there\u2019s no possible way to not sing along when hit by the power of Taylor Swift,\u201d the company wrote in its FAQ for the film. \u201cSo while there won\u2019t be Rowdy Screenings per se, we\u2019re definitely down with you getting a little rowdy at the screenings \u2014 within reason, of course. Let\u2019s keep it fun and cute out there.\u201d     Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "title": "Music sparked the nation's largest farmworker movement, civil rights icon attests",
        "content": "Activists will tell you that music has the power to change things. Dolores Huerta, one of the most influential labor activists in the 20th century, attests that music was a crucial spark in America's largest farmworker movement. \u201cSo much of the music from that time was meaningful. And it told the story of migrants who had come to America to work,\u201d Huerta said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cTheir songs memorialized what was going on.\u201d Huerta, 93, is featured with guitarist Carlos Santana, singer-songwriter Joan Baez, actor Edward James Olmos, and other celebrities in \u201cSong for C\u00e9sar,\u201d a new documentary about the late, legendary Mexican American labor leader C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and the music that made thousands of previously invisible farmworkers popular in mainstream America. \u201cYou\u2019re either part of the problem or part of the solution,\u201d Santana said in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s no in-between.\u201d The documentary by musician Abel Sanchez and Andres Alegria, which was made in the course of 15 years, weaves interviews with acclaimed performers and footage of the time to show the power of songs like Joan Baez's \u201cNo nos mover\u00e1n,\u201d (\"They won't move us\") or Little Joe's \"Viva la Huelga\" (\"Long Live the Strike\"). One song that Huerta remembers fondly is \u201cHuelga en General\u201d (\u201cThe General Strike\u201d), which was written by Luis Valdez and became popular during the Delano grape strike in 1965.  The protest song tells the story of Filipino and Mexican farmworkers teaming up to win a collective bargaining agreement with major table grape growers in California.  Huerta describes the five-year protest as a milestone for the labor movement because it established a blueprint for other protests to combine community organizing with boycotts, marches and other forms of nonviolent resistance.  \u201cOur volunteers and farmworkers went up to the cities and talked to the labor groups and community groups. They asked people not to eat grapes, and they did!,\u201d Huerta recalled proudly. The family of the late poet and memoirist Maya Angelou was one of millions of Americans who supported farmers by boycotting grapes.  For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. \u201cSe\u00f1or Ch\u00e1vez had asked that we don\u2019t eat grapes. So we didn\u2019t eat grapes at home. My son was about 9. He went to school, and they were serving grapes. He walked out of school,\u201d Angelou said, laughing, in an interview filmed before her death in 2014. \u201cI said, \u2018No, you have to go back.\u2019 He said, \u2018These are evil people.\u2019 I said, \u2018They\u2019re just ignorant.\u2019\u201d  Huerta worked side-by-side with Ch\u00e1vez and other activists to cofound the National Farmworkers Association in 1962. And she says that all of them, including C\u00e9sar and his wife, Helen, were volunteers. They didn\u2019t get wages, but \u2014 Huerta emphasizes \u2014 they had everything they needed to keep working.   \u201cWe had food, we had shelter, we had a day care center for the kids. And if anyone got sick, all the hospital bills were paid for,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have money in hand sort of speak. It was all communal.\u201d Despite the organization\u2019s accomplishments, Huerta also recognizes that many of the benefits that they won for workers in California have not yet been won in other states where they \u201cstill don\u2019t have the right to organize, the right to form unions or the right to collect unemployment insurance.\u201d Huerta has advocated for civil rights, labor and women for more than 60 years. And in 2012, President Barack Obama honored her with the country\u2019s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Now, reflecting on her accomplishments, Huerta would like to be remembered by one of the principles that defined her activism. \u201cWhen you look at C\u00e9sar\u2019s legacy, and I would like to add my name to that also, people should remember how you can win through nonviolence. That you don\u2019t have to have violence to get the victories that workers need,\u201d she said. Asked to give younger generations advice for the future, Huerta shared an anecdote from Ch\u00e1vez to call them to action.  \u201cC\u00e9sar was recruiting a student to work for the union. And he said that when you\u2019re at school, you read about history, you write about history, you talk about history. But when you become an activist, you make history,\u201d she said. \u201cSo this is what it is: When you\u2019re in an organization and you collectively take actions together, you make history.\u201d \u201cA Song for C\u00e9sar\u201d is streaming for free on PBS until Oct. 27 and will be available after that on PBS Passport. Arturo Conde is an editor and a bilingual freelance journalist. He writes for La Opini\u00f3n A Coru\u00f1a and has been published in Fusion, Univision and City Limits.   ",

        "title": "Here's why Doja Cat is considered controversial online, even to her fans",
        "content": "Doja Cat on Thursday became the latest star to join the popular internet show \u201cHot Ones,\u201d which features celebrities eating spicy chicken wings while answering questions.  But her appearance \u2014 which was tied to her recent album, \u201cScarlet,\u201d and touched on her evolution as an artist \u2014 comes after months of mounting controversy. Many of her fans (who refer to themselves as \u201cKittenz\u201d) have called out the rapper for some of her recent actions, including when she openly mocked some of them.   A representative for Doja Cat didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. She didn't address any of the recent backlash during the show. Here\u2019s a look at why she has been so controversial online.   Last week, Doja Cat posted, then deleted, a photo of herself wearing a shirt showing YouTuber Sam Hyde, who is known for his alt-right leanings. She later re-uploaded a cropped selfie that hid the shirt design. The caption of the photo is a series of eye roll emojis.  Hyde is an alt-right comedian known for his YouTube channel and his Adult Swim show, \u201cMillion Dollar Extreme: World Peace,\u201d which was canceled after one season. The show was criticized because of its edgy sketches and his social media posts supporting alt-right conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, he said in a 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Hyde also donated $5,000 to the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer in 2017 when the Southern Poverty Law Center sued it for organizing a harassment campaign against a Jewish woman, according to the Los Angeles Times. When the Times asked him why he donated the money, Hyde said, \u201cYou can say I want reporters to know I make more money than them.\u201d The photo featured on Doja Cat\u2019s shirt depicted Hyde carrying a gun. The image has been used as a meme in response to multiple mass shootings over the years, with trolls claiming \u201cSam Hyde is the shooter.\u201d After the 2017 Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting, memes of Hyde duped Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who incorrectly said Hyde was the shooter. Doja Cat fans expressed disappointment at her posts. Some compared her recent behavior to that of Ye, whose fans denounced him this year after he praised Adolf Hitler and Nazis. Doja Cat hasn't publicly responded to the backlash against her shirt.  In July, Doja Cat took to Meta\u2019s Threads to tell fans to get off their phones and \u201cget a job.\u201d After a fan account asked for a preferred fan base nickname, she doubled down, writing, \u201cJust delete the entire account and rethink everything.\u201d She also denied a person\u2019s request to say she loved her fans. \u201cI don\u2019t though because I don\u2019t even know y\u2019all,\u201d she wrote. After the heated exchanges with multiple fans, major presences in the \u201cKittenz\u201d world, including the Twitter fan pages @DojaNews, @thekittensroom and @DojaHQs, signaled their discontent by deactivating their accounts. The fan account @dojacatbrazil announced an indefinite break this week. Some behind the accounts who spoke to NBC News at the time said they had hoped she would issue some kind of an apology.  Doja Cat was spotted kissing Twitch streamer and musician Jeffrey Cyrus, better known as J. Cyrus, in December. Fans criticized her affiliation with Cyrus, who has been accused of emotionally abusing and manipulating his female Twitch moderators. Cyrus issued a now-deleted apology in 2020 acknowledging the accusations from his moderators, according to Rolling Stone.  \u201cThere is no excuse nor justification for my actions. I was careless. I was greedy. I was ignorant. I was disrespectful. And I was completely in the wrong. In a position of power and trust, I gave into the temptations and attention of those who looked up to me,\u201d he wrote.  When fans called her out for her alleged relationship with Cyrus, Doja Cat wrote in an Instagram comment, which included profanities, that she doesn't care what people think about her or her personal life. She hasn't addressed it further. Doja Cat received backlash in May 2020 for allegedly frequenting chatrooms for incels, or \u201cinvoluntary celibates,\u201d and white supremacists. Videos of her participating in such rooms on the messaging app Tinychat began circulating on social media at the time.  The videos resulted in the trending hashtag #dojacatisoverparty on X. Fans accused her of laughing at racist jokes and appealing to incels in the chatrooms.  Doja Cat said in a 2019 interview with Paper Magazine that she had a \u201creligious obsession\u201d with certain unnamed chatrooms as a teenager. \u201cPeople would pick on me and use horrible, horrible language, just the worst, and I just didn\u2019t understand why people were so crazy on there,\u201d she told the magazine. She added that she would join in on the fun by making \u201coffensive jokes and do things sort of out of the box.\u201d After she was criticized for her time in the chatrooms, she apologized in a now-deleted Instagram post and said she never said anything racist in the calls. \u201cI\u2019ve used public chat rooms to socialize since I was a child. I shouldn\u2019t have been on some of those chat room sites, but I personally have never been involved in any racist conversations. I\u2019m sorry to everyone that I offended,\u201d she wrote in the now-deleted Instagram post, according to Complex. She added that she was proud to be a Black woman with South African heritage.  In 2015, Doja Cat released a song with title that was a racial slur that originated on the message board of the extremist forum 4chan.  The phrase came out of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. It is derived from the phrase \u201cdidn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d and it is used to mock victims of police brutality, according to Know Your Meme.  Doja Cat responded to criticism over her use of the word in an Instagram Live session in May 2020. She said she had heard the phrase the day she created the song. She said that members of a chatroom she was in had called her the phrase and that the song was an act to reclaim the slur used against her.

        "title": "Everything you need to know about 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' movie",
        "content": "Swifties, it\u2019s time to bust out your friendship bracelets again. The concert film \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is heading to theaters. While the movie was originally scheduled to roll out in theaters on Friday, Swift made an announcement on social media Wednesday, saying that theaters in the U.S. and Canada would start showing the movie early \u201cdue to unprecedented demand.\u201d That means you can expect enthusiastic moviegoers to sing, dance and swap friendship bracelets starting tonight. Here\u2019s what else to know about the theatrical concert film experience. AMC Theatres hosted a world premiere for the movie Wednesday at The Grove mall in Los Angeles. In typical \u201cMastermind\u201d fashion, the event was full of surprises. Swift showed up in a blue dress at around 5:30 p.m. P.T., according to Today.com. She posed with fans on the carpet. Later, inside, Swift addressed attendees. The 12-time Grammy winner also had a special VIP guest \u2014 and no, it wasn\u2019t her rumored boo Travis Kelce. Fellow music legend Beyonc\u00e9 showed up to support Swift. \u201cIm so glad I\u2019ll never know what my life would\u2019ve been like without @beyonce\u2018s influence,\u201d Swift wrote in an Instagram post caption of a photo of her and Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cThe way she\u2019s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms. Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She\u2019s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.\u201d According to Today.com, around 2,000 people \u2014 including celebrities like Adam Sandler and Julia Garner \u2014 were lucky enough to snag a seat at one of 13 of AMC\u2019s theaters inside. \u201cYou care so much about these shows and that made all the difference for us,\u201d Swift said to attendees inside. \u201cIt made us want to add even more shows and just keep doing the tour and I think that I just have never felt this way about anything, the way that I feel about this experience that we have had and continue to have. So, I am so proud.\u201d The concert film features footage from three of Swift\u2019s Los Angeles shows at SoFi Stadium, where she performed a set list of over 40 songs. Professional filming equipment was spotted onstage during the shows Aug. 3-5. SoFi Stadium is also where Swift concluded the first leg of the U.S. tour and on Aug. 9 announced the re-release of her album \u201c1989.\u201d The film will play in more than 4,000 movie theaters in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, including in all U.S. AMC locations, AMC said in a news release. It will also play at every ODEON Cinemas location throughout Europe. In U.S. theaters, the film will have at least four showtimes per day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at all AMC locations, the theater chain said. Some showings are, of course, already sold out for this weekend \u2014 but you\u2019ll likely be able to snag a seat at some point during the 13 weeks it\u2019s expected to be in theaters. There were two surprise songs at each of the concerts that were filmed, meaning there were six possible songs that had the potential to make final cut. Those songs were: \u201cI Can See You,\u201d \u201cMaroon,\u201d \u201cOur Song,\u201d \u201cYou Are in Love,\u201d \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re on Your Own, Kid.\u201d  Spoiler alert: The surprise songs that made it into the film are \u201cOur Song\" and \u201cYou\u2019re on Your Own, Kid,\u201d from Swift's debut album and \"Midnights,\" respectively. No, this is a concert film \u2014 not like Swift\u2019s Netflix documentary \u201cMiss Americana.\u201d The movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 48 minutes, which is about half an hour shorter than her actual live show. This means it is unlikely there will be behind-the-scenes or other documentary-style footage beyond the live concert itself. AMCs might not be stadium arenas \u2014 where Swift\u2019s concerts took place \u2014 but the concert film will likely not be a typical movie theater experience. \u201cEras attire, friendship bracelets, singing and dancing encouraged,\u201d Swift said in her announcement post on Aug. 31.  Swifties are likely going to show up to the theater in everything from their Eras Tour merch to handmade costumes. \u201cI think there needs to be 2 separate theaters for the eras tour movie- one for cozy merch and chilling and the other for going absolutely feral in the outfit you didn\u2019t get to wear to the live show,\u201d one fan posted on the social media platform X. Since the Eras Tour kicked off in March in Glendale, Arizona, it has been projected to become the highest-grossing tour of all time. Now, the movie is expected to break records, too. Advance ticket sales have surpassed $100 million worldwide, according to The Associated Press. \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" is projected to surpass Justin Bieber's 2011 \"Never Say Never\" movie as the biggest concert film ever. Bieber's film grossed over $73 million, not accounting for inflation. Even producer Jason Blum said Blumhouse Productions changed the date of its latest release, \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" due to Swift. \"The one thing that scares me to death is Taylor Swift,\" he told EW. \"We had this amazing Friday the 13th in October, which is the single best day to release a scary movie... Obviously, we moved off that [date] and we bowed our head to Taylor Swift,\" he said. Like with \"Barbenheimer,\" this will likely be another big cultural moment. Movie theaters seem ready. \"Take your phone out,\" Greg Marcus, the chief executive and chair of the Marcus Corp., told the AP. \"Take selfies. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere.\" He said in a TikTok video that there will be friendship-bracelet-making stations. AMCs will be offering limited-edition items like \u201cEras Tour\u201d-themed cups and popcorn buckets. Swift is now a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but unfortunately the \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert film will not be eligible for an Oscar.  Per academy rules, \u201cWorks that are essentially promotional or instructional are not eligible, nor are works that are essentially unfiltered records of performances.\u201d Under the current guidelines, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s upcoming movie, \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d are both ineligible for Oscar contention.

        "title": "Eva Longoria promotes access to books and multicultural stories in new partnership",
        "content": "Growing up in Texas, Eva Longoria and her sisters loved reading and thought the local library was \u201cthe funnest place in the world,\u201d as she put it. Their mother was a teacher, so Longoria was raised to value books and learning. But she is aware that not all children are so lucky.  On Wednesday, Longoria, the actor and director of \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot,\u201d announced a partnership with Mott\u2019s to make it easier for families to access multicultural stories. Mott\u2019s is launching a mobile library that will travel across the country, along with a program that allows families to get free books with qualifying purchases of Mott's Fruit Flavored Snacks. Longoria hopes to help raise awareness of diverse books and authors, especially given the ongoing controversies over book bans and ethnic studies. \u201cWe are in a moment where we should not be limiting access to books. We should be increasing access to books,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now live in a global community, and books are the gateway to the world. ... The stakes are very high in our country.\u201d While Longoria recalled loving books from \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d to \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d she rarely saw herself in the stories she enjoyed as a child. Even now, she pointed out, only about 7% of characters in published books are Latino. It wasn\u2019t until Longoria had her son that she became more aware of Latino books aimed at children. \u201cI saw these titles called Lil Libros, these bilingual storybooks, and I thought, hey, I wish I\u2019d had those when I was a kid.\u201d  The children\u2019s books in Mott\u2019s \u201cSnacks and Stories\u201d program include several titles by Latino authors, including \u201cIslandborn\u201d by Junot Diaz, \u201cWhat Can You Do With a Paleta?\u201d by Carmen Tafolla and \u201cToo Many Tamales\u201d by Gary Soto. Some of the books are bilingual, as well.  \u201cIt is important for everyone to have access to different cultures and different communities so everybody can read stories with Latino characters,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cOur being reflected in stories educates other people about us, and it also educates us about ourselves.\u201d The media and the publishing world greatly influence how young people see themselves, she added. \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see ... and when we don\u2019t see ourselves, we feel erased.\u201d Longoria is proud that the mobile library will visit cities like San Antonio, Houston, Chicago and Kansas City, Missouri, home to some communities known as \u201cbook deserts.\u201d \u201cI was surprised to see that where I grew up was considered a book desert,\u201d Longoria said of her native San Antonio. The city\u2019s population is about two-thirds Latino. According to Molly Ness, the founder of the \u201cEnd Book Deserts\u201d podcast, a book desert is a geographic area or community where books and reading culture are difficult to access. \u201cThe term can refer to an actual geographic place or to populations that are overlooked or underserved by public libraries and bookstores,\u201d Ness said. Nearly half of children in the U.S., 45%, live in book deserts, according to the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cBook deserts are a combination of several things,\u201d Ness said. \u201cThere are public schools that have limited resources for their libraries, so kids can\u2019t take home books with them, and some families don\u2019t take advantage of public libraries because of transportation issues, proof of residency requirements or late fees.\u201d She cited research showing that in high-income communities, there are about 13 books for every child. By contrast, in high-poverty communities, there is about 1 book for every 300 children.  Ness is optimistic, however, about ongoing literacy and book access efforts. \u201cSmall grassroots groups, nonprofits and major corporations are all coming up with innovative ways to tackle this problem,\u201d she said.  Houston writer and activist Tony Diaz said a variety of societal factors can contribute to book deserts. \u201cIn some urban areas, the large corporate booksellers do not value or invest in our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are illiterate about Latinos, and so we don\u2019t get bookstores in our parts of town.\u201d Compounding the problem, he said, are that Latino students might not have access to books by and for Latinos and that teachers often don\u2019t have curriculum guides to teach about such books.    The result of such factors, Diaz said, \u201cis that young Latinos grow up feeling like poetry, the fine arts and literature are not for them.\u201d It is that type of outcome that Longoria hopes initiatives such as her partnership with Mott\u2019s can help prevent. \u201cI didn\u2019t curate the titles\u201d in the Mott\u2019s book program \u2014 \u201cbut about half of them were already in my home library,\u201d she said.  \u201cThis project is special to me, because I am a voracious reader, and I feel that accessibility to books and diverse storytelling is so important,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cIt was a no-brainer for me to get on board, especially with my intense desire for our community to have access to different books and also to be reflected back through them.\u201d   Raul A.

        "content": "Salman Rushdie has a memoir coming out about the horrifying attack that left him blind in his right eye and with a damaged left hand. \u201cKnife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder\u201d will be published April 16. \u201cThis was a necessary book for me to write: a way to take charge of what happened, and to answer violence with art,\u201d Rushdie said in a statement released Wednesday by Penguin Random House. Last August, Rushdie was stabbed repeatedly in the neck and abdomen by a man who rushed the stage as the author was about to give a lecture in western New York. The attacker, Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and attempted murder. For some time after Iran\u2019s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a 1989 fatwa calling for Rushdie\u2019s death over alleged blasphemy in his novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d the writer lived in isolation and with round-the-clock security. But for years since, he had moved about with few restrictions, until the stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution. The 256-page \u201cKnife\u201d will be published in the U.S. by Random House, the Penguin Random House imprint that earlier this year released his novel \u201cVictory City,\u201d completed before the attack. His other works include the Booker Prize-winning \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh.\u201d Rushdie is also a prominent advocate for free expression and a former president of PEN America. \u201c\u2018Knife\u2019 is a searing book, and a reminder of the power of words to make sense of the unthinkable,\u201d Penguin Random House CEO Nihar Malaviya said in a statement. \u201cWe are honored to publish it, and amazed at Salman\u2019s determination to tell his story, and to return to the work he loves.\u201d Rushdie, 76, did speak with The New Yorker about his ordeal, telling interviewer David Remnick for a February issue that he had worked hard to avoid \u201crecrimination and bitterness\u201d and was determined to \u201clook forward and not backwards.\u201d He had also said that he was struggling to write fiction, as he did in the years immediately following the fatwa, and that he might instead write a memoir. Rushdie wrote at length, and in the third person, about the fatwa in his 2012 memoir \u201cJoseph Anton.\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel third-person-ish to me,\u201d Rushdie said of the 2022 attack in the magazine interview. \u201cI think when somebody sticks a knife into you, that\u2019s a first-person story. That\u2019s an \u2018I\u2019 story.\u201d ",

        "title": "Aaron Rodgers challenges Travis Kelce to Covid vaccine debate",
        "content": "Sidelined New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers challenged Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce on Tuesday to debate the effectiveness of Covid vaccines. The pro football standouts have been trading barbs since Rodgers mocked Kelce for partnering with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in a campaign to encourage people to get their flu shots and Covid vaccinations. Rodgers mocked Kelce, calling him \"Mr. Pfizer,\" before fans fired back at him, pointing out that he is \"Mr. Johnson & Johnson\" playing for the Jets \u2014 owned by Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson. \u201cWho knew I\u2019d get into the vax wars with Aaron Rodgers, man?\" Kelce joked with reporters last week. \"Mr. Pfizer versus the Johnson & Johnson family over there.\u201d Rodgers didn't mention Kelce's name in his weekly check-in on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Tuesday, but he clearly had him in mind when he referred to the ongoing debate. \"I made a tiny little joke about a guy shilling for a potentially ... corrupt company and everybody kind of loses their minds,\" Rodgers said. \"Mr. Pfizer said he didn't think he would be in vax war with me. This ain't a war, homie. This is just conversation,\" the amused Rodgers continued. \"But if you want to have some sort of duel, debate, have me on the podcast, come on the show, let us have a conversation.\" Rodgers' bit included talk of proxy fighters in a comparison to the movie \"John Wick: Chapter 4.\" \"I'm going to take my man RFK Jr., independent, and he can have, you know, Tony Fauci or some other pharmacrat and we can have a conversation about this,\" Rodgers said, mentioning independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist. In 2021, only months after Covid vaccines were first rolled out, Rodgers admitted to having made \"misleading\" comments by saying he was \"immunized\" against Covid-19, which was taken to mean he had been vaccinated. Rodgers eventually disclosed he hadn't been vaccinated but had instead taken ivermectin, a drug typically used on livestock and pushed by podcaster Joe Rogan. Both Covid and flu shots are overwhelmingly safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends an annual flu shot for everyone ages 6 months and older \u2014 ideally in October, when flu cases typically start to rise. People ages 6 months and older who haven\u2019t gotten Covid shots within the last two months should also get updated Covid vaccinations this fall, according to the CDC. Kelce stood by his endorsement of vaccination talking to reporters last week. \"I got it because of keeping myself safe, keeping my family safe, the people in this building, so yeah, I stand by it 1,000%\" he said. \"I\u2019m fully comfortable with him calling me Mr. Pfizer.\u201d Before this recent vaccine debate, Kelce had also been in the national spotlight because of his increasingly public relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift. She attended his Chiefs games on Sept. 24 and Oct. 1, drawing many Swifties to football for the first time. And in the process the pair have increasingly become the targets of conservative vitriol. For years, Swift has urged her young fans to register to vote. David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

        "title": "Israel-Hamas war discourse shows the increasingly fraught nature of online speech",
        "content": "Kylie Jenner shared a pro-Israel Instagram story post and quickly removed it. A New York University law student faced vitriol after a message of \u201csolidarity with Palestinians\u201d was posted on X. And a handful of nonprofit organizations, which have long advocated for a two-state solution, said they are drawing backlash. That is how some conversations around the war are playing out online, particularly on Instagram and X \u2014 and it has been divisive. After the Palestinian militant group Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel over the weekend and Israel\u2019s retaliatory bombing in Gaza, social media users have made sweeping statements arguing on behalf of one side or the other and condemning those who find nuance. While it isn\u2019t the first war in the social media age, the heated discussions have underscored just how polarizing the topic is and how things can quickly turn ugly on the internet.  \u201cModerating war content is genuinely a huge problem for social media platforms, and it\u2019s one that no one really has an answer to,\u201d Abbie Richards, a content creator who specializes in misinformation and disinformation research, said in a recent video on Instagram.  \u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s traumatic and deeply disturbing, especially to people who are affected. \u2026 On the other hand, it\u2019s reality,\u201d said Richards, who referred NBC News to her video when she was asked for an interview. \u201cActually seeing the consequences of war, not just hearing about them but seeing them, that could change who you vote for. That\u2019s powerful. But on the other, other hand, war is a misinformation minefield.\u201d  Matthew Nouriel, who is Iranian, Jewish and queer, said they have been vocal about Israel because they have seen comments on social media that appear to diminish Jewish people\u2019s right to be angry about the attack. \u201cIt feels suffocating,\u201d said Nouriel, who works as a digital producer for the Tel Aviv Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides \u201cstrategic solutions for combating hate online.\u201d \u201cWe have every right to be angry. We\u2019re watching our people go through this.\u201d Nouriel said that as a creator, they feel \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of misinformation being put out there,\u201d which is why they \u201cfeel a responsibility to carve out the information that I know to be true as factually as I can.\u201d One of Nouriel\u2019s most recent posts got over 18,000 likes. The first slide reads, \u201cHamas\u2019 attack on Israel is not about Palestinian liberation, it is about massacring jews.\u201d Nouriel said they believe \u201ceveryone should speak up about every injustice that takes place amongst any community.\u201d However, they added, \u201cI think there\u2019s a line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed \u2014 when you start speaking over people.\u201d For some activists, the backlash to their posts is familiar \u2014 but it feels heightened in the current online environment. IfNotNow, a Jewish American youth-led movement founded in 2014 that organizes to \u201cend U.S. support for Israel\u2019s apartheid system\u201d and advocates for equality, justice and a future for both Palestinians and Israelis, received a mix of hateful messages after it posted a statement Saturday.  The group condemned Hamas\u2019 attack on Israeli civilians and argued that Israel\u2019s \u201cdecades of Palestinian oppression\u201d had led to the escalation in violence on both sides.  Numerous replies to the statement, some of which were viewed by NBC News, attacked IfNotNow with antisemitic language, some of it comparing the Jewish organization to neo-Nazis. Eva Borgwardt, IfNotNow\u2019s political director, said she has recently seen a \u201cdouble standard\u201d play out online when it comes to conversations about Israel and the Palestinian cause. \u201cThere\u2019s a double standard in terms of when \u2018you don\u2019t know enough\u2019 to take action or take a stand,\u201d Borgwardt said. \u201cThe idea that you don\u2019t know enough is often only applied in one direction. \u2018You don\u2019t know enough\u2019 if you\u2019re trying to support Palestinian rights. Those with authority rarely accuse you of \u2018not knowing enough\u2019 if you are unequivocally supporting Israel at all costs.\u201d But the instinct to provide additional context has also become a point of contention online in recent days. Numerous social media posts have argued there is no room for the \u201cboth sides\u201d dialogue. Some online have called others out for material that they say diminishes the conflict to just an infographic. Others have accused people \u2014 particularly those who have no knowledge of the Middle East and its vast history \u2014 of posting without knowing what they are talking about.  Social media activism often encompasses infographics explaining sociopolitical dynamics in a particular crisis, viral fundraising or mutual aid efforts and shared lists compiling contact information for grassroots advocacy to elected officials. At times, what people share on platforms has aligned with the expressed goals of a particular social movement.  For example, last year in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in Iran, activists in the country implored the outside world to amplify news of the Women Life Freedom movement. In other instances, online activism has been criticized as \u201cperformative,\u201d and it has backfired on the efficacy of protesters\u2019 goals.   The summer of 2020 saw a global protest movement against police violence toward Black Americans. At one point, Instagram users posted black squares to their feeds for #BlackOutTuesday to signal solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Users were accused of virtue-signaling, and some activists said that rather than promote the cause, the posts instead silenced critical information about protests. With the Israel-Hamas war, people with varied perspectives share a common concern that not enough people are speaking up on social media about what\u2019s going on. In a social media post Tuesday, the comedian Chelsea Handler, who is half Jewish, addressed the backlash surrounding those who have been silent. She wrote that \u201call desire peace for Israelis and Palestinians\u201d and that there is \u201cno excuse for this kind of barbarism.\u201d  However, \u201ceveryone processes everything in their own time so screaming and yelling at people about why they aren\u2019t posting or saying anything is also part of the problem,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet people understand the full scope of what\u2019s happening, why it\u2019s happening, and the root of the problem. This is terrorism.\u201d Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News Digital. She can be reached at Kat.Tenbarge@nbcuni.com Uwa Ede-Osifo is a news associate for NBC News. ",

        "content": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner reached a temporary child custody agreement, court documents filed Tuesday show. Turner will get their two children \u2014 ages 1 and 3 \u2014 from Oct. 9 through Oct. 21, according to the order. The children will then go back with Jonas from Oct. 21 through Nov. 2. The schedule will continue on a rotating basis with Turner getting the children through Nov. 22, Jonas getting them through Dec. 16, and Turner once again having them until Jan. 7. The order allows the \"Game of Thrones\" star to return to the U.K. whenever she has the children. Last month, they had agreed to a temporary order to keep the children in New York. The former celebrity couple, who announced their split on Sept. 6 after four years of marriage, have been in a court battle over where they want their young children to live. Turner had filed a petition suing Jonas for the return of the children to England, where the family had made their permanent home. Turner's filing accused the Jonas Brothers singer of wrongfully keeping the children in New York City and refusing to turn over their passports. In a statement, Jonas said that handing over the passports would be in violation of a court order in Florida, where he filed for divorce. He also said he was okay with the children being raised in both countries. The children had been traveling with the pop star and a nanny during his U.S. tour while Turner filmed a new drama series in the U.K. Turner was supposed to fly to New York City in mid-September to bring the children back to the U.K., according to her filing, but the pair announced their divorce before that could happen. In Jonas' divorce petition, he said the marriage was \"irretrievably broken\" and requested \"shared parental responsibility\" for their children. Attorneys for Turner and Jonas have not responded to a request for comment on Tuesday. Diana Dasrath is entertainment producer and senior reporter for NBC News covering all platforms.

        "title": "A longtime Latino political strategist \u2014 and dad of a famous son \u2014 is writing a memoir",
        "content": "Nowadays, he may be introduced as Lin-Manuel Miranda's dad, but decades before his son became a Broadway sensation and a household name, Luis Miranda had carved an influential role in local, state and national Latino advocacy and politics. The veteran Democratic political strategist and founder of one of the largest Latino nonprofit groups is taking stock of his and his family's trajectory, his work and his take on the diverse and growing Latino electorate in his memoir, \"Relentless: My Story of the Latino Spirit That Is Transforming America,\" which will be published in both English and Spanish next May by Hachette Books. When asked why he decided to write it now, Miranda gave two reasons as he spoke to NBC News last week ahead of the book's announcement. One, he said, was finding himself increasingly \"getting frustrated\" over the analysis of the Latino vote after Donald Trump's election as president, when it seemed to him that many had \"just discovered\" that there are segments of the Latino population that vote Republican, despite generations of Mexican American, Cuban American and other voters consistently supporting GOP candidates. \"They were making all these assumptions and judgments when they just didn't have the whole picture,\" he said. \"The second piece that hit me,\" Miranda, 69, said about his decision to write the memoir, \"was that you're getting old and you are going to die.\" When it came to what he was reading \u2014 and disagreeing with \u2014 regarding Latino voters and other issues, he said he told himself \"it doesn't matter that you disagree; it just means that somebody else's voice is the one that is heard\" if he didn't write his own account and put it on the record. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Miranda came to New York to pursue a graduate degree and pretty quickly fell into Latino community organizing and mobilization. He became director of the Office of Hispanic Affairs under then-Mayor Ed Koch and subsequently worked in different positions under several New York City mayors, including Rudolph Giuliani. In 1990, he founded the Hispanic Federation, one of the largest Latino nonprofit groups, and was a founding partner of the MirRam group, a Democratic political consulting group. His work with Democratic politicians has tracked changing Latino demographics, such as the growing Dominican American presence in New York and elsewhere and its first elected officials. But Miranda is clear about how Lin-Manuel Miranda's name recognition and influence following his success with \"Hamilton\" and later projects like the Disney movie \"Encanto\" have given the family a big platform for a host of Latino and national issues, such as raising money for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria or pandemic relief. \"My son got a huge mic, and the second he got a huge mic, he shared it with all of us \u2014and allowed to work as a collective, because we think so much alike,\" Miranda said, speaking not just about his work and advocacy, but also the work of his wife, Luz Towns-Miranda, a clinical psychologist and professor who has focused on foster care and who's active in reproductive rights. Miranda said he's been asked why he doesn't write a book about \"raising a genius\" and he said he has no interest and doesn't \"have a clue \u2014 we just raised kids and we did it the Puerto Rican way.\" Miranda's professional arc starts with his migration to the mainland from Puerto Rico. The Caribbean island archipelago is a U.S. territory, so while Puerto Ricans like Miranda are not immigrants in the legal sense of the word, \"when you came here \u2014for the regular New Yorker, there was really no difference\" in the way he was perceived, he said in his still-accented English. Miranda said that, as a young man, his initial focus was on creating consciousness of Puerto Rico's colonial status and the island's needs, but as he spent time in New York and as Puerto Ricans like him were increasingly called \"Latinos,\" he spent time \"figuring out what that means\" and shifting to ways to work collectively. When asked about the changes he's seen in the decades he's been working in politics, including more political division and extreme points of view, Miranda laughed and said that unlike young people, \"old people cannot afford to be pessimistic.\" \u201cWe come here to look for different things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to spend time looking for the things that unite us and are going to help us move forward.\u201d Sandra Lilley is managing editor of NBC Latino.

        "title": "Teens are selling products on TikTok Shop between classes",
        "content": "High schoolers are testing out their social media marketing skills with a new side gig: TikTok Shop. Teens on the app are bringing in millions of views using the new feature, despite the fact that TikTok forbids minors from applying to the program. NBC News identified six TikTok accounts that have published dozens of TikTok Shop videos over the past two weeks. The creators all identified publicly as under the age of 18.  In a statement responding to questions about the presence of teens on TikTok Shop, a TikTok representative said, \u201cAs TikTok Shop rolls out in the US, we continue to evolve our safeguards and are taking steps to address this issue.\u201d TikTok asks users for their age when signing up for an account, which offers a loophole \u2014 kids can pretend to be older. The findings are the latest demonstration of how users are quickly taking advantage of the relatively new TikTok Shop functionality to make money. The feature, launched in September, has rapidly gained popularity and TikTok has appeared to struggle to moderate how people are using it. It also demonstrates the rapid influence that TikTok Shop\u2019s new system, which encourages the fast production of internet advertising by creators, is having on the internet. One of the creators, who said on his profile (which had over 33,000 followers) that he was 16, made a TikTok Shop advertisement for $4 women\u2019s leggings that said the wearer \u201cmay get pregnant\u201d \u2014 a joke about how good the wearer would look in the leggings. In the video, the teen danced to \u201cBillie Jean\u201d (in which Michael Jackson sings, \u201cBut the kid is not my son ... \u201d). Another video the same teen made advertising the leggings, in which he imagined a \u201c10/10 baddie\u201d wearing them, has over 1.1 million views.  In the two weeks since its debut, TikTok Shop has made major waves in the social media advertising scene, with the app becoming a conduit for a new type of commission-based marketing. With TikTok Shop, users can advertise nearly any product available through the app and get a cut of the sale. The company also makes it easy for large and small retailers to sell their goods via the shop. TikTok Shop videos are served to TikTok users via the same algorithm that determines the \u201cFor You\u201d page, which means that videos that quickly get engagement will often be pushed out to even bigger viewership almost instantly.  This has resulted in a near-endless stream of TikTok Shop videos marketing all kinds of products, including dubious health supplements and too-good-to-be-true gadgets. Some TikTok Shop videos feature clips copied from content like podcasts that the creator uses to advertise an unrelated product. In that case, the creator isn\u2019t affiliated with either the content or the product. Many of the creators using TikTok Shop are adults, and typically they either make the product they\u2019re advertising, are sponsored by the company whose products they\u2019re advertising, or they order the products to test them before advertising them.  Some teens appear to have jumped onboard as well, posting videos that look like they\u2019re shot in high schools with backgrounds showing lockers, desks and hallways. Some are even recorded during class. Some of the TikTok Shop creators don\u2019t appear to be using or buying the products they\u2019re marketing. Some are just putting text over a simple background with a plea to purchase the product, sometimes even making a series of videos with slight differences advertising a product over and over again \u2014 dozens or even hundreds of times \u2014 trying to get an algorithmic win on at least one video.  The TikTok Shop feature is not supposed to be used by minors, but the voluntary age submission process has allowed teen users to slip through the cracks. While TikTok requires people selling their own products to provide TikTok with a form of government-issued ID, creators who are just advertising other people\u2019s products don\u2019t have to prove their age. According to the TikTok Shop Content Policy, \u201cCreators are prohibited from uploading, posting, streaming, or sharing any content that targets minors,\u201d including content trying to persuade minors to buy products or services or content to try to get minors to persuade their parents to buy them products or services. Much of the merchandise being sold on TikTok Shop comes from China, even though it is being sold by many creators in the U.S. The same teen made a video advertising a studded $10 belt with the caption: \u201cImagine your parents this belt just whoop you.\u201d That video has over 1.2 million views. The teen made all three videos in the same day.  The leggings the teen advertised are from a brand listed on TikTok Shop as Ying Fu Apparel, based in Zhejiang, China. The belt was from a brand called \u201cHeartinBelt\u201d that is also based in Zhejiang.  Some teens making TikTok Shop videos are actually trying the products that they\u2019re advertising. One girl who said she was 15 made a TikTok Shop video lip-syncing to the song \u201cCreep\u201d by Radiohead. She advertised the Radiohead T-shirt she was wearing in the video, which she wrote was \u201ccute af\u201d and \u201conly costed me like $1.27.\u201d Her video was viewed 2.8 million times.  The shirt, which currently costs $13.99 to $58.99 on TikTok Shop, is being sold on the platform by an individual based in Missouri whose products include a lot of music merchandise. TikTok Shop has been compared to Chinese fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, but executives at the company have reportedly said they view TikTok Shop more like Amazon. In some ways, TikTok Shop has emerged as a new concept altogether \u2014 not fast-fashion production, but fast-advertising production. It\u2019s a no-holds-barred approach to affiliate marketing, a type of influencer brand marketing popularized by early-to-mid 2000s bloggers. Affiliate marketing is when a company like Shein contracts an influencer to create content marketing their clothes. Often, that influencer is provided with an \u201caffiliate code,\u201d which shoppers can use like a discount code. Because the influencer is an affiliate, they receive a cut of the proceeds from purchases made with their code.  TikTok Shop streamlines this concept so that companies don\u2019t need influencer marketing employees and creators don\u2019t need to be influencers. Anyone with at least 5,000 TikTok followers can begin making affiliate content for TikTok Shop \u2014 although NBC News spotted accounts with fewer followers making TikTok Shop content, too.  According to TikTok\u2019s rules, users must be 18 and provide valid tax and banking information to enroll in TikTok Shop. Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News Digital.

        "title": "TikTok creators say beauty industry still has an inclusivity problem",
        "content": "Black creators on TikTok expressed their disappointment toward makeup brand Youthforia after it recently launched its skincare-infused foundation Date Night, with a shade range they say is not inclusive of deeper skin tones. Beauty creators have been calling out brands for their lack of inclusive foundation shades for a while. Earlier this year, Tarte Cosmetics received backlash for its treatment of influencers of color and has also offered limited shade ranges in the past. While the rise of Fenty Beauty led to a reckoning within the cosmetic industry, the issue has persisted \u2014 and creators say Youthforia is the latest brand to drop the ball. \u201cWe know that Black buying power is so powerful, especially in beauty,\u201d said Christina Abiola, 26, a beauty and lifestyle creator. \u201cAnd then to not even be included, it\u2019s definitely something in 2023 that cannot keep happening.\u201d Representatives for Youthforia did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Youthforia launched four medium deep to deep shades of the Date Night foundation, which has a total of 15 shades. The company\u2019s founder Fiona Co Chan posted an initial response to the backlash last week explaining that the initial launch was a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d or a limited test to see if the product could be successful.  Some Black creators said it felt like Chan\u2019s response tried to excuse the lack of inclusivity, rather than take accountability for it.  \u201cYou already created the product,\u201d Abiola said. \u201cYou knew exactly who you were selling it to. And then, once people actually spoke up and realized, \u2018This product wasn\u2019t made for me,\u2019 and they came out and spoke about it, [Youthforia\u2019s] first response was to make excuses and not even acknowledge anything that we said.\u201d Others suggested that the shade range offered sent a message about who Youthforia\u2019s target audience was.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get an option,\" said beauty creator Chlo\u00e9-Ana Braidy, 25, who reviewed the foundation on her TikTok page after the brand sent her products to try. \"We didn\u2019t get a chance to see if we liked it or not. We were just immediately excluded [right] off the bat.\" We were just immediately excluded [right] off the bat. -BEAUTY CREATOR CHLO\u00c9-ANA BRAIDY'S REACTION TO YOUTHFORIA\u2019S DATE NIGHT FOUNDATION LAUNCH In her video, she emphasized that Black and brown people need more than four shades available to them.  While she doesn\u2019t have the darkest skin tone, Braidy said she still struggled to find a good match. She tried one of the medium deep shades, but had an issue with the product\u2019s undertones, or the warm or cool hues reflected in a person\u2019s skin tone. She said the foundation later looked gray, which was a common complaint among reviewers with deeper complexions. Beauty creator Priscilla Oluwasola, 22, said company's foundation launch made it seem like Black consumers were an afterthought to them. \u201cI feel like people need diversity in their teams,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if there was possibly a darker skinned woman on Youthforia\u2019s team, this is something she could have picked up.\u201d Oluwasola suggested that founder Chan should review the product images with her marketing team because the darkest shade, No. 495, on the website looks different than the shade that was given to darker-skinned creators.  Other creators, like Abiola, also pointed out the discrepancy between the product photos on the Youthforia website and try-on videos on TikTok. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure what\u2019s going on with that, but it doesn\u2019t look good because now the credibility of the brand is being put in question,\u201d Oluwasola said. \u201cSo not only are they being discussed about not being inclusive, there\u2019s the issue of dishonesty.\u201d Chan posted a second video on Thursday responding to the criticism. In it, she apologized more directly and explained that more shades were being developed. She also said that the product photos on the website were not altered in any way.  \u201cI just wanted to come on and say I\u2019m extremely sorry,\u201d Chan said in her apology video. \u201cWhen I first started Youthforia two years ago, all I wanted to do was create a safe space where individual beauty could be celebrated. And unfortunately with our latest launch, we just fell short of that mission.\u201d She said she will be meeting with community leaders to figure out the best way the brand can improve.   With more brands coming out with diverse shade ranges, inclusivity seems like the bare minimum when it comes to new complexion products. Abiola said that she believes makeup brands should develop at least 30 shades before launching foundations. \u201cWe deserve to be included,\u201d Abiola said. \u201cThere should just be a standard, no matter what, for every single brand.\u201d Those who spoke with NBC News about the beauty brand said they\u2019d try the foundation again if the company expanded its shade range. However, they added that it would take time for them to rebuild trust with the company. \u201cIt may take some time to grow, to get back the trust of your community,\u201d Abiola said. \u201cSo I just hope that they hear the things that we\u2019re seeing and implement them and actually work to create more inclusive products for their brand.\u201d Daysia Tolentino is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "John Cena on hypocrisy of his feud with Dwayne Johnson over move to Hollywood: 'I was wrong'",
        "content": "John Cena was asked at a Saturday press conference for WWE Fastlane about his own hypocrisy in his former feud with fellow wrestler-turned-Hollywood-actor Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. Cena has said that his beef with Johnson was fueled by his anger over Johnson abandoning WWE in order to become an A-list Hollywood actor, which is exactly the career move Cena would later take himself. Cena admitted in May that he was \u201cshort-sighted and selfish\u201d in feuding with Johnson, and now he told press that \u201cI 100% see and understand\u201d how people could consider him a hypocrite for calling out Johnson and then following in his footsteps. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been following what I\u2019ve tried to do, especially as of late, publicly and personally to Dwayne Johnson, I\u2019ve stated that although I thought I was trying to do what\u2019s best for business,\u201d Cena said about starting the feud. \u201cI went about it the wrong way. I violated his trust and I made allegations about his perspective that I knew nothing about. And deep down, I was a fan. I wanted The Rock back [in WWE]. I wanted to do anything to get The Rock back, but I did it the wrong way.\u201d Cena continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it the respectful way, so I had to eat a little bit of crow. I had to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry and I was wrong,\u2019 because I am sorry and I was wrong, and that\u2019s a very humbling experience. Dwayne is a hell of a guy\u2026 I became who I despised. I see that perspective and I understand it. It was a great learning experience from my mistake with feuding with The Rock.\u201d With his Hollywood career currently on pause because of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, Cena decided to once again return to the world of WWE for the Fastlane event. Asked whether or not Hollywood plans to take him away from WWE once the strike is resolved, Cena answered, \u201cThey do. They do.\u201d \u201cI made it perfectly clear you can\u2019t do both because of the liability insurance,\u201d Cena explained. \u201cIf I were trying to juggle both that\u2019s very selfish because I\u2019d put a whole lot of people in the movie business out of work if something happened to me.\u201d \u201cI stopped a project in the middle of [the strike], and I cant talk about it because of the strike we\u2019re in,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of it. As soon as we get back to work, we go back to work. I don\u2019t control any of that. I\u2019m crossing my fingers and hoping we can find a resolve that everyone is happy with. For right now, I think this is the best way I can help\u2026 by coming home to my family.\u201d Watch Cena\u2019s full press conference in the video below. ",

        "title": "'Tube Girl' inspires unapologetic self-expression among women on TikTok",
        "content": "What started as one woman filming herself dancing on trains has turned into a global movement, with thousands on TikTok attempting to emulate the confidence of the so-called Tube Girl. Sabrina Bahsoon, 22, has become known for filming herself dancing and lip-syncing to catchy songs on the London Tube using an ultra-wide 0.5 camera lens. Since achieving viral fame last month, she\u2019s walked the runway for MAC Cosmetics during fashion week and been the face of several ad campaigns. But her commercial success is just one ripple effect of her videos, according to many of her 680,000 followers on TikTok. With the \u201cTube Girl\u201d trend, women are rejecting social norms and simply having fun in public spaces, even if it makes themselves or others cringe.  \u201cIf I was to influence anyone about anything, it\u2019s to not care. Stop caring about what people think,\u201d Bahsoon told TODAY.com in a recent interview. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, you\u2019re left with your own thoughts, your own accomplishments. If you\u2019re having regrets, because you started to just listen to people and what they would think then it\u2019s just like, so sad.\u201d NBC News interviewed some of the women who posted their own \u201cTube Girl\u201d renditions. Here\u2019s why they they say \"tube girl energy\" is empowering. Age: 48 Location: Seattle On the first day of classes at the University of Washington last week, McNichols stood in the middle of an auditorium stage, whipped her phone around her body and lip-synced confidently into the camera as her 1,200 students looked on. \u201cHonestly, it was just so much fun. I felt competent. I felt powerful,\u201d said McNichols, who teaches human sexuality at the school. \u201cI think I felt exactly the way Tube Girl did.\u201d Her video racked up more than 11 million views on TikTok \u2014 and it gained her the admiration of some of her students, who filmed her filming the TikTok (meta!).  McNichols said she hoped partaking in the bold and silly trend would make her more relatable to her students so they feel comfortable engaging with her in class.  It took two takes because on her first attempt, students cheered so loudly that she couldn\u2019t hear the music. \u201cThe trend is about self-empowerment, self-confidence, not caring what other people think, and I think that it is particularly true among women,\u201d McNichols said. \u201cThe popularity of this trend is riding off of a wave of 'Barbie' and Taylor Swift, where it\u2019s just about shutting off what other people think and what other people want us to be and what people want us to do.\u201d Age: 18 Location: Seattle Hoang, a student at UW, was among the students in McNichols\u2019 class. She filmed her professor partaking in the trend \u2014 which went almost as viral as the original video.  Seeing McNichols kick off class by doing the trend made her seem less intimidating, Hoang said. But she's noticed that many critics of the trend have expressed annoyance at seeing people film themselves in public, often deriding the women who partake as suffering from \u201cmain character syndrome.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s obnoxious.\u2019 But I think some people just need to relax and not be so uptight,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cBecause when people dance in public, they\u2019re always having fun. And some people are just being judgy because it\u2019s not a norm.\u201d While Hoang said she herself is not a dancer, the \u201cTube Girl\u201d phenomenon has influenced her to step out of her comfort zone and feel more confident filming her own digital content. Age: 28 Location: Los Angeles Seeing someone like Tube Girl pull off something that would typically be embarrassing has the effect of \u201cimbuing [the viewer] with confidence,\u201d Rocha, who is a model, said. Inspired by Bahsoon\u2019s videos, Rocha pulled out her phone and attempted to replicate the trend while walking out of Target. It took her about six tries to get the angles down, including several amid throngs of people, before she uploaded a version she was satisfied with. By then, she said, the embarrassment had worn off. \u201cIt almost feels impossible to not think about what other people think about you. But what\u2019s that one saying? Courage is not the absence of fear, but having fear and doing it anyway,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cI feel really similarly about confidence. Confidence isn\u2019t the lack of self-esteem issues, it\u2019s having them but pushing past them anyway.\u201d Age: 19 Location: New York City Pa, who is a student, said she knew she wanted to try the \u201cTube Girl\u201d trend as soon as she saw it online.  Women are more likely to be the target of critics who claim they are being too over-the-top, too frivolous or simply unfunny, Pa said. But she\u2019s now adopted the mindset that something is only embarrassing if she chooses to believe it\u2019s embarrassing. \u201cAnytime you step out in public or you get on the subway, strangers are just gonna judge you no matter what, whether you sit quietly with your headphones or you stand up and dance crazily. So I feel like it\u2019s just about not giving power to anyone else,\u201d Pa said. \u201cAnd if you have a song that makes you feel hot and confident, why not have some fun with it?\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "How Sophie Turner won the battle of public perception",
        "content": "In the battle of public perception, Sophie Turner appears to have bested Joe Jonas in their highly publicized divorce proceedings, a review of social media activity has found. A review of viral TikTok and X posts about the situation found that the large majority of online content made about the divorce is outwardly supportive of Turner. Celebrity women often bear the brunt of negative publicity during high-profile breakups and divorces, but in this case, Turner\u2019s perceived silence in the face of negative narratives about her has benefitted her public perception. She also benefited from being an acclaimed TV actress who had minimal negative attention paid to her before now. Molly McPherson, a public relations and crisis communications professional, says that the treatment of Turner is providing a model for other celebrities embroiled in their own divorces. Turner has been supported by prominent figures like feminist writer Roxane Gay and actress Jessica Chastain. She publicly appeared with Taylor Swift \u2014 whose recently re-recorded albums include references to her own breakup with Jonas \u2014 numerous times since the divorce became public, and Swift has reportedly given Turner and her children use of one of her apartments in New York City while Turner and Jonas are engaged in custody mediation. McPherson, who has over 430,000 followers on TikTok, said she and other public relations professionals have already learned from Turner\u2019s successful playbook \u2014 staying largely silent in the face of media attacks.  \u201cIn my work I\u2019m having conversations where someone will say, \u2018Are we going to do the Sophie Turner?\u2019\u201d McPherson said. \u201cI think what we\u2019re going to find is more publicists are going to follow the Sophie Turner playbook, and they are going to look at a response now in a more calculated way that results in them having a firm control of the narrative at all times.\u201d  A representative for Jonas shared a lengthy statement in response to a request for comment. NBC News previously covered the statement, which in part said that Jonas was not responsible for the negative media narratives about Turner.  \u201cJoe has already disavowed any and all statements purportedly made on his behalf that were disparaging of Sophie. They were made without his approval and are not consistent with his views,\u201d the statement said in part. \u201cHis only concern is the well-being of his children.\u201d When TMZ first reported on Sept. 6 that Jonas had observed Turner from a Ring camera saying or doing something that led him to file for divorce, online audiences weren\u2019t just surprised. They were suspicious.  Over the past month, the breakdown of the celebrity couple\u2019s four-year marriage, as well as the ensuing custody battle involving their two children, ages 1 and 3, has played out through social media and tabloids.  On Sept. 3, TMZ first reported that boy band member Jonas and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actress Turner were heading for divorce. Two days later, Jonas filed for divorce and joint custody, and TMZ reported that a source close to Jonas said, \u201cShe likes to party, he likes to stay at home.\u201d According to McPherson and vocal supporters of Turner, it has become obvious to people online when a celebrity uses the media to go on the offensive. Even if a celebrity wasn\u2019t quoted directly, audiences are keen to deduce how publicists or other members of a celebrity\u2019s team can influence media narratives. \u201cPeople online are more media literate than they used to be. Because the internet is a place that celebrates and rewards sleuthing, that type of content falls into an algorithm that is rich with stories and shares and posts and comments,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cThe perfect counter-offensive to that move was to say nothing. Sophie Turner came out on top reputationally. It backfired spectacularly for Joe Jonas.\u201d  Soon after TMZ reported that Turner\u2019s partying habits had become an issue for Jonas, internet detectives found older interviews that indicated Turner preferred to stay at home, while Jonas wanted to go out. On Sept. 7, TMZ reported the opposite \u2014 that Jonas was \u201cless than supportive\u201d after Turner gave birth to their second child, and that he pushed her to attend public events with him against her wishes. It\u2019s not clear who TMZ\u2019s sources in this case were, or whether they were connected to Turner or Jonas.  \u201cWhen you see TMZ articles, it almost feels like that\u2019s the information you can\u2019t trust,\u201d said Ellie Schnitt, a podcaster and internet personality who tweeted on Sept. 6 that \u201cwhoever is doing PR for joe jonas needs to be fired expeditiously.\u201d Schnitt said social media, especially TikTok, helped her learn that when an article says \u201csources close to\u201d a celebrity, that\u2019s oftentimes a way of referring to a celebrity\u2019s team. \u201cClearly, he did something wrong to have to be putting out all this negative stuff,\u201d Schnitt said. \u201cThat was the impression I got. Particularly because there was nothing from Sophie or her team.\u201d McPherson said that what she thought were Jonas\u2019 efforts to plant stories relied on a PR playbook that has become \u201cantiquated\u201d in recent years. Celebrity teams are no longer able to direct public opinion through the media, McPherson added, because social media has eclipsed traditional news in its ability to affect public views.  \u201cThere was a time when denial and diminishing and rebuilding worked. That time was when you could kill a story,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cNow the internet and social media will not allow you to kill a story.\u201d It was the \u201cart of silence\u201d that Turner mastered in the court of public opinion, McPherson said, and some of McPherson\u2019s own followers can relate.  \u201cI have so many women in my comments and in my direct messages tell me how much they related to this story. They were married to someone who deployed the same tactics that Joe Jonas deployed, but on that neighborhood level,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cBeing silent takes a lot of work and energy to not speak up while you are being publicly smeared.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the TMZ stories that affected how audiences viewed Turner and Jonas. The fanbase of Jonas\u2019 boy band, the Jonas Brothers, which debuted in 2005 and rose in fame thanks to Disney channel shows and appearances, is mostly millennial women, Schnitt noted, which might make them more sympathetic to Turner\u2019s situation.  \u201cWhen you have a fanbase like the Jonas Brothers have, which is predominantly young women, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find them not supportive of another young woman,\u201d Schnitt said. Schnitt also pointed to Turner\u2019s popularity on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d where viewers literally watched her grow up. Turner was 15 when she was cast in the series, and she was 23 when the show ended. McPherson pointed out that \u201cQueen of the North\u201d was trending during the news of Turner\u2019s divorce, while Turner\u2019s character on the show was known for triumphing over the men around her.  \u201cI know it\u2019s not real and it\u2019s a TV show, but that sticks with you. You see her as a woman who has overcome these odds,\u201d Schnitt said.  Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News Digital. She can be reached at Kat.Tenbarge@nbcuni.com ",

During the Friday episode of his radio show, \"Table For One\" on SiriusXM\u2019s Sound 42, the Canadian rapper said he needs to focus on his health issues. \"Nothing crazy, but just like, you know, I want people to be healthy in life,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve been having the craziest problems for years with my stomach, I\u2019m just saying what it is.\u201d \"I got some other things I need to do for some other people that I made promises to but I probably won\u2019t make music for a little bit, I\u2019m gonna be real with you,\" the artist said.

        "title": "Bruce Springsteen announces rescheduled U.S. dates after ulcers halted tour",
        "content": "Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will be back on the street soon enough. After recently pushing back all of his remaining concerts for 2023 due to a health issue, Springsteen\u2019s camp has announced the makeup dates for the rescheduled shows set to take place in 2024. The new dates come in two clumps \u2014 a month-long swing taking place in mid-March through mid-April, followed by a second month\u2019s worth of shows in mid-August through mid-September. This rollout of dates represents all the U.S. dates that Springsteen put off. He has not yet revealed the makeup dates for the Canadian shows that were also recently postponed, but those makeup gigs are set to be revealed next week, the announcement says. The new U.S. dates are as follows: March 19 \u2014 Phoenix, AZ @ Footprint Center (rescheduled from Nov. 30, 2023) March 25 \u2014 San Diego, CA @ Pechanga Arena (rescheduled from Dec. 2, 2023) March 28 \u2014 San Francisco, CA @ Chase Center (rescheduled from Dec. 10, 2023) March 31 \u2014 San Francisco, CA @ Chase Center (rescheduled from Dec. 12, 2023) April 4 \u2014 Inglewood, CA @ Kia Forum (rescheduled from Dec. 4, 2023) April 7 \u2014 Inglewood, CA @ Kia Forum (rescheduled from Dec. 6, 2023) April 12 \u2014 Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun Arena (rescheduled from Sept. 16, 2023) April 15 \u2014 Albany, NY @ MVP Arena (rescheduled from Sept. 19, 2023) April 18 \u2014 Syracuse, NY @ JMA Wireless Dome (rescheduled from Sept. 7, 2023) April 21 \u2014 Columbus, OH @ Nationwide Arena (rescheduled from Sept. 21, 2023) Aug. 15 \u2014 Pittsburgh, PA @ PPG Paints Arena (rescheduled from (Sept. 12, 2023) Aug. 18 \u2014 Pittsburgh, PA @ PPG Paints Arena (rescheduled from Sept. 14, 2023) Aug. 21 \u2014 Philadelphia, PA @ Citizens Bank Park (rescheduled from Aug. 16, 2023) Aug. 23 \u2014 Philadelphia, PA @ Citizens Bank Park (rescheduled from Aug. 18, 2023) Sept. 7 \u2014 Washington, DC @ Nationals Park (rescheduled from Sept. 29, 2023) Sept. 13 \u2014 Baltimore, MD @ Oriole Park at Camden Yards (rescheduled from Sept. 9, 2023) The announcement said that all tickets for the postponed shows remain valid for the new dates. Information about refunds for anyone not able to make the rescheduled concerts is available through the companies that originally issued the tickets. It was previously announced, when the gigs were first postponed, that ticketholders would have 30 days to request a refund after the new dates were revealed. The revelation that Springsteen would be putting off all his shows for the remainder of 2023 came on Sept. 27. \u201cBruce Springsteen has continued to recover steadily from peptic ulcer disease over the past few weeks and will continue treatment through the rest of the year on doctor\u2019s advice,\u201d that announcement said. The first sign of trouble came when Springsteen missed gigs in Philadelphia on Aug, 16 and 18, bowing out because of an illness that was not revealed at the time. Those two shows were immediately rescheduled for August 2024. He returned to the road, briefly. Then, on Sept. 6, Springsteen postponed the nine remaining shows he had set for September, and at that time revealed the peptic ulcer diagnosis. It would be another three weeks before the news came that his recovery would take longer than expected and the towel was thrown in on the rest of the dates, which were originally to have concluded Dec. 12 in San Francisco.

        "title": "Joan Baez documentary explores her life, legacy and Mexican American heritage",
        "content": "One of America\u2019s best-known folksingers was around 13 the first time somebody called her \u201ca dumb Mexican.\u201d Joan Baez says in a new film that a teacher told her that she \u201cwas the highest breed of Spanish.\u201d But \u201cJoanie\u201d Baez, as she was then called, was not having it. \u201cI told her no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a Mexican. I was defending the Mexican race.\u201d Now a new documentary takes a look at the life and legacy of the iconic singer, songwriter and activist. In \u201cJoan Baez: I Am a Noise,\u201d filmmakers follow her on her final concert tour in 2018-19 and delve into her archive of home movies, artwork and diaries. In addition to highlighting Baez\u2019s lifelong commitment to social justice, the film explores issues of fame, identity, aging and forgiveness. Baez, 82, was raised in the San Francisco Bay area. Her father was a Mexican-born physicist, and her mother was of Scottish descent. Converts to Quakerism, Baez\u2019s parents instilled a social consciousness in her from a young age. Baez recalls in the film that, as a child, \u201cI was aware that there were sorrows way greater than mine.\u201d Growing up, Baez often felt like an outsider. \u201cI thought I was inferior, especially to the white kids, and the rich kids,\u201d Baez says in the film. \u201cMost of the time at school, I felt \u2018less than.'\u201d \u201cI Am a Noise\u201d Miri Navasky, one of the film's three directors, said that Baez\u2019s Mexican American heritage was \u201cfoundational\u201d for the singer. \u201cIt was huge for her, both as an insecurity, and as a source of empathy. ... I think that followed her through her whole life, and to some degree, still does.\u201d Singing was Baez\u2019s escape, her source of joy \u2014 and it led to what became an extraordinary career. A college dropout, Baez was singing barefoot in small coffeehouses around Boston when she was invited to perform at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival. There she was \u201cdiscovered\u201d and began a meteoric rise to fame. She sang at Carnegie Hall before she was 18 and landed on the cover of Time magazine at 21. \u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d Baez says in the film, \u201cI think I was the right voice at the right time.\u201d Baez\u2019s crystal-clear soprano and her activism placed her at the center of several musical and political movements. She sparked a resurgence of American folk music, sang at both the landmark 1963 March on Washington and at Woodstock, and helped bring Bob Dylan to prominence. She was in the fields with Cesar Chavez when he was organizing farmworkers and was visited in jail by Martin Luther King Jr. after being arrested for protesting the Vietnam War.  \u201cShe has always believed in the fight for the underdog, in social change, in nonviolence. She\u2019s never wavered from these areas of political activity,\u201d said \u201cI Am a Noise\u201d co-director Maeve O\u2019Boyle. \u201cShe\u2019s fought for what she believes in, her entire life. And running parallel to this is an incredible musicality, a love of creativity across the board.\u201d In the post-war years, there were many young people excited about the possibilities of new forms of self-expression and new ways of thinking, said New York University arts professor Richard Litvin. \u201cThen this brilliant young woman comes on the scene; she has obvious musical gifts and is charismatic, courageous and willing to be present for causes she believed in.\u201d Baez has sung on over 30 albums and scored a Top 5 hit with \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d in 1971. Other iconic songs include the Top 40 \"Diamonds & Rust,\" \"Farewell, Angelina,\" \"We Shall Overcome\" and \"Birmingham Sunday,\" about the 1963 Ku Klux Klan's bombing of a church in Alabama that killed four black girls. She also released a Spanish-language album in 1974, \"Gracias a la Vida,\" dedicated to the people suffering in Chile under the rule of the right-wing military dictator Augusto Pinochet. \u201cI Am a Noise\u201d was filmed over several years and captures Baez\u2019s \u201cFare Thee Well\u201d tour. \u201cIt became a real honor to document her in these moments,\u201d O\u2019Boyle said. \u201cJust to watch her on stage singing these incredible songs that have spanned 60 years was amazing. Witnessing her saying goodbye to that part of her life was a true honor.\u201d Karen O\u2019Connor, another co-director, notes that shooting the documentary was \u201cemotionally complicated. ... Joan was ready to open her life, to us and the world, but there was a level of trust involved.\u201d Baez did not have final approval over the film. As shooting progressed, Baez gave the filmmakers complete access to her personal archives. \u201cThe big act of total trust was just giving them the key\" to her storage unit, Baez told The New Yorker in September. \u201cI really thought it was lampshades and old plates. I didn\u2019t know that my father and mother kept everything. All the tapes I\u2019d ever sent them, all the letters I\u2019d ever written, all the drawings.\u201d These resources changed the course of the film, according to O\u2019Connor. \u201cShe basically turned over her entire family archive to us, which shifted the film in a very different way than we had imagined.\u201d The filmmakers were able to examine some of Baez\u2019s most personal struggles, including long-held family secrets. \u201cJoan Baez: I Am a Noise\u201d premiered at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival. It opens in New York City on Friday, Oct. 6, prior to a wider release. Deadline called the film \u201crewarding for revealing a major cultural personality in a satisfying fullness.\u201d Aside from performing, Baez has remained relevant for decades, often in surprising ways. In the early 1980s, she dated Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. In 2015, Taylor Swift invited her and Julia Roberts to dance on stage with her at a concert; four years later Baez sang with Lana Del Rey at a performance in Berkeley, California. Last year, Baez visited Ukraine with the Ukraine Children\u2019s Action Project, helping raise awareness for the war\u2019s youngest victims. \u201cJoan Baez captured the imagination of a generation. Maybe it was luck, her gifts, or her beautiful energy \u2014 but not everyone has the opportunity to be a singer, an artist, while taking on so many problems of the world,\u201d said Litvin, of NYU. \u201cThis is what a full life looks like.\u201d Baez received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2007. She was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2021. Raul A. Reyes, a lawyer, is a member of the USA Today Board of Contributors.

        "title": "TikTok users are convinced the bedbugs are coming for you. Some exterminators aren't as worried.",
        "content": "Many people online are worried about sleeping tight after recent news of a bedbug infestation in Paris. But exterminators \u2014 some who have built large followings online for their pest advice \u2014 say bedbugs have been, and always will be, around. \u201cThere\u2019s no additional risk, because bedbugs are everywhere,\u201d said Weston Storey, the exterminator behind the TikTok account exterminatorking.  So, there\u2019s no reason to panic \u2014 at least not yet, according to Storey and other experts who spoke with NBC News.   Heightened bedbug fears permeated TikTok this week as U.S. influencers began flying home from Paris Fashion Week, which ended Tuesday. Videos of bedbugs on public transportation in Paris were almost inescapable on social media. Overall interest in bedbug videos on TikTok rose, with the hashtag #bedbugs amassing 6 million views in the last seven days. People have posted videos scanning for bedbugs and sharing how they think the insects will start infesting U.S. cities because of travelers that bring them stateside. TikToker Christina Najjar, who is known by her username, Tinx, even shared a video saying that she was taking precautions against a bedbug infestation after she flew to New York City from Paris. She asked her followers for tips.  Bedbugs are \u201chitchhikers\u201d that latch onto fabric and wood, which is often how they get into homes, according to Jossue Rivas, an exterminator who runs the TikTok account bedbugsdaily.  On average, it takes three months for people to notice they have an infestation, he said. Bedbug eggs and nymphs can be too small to initially notice. The Covid pandemic slowed the spread of bedbugs because fewer people were traveling. But as more people have started traveling again, Rivas said, bedbug issues have been \u201cexploding.\u201d  Even so, he\u2019s not worried about the infestations. Both he and Storey said bedbugs have always been a potential issue. Many exterminators and dermatologists have been posting bedbug awareness videos on TikTok for years. The risk of taking bedbugs back from a vacation is dependent on the level of infestation, Rivas said. Large infestations may increase a person\u2019s chances of bringing bedbugs home.  He said he always checks the bed for bugs when he stays in hotels, including luxury ones.  \u201cBedbugs like to be anywhere from three to four feet within an infested item,\u201d Rivas said.  People should check the mattress and headboard at a new hotel, he said, noting that the first indicator of bedbugs is black feces, which appear like black spots in the fabric of the mattress. People can also look for the actual bugs or eggs themselves. Adult bedbugs are about the size of watermelon seeds, he said.  You can\u2019t really help where you get them, you don\u2019t know where they\u2019re at, but you can just be cautious and just mindful of where you\u2019re sitting and where your belongings are. -WESTON STOREY, THE EXTERMINATOR BEHIND THE TIKTOK ACCOUNT EXTERMINATORKING If people are skeptical about bedbugs in their hotel room, Rivas said, \u201cleave the luggage in the bathrooms.\u201d That\u2019s because bedbugs don\u2019t typically live in bathrooms or other harsh environments since there isn\u2019t a food source to sustain them in those places.  However, he noted, bedbugs can live up to a year without eating. If people suspect they have bedbugs on their clothing or luggage, Rivas said, they should wash their clothes immediately and put their luggage in heat, if possible. Bedbugs typically die at 125 degrees. People can also dispose of their items if they want to be extra cautious and can afford to get rid of them. The best thing people can do is to be aware of possible contact, Storey said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really help where you get them, you don\u2019t know where they\u2019re at, but you can just be cautious and just mindful of where you\u2019re sitting and where your belongings are,\u201d he said. Dr. Madalyn Nguyen, a dermatology resident who goes by madalynsmusings on TikTok, said that while not everyone has a reaction to bedbug bites, those that do might see a pattern called a \u201cbreakfast, lunch and dinner sign,\u201d which is a cluster of three bites.  Bedbug bites can be treated like most other bug bites. People who get bitten are typically able to ease the itchiness with an antihistamine, said Nguyen, who posted a video in July about how to check for bedbugs and what bedbug bites might look like. The most important thing that people do, she said, is to find and get rid of an infestation so that they don\u2019t get more bites While bites can be scary or gross to think about, Nguyen said, \u201cthe good thing about bedbugs is they don\u2019t usually transmit disease.\u201d Daysia Tolentino is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "AI Yearbook trend takes over social media",
        "content": "Social media users are leaning in to nostalgia and posting new yearbook photos \u2014 but they aren't going back to school to get them taken. Epik, an AI photo editing app, has gone viral for its AI Yearbook feature, which delivers 60 different images of a person using eight to 12 of their submitted selfies. The AI-generated photos showcase different hair styles, outfits and poses. While the app is free to download, it costs between $5.99 to $9.99 (but as of Tuesday afternoon, it was discounted at $3.99 and $5.99) to access the photos. It's become the latest AI trend to captivate the internet. Once users are able to access the app, they can upload their selfies into the program, select their gender and pay for either \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cexpress\u201d delivery. Standard wait times are up to 24 hours, while the express option delivers the photos in under two hours. Some are being prompted to try using the app later, due to the high volume of people trying out the feature.  Influencers like beauty guru Bretman Rock, YouTuber Hila Klein and Twitch streamer Pokimane are using the app to create \u201890s-inspired school photos. Actress Keke Palmer also hopped on the trend. \u201cIdk y\u2019all.. I feel like mine ain\u2019t me fr,\u201d Palmer wrote in an Instagram caption, alongside images of her yearbook self. The app generates headshots and full body images in front of mostly solid backgrounds. Some of the photos are categorized into high school superlatives such as \u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d or \u201cMost Musical.\u201d The quality of the photos, which seamlessly combine facial traits from the images provided, has viewers impressed \u2014 and nervous. Some believe the images prove that AI is becoming increasingly convincing. \u201cAre these real or AI???? Huge slay. I\u2019m obsessed with the first,\u201d a fan wrote under Klein\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cAI stuff is getting too crazy,\u201d one commenter wrote under Pokimane\u2019s AI yearbook photos.  Others felt that their photos were less realistic than they expected. Rock said in his Instagram caption that he paid for the service twice. The results were not what he envisioned.  \u201cYalll I\u2019m DYING \u2026 who are these people,\u201d Rock wrote. But some critics of the app have warned about potential data privacy issues. As interest in AI photography has grown, so have broader concerns over safety, privacy and ethics among data experts, with some arguing that the images could be used to compile user data. The popularity of photo apps like Epik, as well as last year's viral Lensa app, has also spurred discussion over the ethics of creating images with models that have been trained using other people\u2019s original work.  In an X post, writer Franchesca Ramsey urged people to stop participating in the yearbook trend because the selfies can be used to train AI programs moving forward. \u201cPeople paying to train AI w their pics is\u2026bad. there are serious legal & ethical concerns. AI plagiarizes from artists & is actively putting ppl out of work. folks are passing around fake images to deceive ppl & the tech is getting better bc of your high school pic trend,\u201d she wrote on X. A spokesperson for SNOW Corporation, the parent company of Epik, said in an email on Thursday that \"The EPIK app does not store any personal information, including selfies, that is used to create AI yearbook results.\" \"This information is also provided to users of the EPIK app in the app\u2019s privacy policy,\" the spokesperson said.

        "content": "Norwegian writer Jon Fosse won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday, for plays and prose that \u201cgive voice to the unsayable,\u201d according to the Swedish Academy. One of his country\u2019s most-performed dramatists, Fosse, 64, has written some 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children\u2019s books, poetry and essays. Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel literature committee, said Fosse\u2019s work is rooted \u201cin the language and nature of his Norwegian background.\u201d Mats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy who announced the prize, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win. He said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully. Fosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to get the Nobel. Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson got it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928. His work \u201cA New Name: Septology VI-VII\u201d \u2014 described by Olsson as Fosse\u2019s \u201cmagnum opus\u201d \u2014 was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2022. The Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by their creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December. Last year, French author Annie Ernaux won the prize for what the prize-giving Swedish Academy called \u201cthe courage and clinical acuity\u201d of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France. Ernaux was just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated. In 2018, the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, which names the Nobel literature committee, and sparked an exodus of members. The academy revamped itself but faced more criticism for giving the 2019 award to Austria\u2019s Peter Handke, who has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes. ",

        "title": "A jack-o'-lantern named Lewis is this year's viral Halloween icon",
        "content": "Halloween has a new mascot and his name is Lewis. The jack-o'-lantern, which is being sold at Target and is designed by Hyde and Eek Boutique, has become this season's most coveted Halloween decoration item, following in the footsteps of items like the iconic 12-foot Home Depot skeleton and the viral \"Stranger Things\" floating Max sculpture. But it's more than just looks. The jack-o'-lantern, which sits atop a ghoulish body draped in tattered black robes, also speaks. \"I am not a jack-o'-lantern,\" he is heard saying in videos across TikTok. \"My name is Lewis.\" Videos of the decoration have racked up millions of views on the platform, including one video that has been viewed more than 8.1 million times. The TikTok hashtag \"#MyNameIsLewis\" had been viewed more than 18.5 million times as of Wednesday afternoon. A spokesperson for Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decoration's virality or how many have sold. Currently, Target's website lists the 8-foot Light and Sound Pumpkin Halloween Ghoul, which costs $180, as sold out. Lewis stans have posted TikToks of themselves visiting their local Target's in order to run into a \"celebrity.\" Others have made fan art featuring Lewis. One person even made a Lewis Halloween costume. The band Smashing Pumpkins even got in on the fun. In a TikTok, the group joked it would rename the band \"The Lewis Pumpkins.\" One Target location even appeared to give the decoration a name tag. (In this video, the jack-o-lantern's name is spelled \"Louie.\") He\u2019s Halloween\u2019s Paddington Bear. -SHANNON MURPHY, WHO WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO POST ABOUT LEWIS ON TIKTOK Shannon Murphy, 26, is believed to be the first person to post a video of Lewis, according to meme database Know Your Meme. A video she posted on Sept. 27 of the decoration uttering its now-famous phrase has more than 2 million views. Murphy said she was walking through her local Huntington Beach, California, Target when she heard the decoration utter the \"Lewis\" line from a few aisles over. She filmed the clip of the line and posted it to her TikTok, not expecting it would take off with a viral life of its own. The viral line has become so iconic because it's \"almost theater of the absurd,\" she said. But she's still had to explain why it's so funny to her parents. She said her mother is still wondering, \"Who is Lewis?\" \"It's breaking people's brains,\" she joked. \"But, at this point, with everyone being on the internet, all of our senses of humor are a little bit broken.\" Broken brains aside, Murphy said the decoration has served as a nice break on the internet, which can often be oversaturated with upsetting images and heavy news. \"It's so wholesome in its silliness,\" she said, adding, \"He's Halloween's Paddington Bear.\" Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "title": "Travis Kelce says NFL is 'overdoing it a little bit' with Taylor Swift coverage",
        "content": "Taylor Swift fans were buzzing this past weekend when the 12-time Grammy Award winner attended the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 matchup against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. But were football fans just as into it? Anyone who watched NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d game Oct. 1 likely noticed the multitude of camera shots featuring Swift cheering on her rumored beau, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce brought it up to his brother on this week\u2019s episode of their podcast, \u201cNew Heights,\u201d saying, \u201cIt seemed like the cameras were more interested in potentially the patrons of the game than the people playing.\u201d Swift wasn\u2019t the only celebrity in attendance. The music icon brought along a star-studded group, including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Sophie Turner. Hugh Jackman, Sabrina Carpenter and Antoni Porowski were also seen at the stadium. Following the camera shots on the box seats and the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d ad featuring Swift\u2019s hit \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d Jason Kelce eventually asked the question circling the internet: Is the NFL overdoing it? \u201cTake away your feelings for Taylor,\u201d Jason Kelce told his brother as the tight end laughed. \u201cWhat is your honest opinion on how the NFL is treating celebrities at games?\u201d Travis Kelce responded that he finds it fun when the league shows which stars are at the game, adding that he thinks \u201cit brings a little bit more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you\u2019re watching.\u201d But as he starts to give a counterpoint, Jason Kelce interrupts to say, \u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it,\u201d to which his brother agrees: \u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it a little bit, especially with my situation.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re just trying to have fun with it,\u201d Travis Kelce added. Jason Kelce theorized that the NFL is \u201cjust not used to celebrities coming to the games,\u201d as opposed to other leagues like the NBA. \u201cLike, basketball has it figured out. They\u2019re all courtside, they\u2019re sitting there,\u201d he said of celebrities at NBA games. \u201cThey show them once or twice, but then they get back to the game.\u201d Jason Kelce then asked his brother another question that was on fans\u2019 minds during Sunday\u2019s game: \u201cDude, how many commercials have you done?\u201d Through laughter, the Chiefs player said, \u201cYeah, we racked it up in the offseason,\u201d adding that at least one to two more commercials are in the works. Some football players don\u2019t seem too bothered by the Swift-Kelce coverage. On last week\u2019s podcast episode, Jason Kelce asked Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones if he thought the team\u2019s defensive line was getting enough credit these days. \u201cWell, when you think about it, when we have f------ Pat Mahomes and Travis Kelce on offense scoring so many damn points, and we got Taylor Swift at the game, who gives a damn about the defense, bro?\u201d he joked. Swifties and football fans alike can\u2019t deny the increased viewership for the NFL. Sunday\u2019s broadcast averaged 27 million viewers, according to NBC Sports, making it the most-watched Sunday program since the Super Bowl aired in February. Compared to the first three weeks of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d ratings for this past weekend\u2019s game were up 53% for girls ages 12 to 17, 24% for women between the ages of 18 and 24, and 34% for women over 35, NBC Sports reported, citing Nielsen data. \u201cThe collective growth resulted in an approximate viewership increase of more than two million female viewers,\u201d NBC Sports said. Though a close matchup, the Chiefs earned a win over the Jets, 23-20, on the New York team\u2019s home turf.  ",

        "title": "A national honor recognizes Tejano music legend and pioneer Little Joe",
        "content": "By the time he was 15, Tejano music pioneer Joe \u201cLittle Joe\u201d DeLe\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez had taken a stance to pick the guitar instead of cotton. He was amazed to make $5 on his first paying gig \u2014 he would have had to pick 500 pounds of cotton to earn that \u2014 and he never looked back.  More than 62 years later, \"King of the Brown Sound\" on Friday received the National Heritage Fellowship Award from the National Endowment of the Arts, the highest national award that honors the artistic genius of traditional artists \u201cat the intersection of past, present and future and at the intersection of preservation and innovation,\u201d according to NEA Chair Maria Rosario Jackson.  It's a fitting tribute to the Mexican American music legend, who has recorded more than 70 albums and won four Grammys and a Latin Grammy (from a combined 11 nominations) and who was named the Texas State Artist of the Year in 2019. Little Joe is credited with putting Tejano, or Tex-Mex, music on the map. It\u2019s a pioneering Chicano sound that's an up-tempo hybrid of the many genres he grew up hearing in both Spanish and English: Mexican conjunto norte\u00f1o, country, blues, rock, big band, cumbia, merengue and more. He has also opened doors and influenced other artists \u2014 including the late singing legend Selena \u2014 and he has been a symbol of activism and civil rights. Little Joe's iconic song \"Las Nubes\" is considered an anthem for the farmworker movement, which he has supported among other causes, including Farm Aid, where he performed with Willie Nelson. Among his other well-known songs are \"Por Un Amor,\" \"Margarita,\" \"Prieta Linda\" and \"Redneck Meskin Boy.\" The King of the Brown Sound was born Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda DeLe\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez on a thunderous stormy night in a three-walled dirt floor garage where his family lived in Temple, Texas, on Oct. 17, 1940. He was the seventh of 13 children born to Salvador and Amelia De Leon Hern\u00e1ndez, and his first piercing cry is fondly remembered by his older brother Jim Hern\u00e1ndez as a little \u201cgrito,\u201d or yell, \u201cnaturally going along with the storm,\u201d as detailed in Little Joe's 2020 authorized biography, \u201c\u00a1No Llore Ching\u00f3n! An American Story, The Life of Little Joe.\u201d A \"grito,\" a powerful, emotive cry or yell that's popular in Mexican music, is one of the hallmarks of Little Joe\u2019s live shows and many of his songs. Music was a family affair for the Hern\u00e1ndezes. They knew poverty, but they were rich in culture. Little Joe\u2019s cousin David Coronado had already brought him into his band, David Coronado and The Latinaires. His younger brother Jesse Hern\u00e1ndez joined after their first recording in 1958, followed by even more Hern\u00e1ndez brothers, Johnny and Rocky. After Coronado left, the band became Little Joe and The Latinaires through the 1960s and changed again to Little Joe y La Familia in the \u201970s.  NBC News caught up with Little Joe over a celebratory breakfast with friends at Chevy\u2019s Mexican Restaurant in Arlington, Virginia, for a look into his life and music and the making of an unlikely and uniquely American international phenomenon. Below is a condensed and edited version of the conversation. What do you think about this new wave of regional Mexican music like Peso Pluma, Grupo Frontera and others? \u201cEach generation brings their own mix to the table. I\u2019m always happy to see innovation in music. It\u2019s a way to express one\u2019s emotions, ra\u00edz, cultura, so the new music that we hear now on the Latino side, I think it\u2019s great that we have it. From there, others will learn and develop their own music.\u201d You signed with other labels, but you also created your own labels, Buena Suerte Records for Spanish and Good Luck Records for English. How did that work out for you? \u201cIn 1968 I was offered a contract with Capitol \u2026 and just the first paragraph of it said they would control everything and own everything. I had just started my [own] record company, and I wanted to produce the music that I\u2019d produced through the years. There weren\u2019t any outlets for Chicano music that was like my band [or] record labels to record my style of music, so I went independent. I produced my own recordings of my group and produced some 20, 25 bands. \u201cI understood the promotion and distribution \u2026 that if they didn\u2019t do it for me I would do it myself. I learned how to put a group together, get the music, go into the studio, record it, then produce the music and have the albums pressed and the distribution and the promotion. The hard part came when the time came to collect.\u201d (He smiles.)     How has your life informed your music? \u201cMy dad and brothers and sisters were all musicians, played instruments, wrote songs, and they all sang. ... I had the advantage as a kid to learn so many great, beautiful songs, profound lyrics, haunting melodies. Every time I put out one of those songs, the acceptance was great. The song \u2018Por Un Amor\u2019 was an incredible hit for me, and then later on I re-recorded it into an album. And [it] went national and then went to Mexico and South America.  \u201cBut it\u2019s [about] the deliverance; we all need rice and beans and tortillas, but it\u2019s how they\u2019re prepared, you know? Same thing with music, the arrangements of the song and, above all, the sentimiento [feeling], the feeling that we convey to people. \u201cI had soooo much material even before I started writing my own. I grew up listening to the big band era, the crooners, the swing bands. So in my music you have those overtones. In \u2018Por Un Amor\u2019 you hear the rock and roll; in \u2018Cuando Salgo A Los Campos\u2019 you hear the country; in \u2018Qu\u00e9 Culpa Tengo\u2019 you hear the jazz. \u2018Ella\u2019 is a mariachi song, a Mexican ranchera, but I feel it as a blues song, because I grew up with the blues, so that\u2019s the way I delivered it. \u2018Prieta Linda\u2019 [is] slow, laid-back blues.\u201c You\u2019re a little humble about your singing talent. You\u2019re a very passionate and dramatic singer; I think your audiences love that. And I don\u2019t know anyone who can belt out gritos like you do!    \"Music is magic! Music is the only art form that can make a 10-month-old baby stand up and dance or a 90 year-old, because es algo del alma, something from the soul. It takes a level of talent to deliver [music], to produce it, but the feeling \u2014 that\u2019s different. I\u2019m able to deliver that feeling. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a great musician \u2014 maybe a great conduit to the heart and soul of the people. \u201cAnd a grito es un sentimiento [feeling], you know? Ouch! It hurts so good.\u201d (He chuckles.) \u201cIt just feels so good. And to be able to convey that to the souls of other people, that\u2019s my gift.\u201d What were some of the significant moments in your career? \u201cThe death of my younger brother [Jesse], who played bass in the group with me. He died in a car accident at the age of 20 [in 1964]. ... He actually got me to quit my day job and really concentrate on booking the band. He foresaw this for me. \u2026 [When] we were having problems with a drummer, he said: \u2018Joe, don\u2019t worry about that. When you make a name for yourself, you\u2019re gonna have musicians getting in line wanting to play for you.\u2019 \u201cWhen Jesse died I promised him that I would take the music to the top, whatever the top is, and I would stay with it, no matter what. I\u2019ve seen others give up. \u2026 I was not about to quit. I made that promise to him.\u201d  What do think Jesse would be saying to you now? \u201cI told you!\u201d  You\u2019re also a role model as a migrant farmworker.  \u201cIt was a really difficult time, but I came from something really special: my dad and mom, esa sangre [that blood], fighters, tough people, you know, hard-working people with good hearts. And I can say that for all my brothers and sisters.  \u201cMusic has taken me all over Europe, all over Japan, parts of Mexico and all over the United States, but more importantly it\u2019s given me the podium to speak to issues of the communities. And that\u2019s what keeps me going. That energizes me, [being] able to speak on behalf of people that can\u2019t speak for themselves. That\u2019s part of what I\u2019m supposed to do. \u201cFamilia means everything to me. Not just my family \u2026 or the musicians working with me. We\u2019re just human. It really doesn\u2019t matter where we come from. It\u2019s what we do for one another.\u201d  Marisa Arbona-Ruiz is an Emmy Award-winning producer, journalist, actor, and musician who can be found breaking into song and dance on random concert stages.

        "title": "MrBeast calls TikTok ad showing an AI version of him a 'scam'",
        "content": "YouTube star MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is asking if social media platforms are prepared to deal with fake AI ads after a scam advertisement on TikTok featured a deepfake of him offering $2 iPhones. \"Lots of people are getting this deepfake scam ad of me ... are social media platforms ready to handle the rise of AI deepfakes? This is a serious problem,\" Donaldson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Donaldson directed NBC News to the post. Deepfakes are a type of artificial media in which a person's face is replaced with someone else's. The technology has grown more sophisticated, making deepfake images and video harder to spot. The ad has since been removed from TikTok. A spokesperson for the platform declined to comment, but referred NBC News to its advertising policies, which state that \u201cSynthetic or manipulated media showing realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed or labeled in the video.\" Although the MrBeast ad is imperfect \u2014 there are lip-sync errors at times, in which the way the mouth moves isn't synchronized with what is being said \u2014 it underscores the ever-increasing realism AI offers, and how deceptive it is becoming. Donaldson joins a handful of other well-known people who have warned that their likeness is being used without their permission. On Sunday, the actor Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that he had \"nothing to do with\" a computer-generated image of himself \"promoting some dental plan.\" Also this week, Zelda Williams, the daughter of the late actor/comedian Robin Williams, called the AI recreations of him circulating the internet \u201cpersonally disturbing.\u201d AI also remains a sticking point in the negotiations with the Hollywood studios in the ongoing strike by the actors union, SAG-AFTRA. The MrBeast ad shows an AI version of Donaldson, shoulders up, in a pink hoodie and gray baseball cap. In the video, a voice, which does not sound like Donaldson, said that a limited number of people will be eligible for the supposed giveaway. \"If you\u2019re watching this video, you\u2019re one of the 10,000 lucky people who will get an iPhone 15 Pro for just $2,\" the voice says in the video. \"I\u2019m MrBeast and I\u2019m doing the world\u2019s largest iPhone 15 giveaway. Click the link below to claim yours now.\" The video also displayed Donaldson's logo and a username with a verified checkmark in the lower lefthand corner, where a real verified username would typically appear. The linked page showed an image that is made to look like it's from Donaldson's Instagram account advertising the giveaway. However, no such posts appear on Donaldson's verified Instagram account page. A reverse image search on Google shows the image that appeared in the alleged Instagram post was originally used as a thumbnail in a video by YouTuber ZHC. The video, titled \"I Surprised MrBeast With Custom iPhones!\" has more than 37 million views. At the top of the page, a counter supposedly shows the dwindling number of iPhones still available. The page asked users to verify they are over 18 and displays several \"satisfied customers\" with the iPhones they are purported to have won.

        "content": "Jimmy Butler\u2019s new \u201cemo\u201d hairdo is the internet\u2019s latest obsession. The Miami Heat player, 34, arrived to media day on Monday with straightened hair, painted fingernails and piercings \u2014 the second year in a row he chose the event to unveil a new look for the season.  \u201cYeah, yeah, laugh it up,\u201d he told the room of snickering reporters. He added: \u201cI\u2019m very emotional right now. This is my emo state and I like this. This is me,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThis is how I\u2019m feeling as of late.\u201d With Butler rocking this look on media day, which is when players talk to reporters and take official headshots, his emo style will be featured in promotional photos all throughout the upcoming NBA season. Social media users quickly noticed Butler\u2019s new look and couldn\u2019t help but equate his hairstyle to that of emo bands of the early 2000s \u2014 like Secondhand Serenade, Fall Out Boy, and Panic! at the Disco.  One post on X, formerly Twitter, featured several shots of Butler\u2019s hair and an emoji meme of the infamous emo black hair swoop. It simply read: Cuz tonight will be the night that I will ball for yewwww,\u201d a play on the lyrics to Secondhand Serenade\u2019s 2008 hit \u201cFall For You.\u201d  Another poster shared Butler\u2019s official headshot, writing, \u201cNot he went and got that\u2026  \u2018CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES; THIS IS MY LAST RESORT.\u2019\u201d On Instagram, one user edited Butler\u2019s head into the music video for \u201cOutkast\u2019s Hey Ya!,\u201d in which rapper Andre 3000 rocks a short silk press. And the hairdresser responsible for Butler\u2019s new look shared a behind-the-scenes clip of her straightening the athlete\u2019s hair with Fall Out Boy\u2019s \u201cThnks fr th Mmrs\u201d playing in the background.  The internet has affectionately called Butler everything from \u201cHeat Wentz\u201d and \u201cBall Out Boy\u201d to \u201cPanic! At the Free Throw.\u201d Butler is seemingly fond of shaking up his looks regularly. He donned dreadlocks at last year\u2019s media day and kept them  for months, but ultimately decided that the long hairstyle may interfere with his game, so he removed them ahead of the Heat\u2019s first preseason game, according to the Ringer. It\u2019s unclear how long Butler will keep his hair straightened, but social media users have some ideas. \u201cJimmy Butler gon sweat his press out before the end of the first quarter,\u201d one person posted on X.  Internet users weren\u2019t the only ones shocked by Butler\u2019s latest stunt. Heat center Bam Adebayo told reporters that he hadn\u2019t seen Butler in person before the day began and thought the straightened hair photos were edited with Photoshop.  \u201cThat is not real!\u201d Adebayo said, calling the look \u201chilarious.\u201d Char Adams is a reporter for NBC BLK who writes about race.

Paramount Pictures uploaded the film onto the app Tuesday after launching its official \u201cMean Girls\u201d TikTok account last month.

A spokesperson for the studio did not immediately respond to request for comment. As studios increasingly recognize the value of teasing their content on TikTok, many have begun uploading short movie and TV clips to the app. But in recent months, TikTok users have popularized uploading full movies to the short-form video platform by splicing them up several minutes at a time \u2014 and Paramount is the first major production company to take advantage of that trend.

Nicks, whose powerful voice has enthralled audiences for decades with Fleetwood Mac and in her own solo career, unveiled Mattel\u2019s Music Collector Series Barbie doll on social media Sunday.

        "title": "TikTok users help pediatric cancer patient get the star treatment at Disney World",
        "content": "Drew Patchin, 10, was excited to attend a Halloween party during his September visit to Disney World. But his family had an even bigger wish: Treat Patchin, who has has ependymoma, a rare kind of brain tumor, and his supportive younger brother, Tyler, as if they were celebrities while at they were at the park. Thanks to one TikTok creator, the family\u2019s wish \u2014 which they first shared in a Facebook group for people going to the park\u2019s event \u2014 went viral and came true. Patchin has been battling cancer since 2019 and has undergone multiple surgeries to extract recurring tumors in his brain. His most recent tumor, which was discovered in February, had spread to his brain stem, rendering it partially inoperable. Drew and Tyler\u2019s mother, Jennifer Patchin, 42, said doctors told the family to \"go make memories and travel\" while they looked into more clinical trials for the tumor. The family, including aunt Debbie Schultz, Jennifer\u2019s sister, wanted to give Drew and Tyler the celebrity treatment so that they felt special. They had no idea that Kristen Sotakoun, 33, known as notkahnjunior on TikTok, would see Schultz's post. Sotakoun, who has 1.1 million followers on TikTok, shared the family's request on her page. She called on Disney World cast members to play along. The video has received 1.4 million views. \"This is the easiest way to make magic ever, right? There is no effort required from anybody, really. And it could make such a big impact,\" Sotakoun said of her decision to share the family's story. The video had a significant and shocking impact, Schultz said. She said that, in less than 10 minutes after arriving at the park, Drew was approached by a cast member for an autograph. She said the family was then stopped every 15 minutes by people who recognized Drew and Tyler. Patchin said the kids were so excited by the attention and that the experience was \"magical.\" \u201cIt was over seven hours of people making a big deal over them and going, \u2018Oh my gosh! You\u2019re famous, I get to see you. I\u2019ve been waiting for you. I\u2019m so glad I got to see you.\u2019 And then snapping selfies with them or giving them a sticker,\u201d she said. Social media users who weren't at the park that evening shared their support for the kids by joining the Facebook group for Drew's cancer journey and sharing encouraging messages, Patchin said. Sotakoun posted a follow-up video showing photos of the family. The TikTok received 6.7 million views and thousands of comments. Sotakoun, who is a former Disney World cast member, said that most of the support stemmed from social media, rather than her connections at the park. \"This was completely the result of TikTok and completely the result of sharing on social media. I didn't ask my personal friends for any special treatment. This is 100% organically the power of people coming together on social media and having one goal of kindness,\" Sotakoun said. The small acts of kindness that the family has received since their story went viral have made a big impact, Patchin said. \"Pediatric cancer families go through really hard stuff and something like this can make such a difference in our mindset and attitude. We're trying to make memories, have a special time together and stay helpful and positive. And this, both the night as it was happening and those reactions online, really make a difference in helping us in the fight,\" Patchin said.

        "title": "Mexican paletas are a growing craze \u2014 and here's why almost all stores share one name",
        "content": "ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014  Growing up in Mexico, Ruben Jim\u00e9nez learned how to make paletas from scratch, helping his dad and grandpa, who were paleteros, make and sell the popular frozen popsicles at their store or in carts.    Jim\u00e9nez, 35, has turned the modest family tradition into a sprawling Mexican paleta empire: \u201cLa Michoacana Plus\u201d has more than 85 franchises across the U.S. in California, Arizona, Texas, Oregon, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi \u2014 and his vibrant shops featuring over 100 popsicle flavors and more than 50 ice cream flavors can be found as far away as Guatemala and even in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where he opened the country\u2019s first paleter\u00eda last year and is planning to open a second one. In a country known for its heat and where people don't drink alcohol but love sweets, the paletas have been a hit, Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cIf we opened in Dubai, I believe we can open in any part of the world,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez, who currently lives in Bakersfield, California, and whose business now has over 5,000 employees. \u201cLa Michoacana is now a differentiator to recognize Mexico and its popsicles and ice cream.\u201d  Jim\u00e9nez and many others in the paleta business are banking on the Michoac\u00e1n name\u2019s instant recognition and the storied history behind it: Despite some debate and varying claims, the Mexican state is known as the birthplace of paletas and one of its towns, Tocumbo, has a giant paleta monument and hosts a weeklong yearly paleta festival. Like many other paleta shop owners across the U.S., though, Jim\u00e9nez doesn\u2019t hail from Michoac\u00e1n. He was born in Nochistl\u00e1n, in the state of Zacatecas, and was raised in Toluca.  Yet for Jim\u00e9nez and others, his store's name was an obvious choice. \u201cWhen I first named the shop 'La Michoacana Plus,' I was trying to find a name that historically represented the genesis of the paletas of Mexico. My objective was to bring the typical products of my country,\u201d Jimenez said. Paletas with the name \"Michoacana\" have reached the U.S. mainstream and are sold in general supermarkets like Walmart, Smart & Final and Costco, among others. You can find a Michoacana paleter\u00eda from coast to coast and in-between, including in the Midwest, where there\u2019s a strong Latino presence. In Mexico alone, it was estimated there were 30,000 paleter\u00edas over a decade ago; there's even been legal disputes over the use of the name, as Eater reported in 2019. But in her 2011 book \u201cPaletas,\u201d Mexican chef and food writer Fany Gerson, who owns La NewYorkina, a paleter\u00eda in Brooklyn, wrote, \u201cArguing that La Michoacana is a brand, it\u2019s like saying ice cream is a brand.\u201d  Serena Maria Daniels wrote in Eater, \u201cPeople use the phrase \u2018La Michoacana\u2019 as shorthand for a paleter\u00eda or ice cream shop in much the same way that people use the brand name Kleenex to mean facial tissue.\u201d For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. In Mexico, paletas \u2014 some of them homemade \u2014 are commonplace and are sold from pushcarts or in shops or paleter\u00edas. Making and selling the frozen treats have allowed families a path toward economic mobility without any formal education or capital. As Gerson describes in her book, the word \"paleta\u201d derives from the Spanish word palo, which means stick. The popsicles are typically water or dairy-based and come in a variety of fruit and other flavors; they can include other ingredients such as fresh fruit chunks and condiments to provide texture. Alberto Lezama Carrasco, a New York City native, was on vacation in Los Angeles when he noticed there was an unusual amount of paleter\u00edas in the region \u2014 all with the namesake of Michoacana. He took the business concept to the Big Apple and opened up La Michoacana NYC in Brooklyn last year. It\u2019s become an instant hit, attracting people from different parts of New York City and surrounding states: He said customers drive a few hours from as far as Pennsylvania, upstate New York and Connecticut to buy his products. \u201cPeople say, \u2018There\u2019s a Michoacana?\u2019 and get surprised,\u201d said Carrasco, 38, referring to the fact there's not as many Michoacanas in New York City as in Los Angeles, Chicago or Mexico. He said people who travel the farthest are mostly Hispanic: \"a lot of Mexicans, Central Americans, like people from El Salvador and Honduras,\" he said. Like Jim\u00e9nez, Carrasco isn\u2019t from Michoac\u00e1n. He\u2019s from Tlacotepec de Benito Ju\u00e1rez, in the state of Puebla. He cranks out up to 5,000 paletas on a given day, depending on demand and orders. Apart from his own business, he distributes paletas and ice cream to local delis and bodegas. Some workdays he begins molding batches of paletas and prepping dozens of ice cream buckets at 8 a.m. and finishes around midnight. \u201cLife in Mexico is much different,\u201d said Carrasco, who grew up poor and unable to afford his own paleta; he had to share a popsicle with family members. \u201cNow I\u2019m the one making the ice cream,\u201d he said. \u201cKids have come here and asked if they could buy ice cream for $1,\u201d Carrasco said, which reminds him of his memories growing up in Mexico. \u201cI say \u2018it\u2019s OK\u2019 and give them ice cream.\u201d With the widespread number of Michoacanas, competition has spurred store owners to get creative with unique flavors to differentiate their establishments. They've added popular Mexican snacks, or antojitos, to their menu, built more elaborate and eye-catching storefronts and posted their products online to draw customers. In Haines City, Florida, Fernanda Contreras, 26, started La Michoacana Natural with her boyfriend and his family in 2019. They\u2019ve quickly expanded by adding three more shops in the region.  \u201cThere is obviously always an option of just branding it your own and not calling it a Michoacana, but we wanted to try it out. I feel like myself when I hear Michoacana, I just know exactly what they sell,\u201d said Contreras, who is Mexican American and grew up in Chicago seeing Michoacanas all over the place. \u201cPeople just knew immediately too, like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a Michoacana.\u2019 They know what we sell. They know what they\u2019re coming for, what they\u2019re going to find.\u201d Contreras said their stores offer traditional paleta and ice cream flavors found across most Michoacanas, like lime, coconut and fresas con crema \u2014 strawberries and cream. But it hasn\u2019t stopped them from experimenting. Every month or so they create a new flavor. They\u2019ve previously made vanilla paletas filled with Nutella that oozes out once it's bitten into and a gummy bear paleta, among other confections. Like most Michoacanas, which also serve as a sort of candy store, La Michoacana Natural features popular Mexican snacks and trendy items, like mini pancakes. \u201cWe sell a crazy amount of mini pancakes, people love them \u2014 we have churros and obviously the big item that everybody looks for is tostilocos,\u201d said Contreras, referring to the popular Mexican street snack made with Tostitos, vegetables, hot sauce, nuts and other ingredients. \u201cGrowing up, though, I don\u2019t remember seeing a lot of antojitos (snacks) to be honest with you \u2014 at least not in Mexico. It was mainly known for ice cream, paletas [and] aguas frescas\" (water infused with fruit and citrus). As Michoacana menus have grown and diversified over the years, Contreras said paletas and ice cream remain top sellers at their shops, but antojitos do help drive customers to their locations and to other Michoacanas nationwide.  \u201cIt can be overwhelming when people come and just assume they\u2019re all the same, that they offer the same and they expect the same,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cEverybody just kind of puts their own touch to the mold and changes little things here and there. And it\u2019s cool to bring a little piece of Mexico to every [U.S.] state because you could really find them almost everywhere now.\u201d  In Southern California, Jennifer Clausen-Quiroz, 36, and her brother Ricardo Quiroz, 31, have been managing Tocumbo Ice Cream in Anaheim since 2016. Tocumbo is also a common name for paleter\u00edas, according to Gerson\u2019s book, along with La Michoacana and La Flor de Michoac\u00e1n on either side of the border. \u201cIn Mexico, you don\u2019t even need to be from Tocumbo, not even from Michoac\u00e1n to open up a Michoacana,\" Quiroz said. \"Usually if you open up a Michoacana it means you went to Michoac\u00e1n to learn how to make paletas, how to make ice cream and over there it\u2019s common.\" The Quiroz family is from Cotija de la Paz, a city next to Tocumbo. Their uncle Gerardo Ram\u00edrez opened up paleter\u00edas originally with the namesake Michoacana in San Diego more than 20 years ago, but later renamed them after Tocumbo since people also associate it with paletas. Clausen-Quiroz recalled her father\u2019s stories of growing up near Tocumbo. He would say \"if you were trying to impress a lady or something, you would take her to Tocumbo for some ice cream,\u201d she said. Aside from the store in Anaheim, the family has four other locations in San Diego, and they strive to stay authentic by sourcing ingredients locally and importing items from Mexico. Because of the exposure Michoacanas have received, Clausen-Quiroz said customers assume their business is affiliated with a Michoacana brand and expect certain flavors, prices and quality.  \u201cPeople just assume that we\u2019re a Michoacana and that we are franchise and that we buy from the same supplier.\u201d Though that's not the case, it\u2019s not all bad. She said the exposure has made paletas and Mexican ice cream mainstream. \u201cPeople that are not Hispanic or Mexican can say, hey, like, \u2018I understand. I know what a paleta is, \u2018You don\u2019t have to tell me it\u2019s a popsicle.' Or they understand that our ice cream, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s good ice cream, it\u2019s not going to be something that we buy from a wholesaler,\u201d Clausen-Quiroz said. \u201cWe have some pretty good diehard fans that are good at, like, word of mouth,\u201d Clausen-Quiroz said. Los Angeles Times columnist Gustavo Arellano said Tocumbo was his favorite restaurant. Clausen-Quiroz said they regularly get customers who drive from other parts of the state or recurring tourists from nearby Disneyland. One customer drove from Las Vegas for his paletas \u2014 they sent him off with dry ice to make it back home. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people from like the U.K. and, like, places in Canada that have just heard about us,\" Clausen-Quiroz said, \"or they have family members that live here that, you know, they make it a point to make it a stop.\" In New York, Carrasco reflected on the frozen treat and the popular name used by store owners like him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a blessing to have this business concept in Mexico and to bring it over here to the U.S. and other parts of the world, because in reality, people are very content,\" he said. \"I believe that it doesn\u2019t only signify Mexicans, but people from all over the world, love the products from la Michoacanas.\" Edwin Flores reports and produces for NBC Latino and is based in Anaheim, California.

        "title": "The 'girlfriend effect': TikTok is debating whether dating women gives men fashion glow-ups",
        "content": "Hundreds of couples on TikTok are showing off what they describe as the \u201cgirlfriend effect\u201d \u2014 how men seem to upgrade their fashion sense under the influence of their girlfriends. But some online are calling out the phenomenon, saying it\u2019s the latest example of people being pushed toward the same \u201ctrendy\u201d minimalist aesthetic they feel pressured to tout on their social media pages. The so-called effect has emerged as the antithesis to a phenomenon facetiously referred to as \u201cboyfriend air,\u201d wherein a woman begins dating a man and glows \u201cdown\u201d instead of up. When a creator pointed out that the opposite happens for men, couples began responding with evidence of its occurring in their own relationships.  Videos using the hashtag #girlfriendeffect have amassed more than 11 million views on TikTok in the last seven days.  The trend began to gain traction this month when content creator Gabe Escobar, 21, racked up 3.5 million likes for sharing a series of photos depicting how his style has gradually evolved since he started dating his girlfriend more than a year ago.  \u201cAs a boy, I\u2019ve never really had people giving me advice on what to wear,\u201d Escobar said in a phone interview. \u201cEvery day, I see a lot of TikToks about girl fashion advice or \u2018get ready with me\u2019 or shopping hauls, but I see far fewer with guys\u2019 fashion, and I just genuinely had no idea what to wear.\u201d Now that he\u2019s in his first serious relationship, he said, Escobar feels like he has somebody who cares enough to give honest feedback and suggestions about his fashion sense. His girlfriend made him a Pinterest board of outfit ideas and, at his request, sent him a list of fashion staples \u2014 including jeans, khakis, polo shirts, rugby shirts and sweatshirts \u2014 to take to Rome for his semester abroad. His previous day-to-day attire usually involved wearing a cropped jersey and trousers held by a leather belt, paired with a few necklaces and a blue-gray satchel. These days, he wears loose button-ups, and he has grown out his hair, previously buzzed on the sides, to adopt a middle part. In comments on videos within the genre, some viewers applaud men\u2019s stylistic changes and the work their girlfriends must have put in.  But there are also many critics of the trend, who suggest that such men are suppressing their individual styles into one \u201cInstagrammable\u201d look. Some online have also pointed out in comments that pieces considered unfashionable now, like skinny jeans, were probably stylish years ago when many of the couples first met. Escobar said that while he is happy with his \u201cglow-up,\u201d he has noticed the homogeneity that comes with the trend. \u201cI think, in a lot of the examples, you can sort of see the outfits become relatively the same across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not what I look like. Maybe I ought to look at myself first before I pass any judgments.\u201d Wildlin Pierrevil, a content creator who largely shares cultural commentary on TikTok, posted a video critiquing the uniformity of many men\u2019s \u201cafter\u201d outfits compared to their starting outfits, which he said usually exhibited more of their individuality and included some styles that he actually really liked. Pierrevil said he recalls seeing a video of a man chronicling his outfits before and after having met his girlfriend, while his girlfriend harshly criticized his former outfits off-screen. As he scrolled, he said, he felt some of the videos were \u201cjust kind of mean.\u201d There\u2019s a difference, he said, between helping people develop their tastes and execute their own styles and asking them to abandon their personal styles in favor of their partners\u2019. \u201cBy forfeiting style, you can kind of present as someone who vaguely knows how to dress themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more difficult thing is to meet someone where they\u2019re at in terms of their identity expression and try to decode what it is they\u2019re trying to say with their fashion in order to help them better articulate it.\u201d For Escobar and others posting about their new looks, changing their looks wasn\u2019t about meeting a certain aesthetic. It was about finding what they feel best in. \u201cI never had a style that I had to abandon because my girlfriend was showing me new clothes,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have a style. And now I do.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "content": "Let's call it a mini stadium tour: Taylor Swift will again be at Travis Kelce\u2019s game this weekend, a source said. The music superstar will watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the New York Jets in New Jersey on Sunday night, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed Thursday. Representatives for Swift declined to comment. After days of rumors that the \u201cShake it Off\u201d singer was dating the Chiefs tight end, she blew up the internet \u2014 and most other forms of media \u2014 by showing up at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday. She not only sported a Chiefs jacket \u2014 she further fueled rumors by sitting next to Kelce\u2019s mother. Her attendance launched memes, drove massive sales of Kelce\u2019s jersey and spurred Swifties to mob Kansas City-area businesses she was rumored to have visited.  Though the two have not officially confirmed they are dating, a source close to Swift said they are indeed hanging out and getting to know each other.  Kelce spoke glowingly of Swift on his podcast this week, calling it \"ballsy\" of her to show up at his game in Kansas City. \u201cTo see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high-fives with Mom, to see how, you know, Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there,\u201d Kelce said on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. \u201cThat s--- was absolutely hysterical. It was definitely a game I will remember, that\u2019s for damn sure. Then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end,\u201d he said. Chloe Melas is an entertainment correspondent for NBC News.

        "title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce inspire viral prank on TikTok ",
        "content": "Did Taylor Swift put Travis Kelce on the map? That's the basis of the latest TikTok prank, in which people troll their football-loving partners by posting videos suggesting the pop star has made the Kansas City Chiefs tight end famous. (He\u2019s won two Super Bowls. And hosted NBC's \"Saturday Night Live.\")  The prank, which began after Swift was spotted at Sunday\u2019s Chiefs game, entails people secretly recording themselves telling their partners that Swift put Kelce on the map and that nobody knew who he was before the association with Swift. The reactions, mostly from boyfriends and husbands, have ranged from shock to outrage. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re kidding right?\u201d one partner asked in response.  \u201cBaby, that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d said another partner.  \u201cOh, my God, don\u2019t,\u201d another partner said. \u201cJust don\u2019t say that!\u201d It\u2019s unclear who started the trend \u2014 but as of Thursday, a search on TikTok shows that hundreds of people have participated. The NFL-Swiftie crossover had evolved into a bonding opportunity for couples, with some joking online that they are testing their relationships and others leaning into the fun of having their interests collide. Like many participants, Kelley Carrasquillo said she did know who Kelce was despite pretending otherwise.  Her husband, Luis Carrasquillo, said that\u2019s why he appears so shocked in their TikTok video, which has garnered over 5 million views. He said he \u201ccould have sworn\u201d that Kelley knew who Kelce was before pranking him. \u201cShe got a huge laugh out of the whole thing,\u201d Luis said.  Meanwhile, Kelley said she\u2019s inspired to watch football again. \u201cI think it\u2019s so fun because now we can do it as a family and my stepdaughter wants to watch it because Taylor Swift is involved,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cShe\u2019s never really been the sports girl at all, and now she\u2019s like, \u2018Do you guys want to watch the game next week?\u2019\u201d The prank also did actually inspire the couple, based in Austin, Texas, to have a serious conversation about the topic. Kelley pointed out that while the NFL is very American, Taylor Swift is a global sensation.  \u201cWhen you say football anywhere else in the world, people think soccer,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing him to a global scale and people around the world know who she is.\u201d Victoria Garrick Browne, a content creator, and her husband, Max Browne, a football analyst, who are both based in Los Angeles, said they could not be happier that their worlds are colliding. They did not take part in the prank, but the two have made several videos about Swift and Kelce since Sunday. Victoria has grown an audience of over 1 million TikTok followers with content geared around mental health, body image and sometimes Swift. Browne is a former college football player for the USC Trojans. The two went to Taylor's Eras Tour stop in Los Angeles, where he dressed as \u201cthe scarf.\u201d  \u201cThese are two of the most exciting and dedicated fan bases,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cHe\u2019s watching every football game and very much in that world and so for them to truly come together at one time, it felt like time stopped for me and we just have been hyped about it.\u201d The prank circulating TikTok is \u201cthe perfect example of two opposite ends of the internet just colliding,\u201d Max added.  On one side you have the football \u201chardos,\u201d as Max likes to call them. \u201cTravis Kelce is in the conversation for the best tight end ever, but this whole thing goes to show how unaware so many football fans are of Taylor\u2019s star power,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the flip side, I also think it\u2019s somewhat refreshing that the Swifties are kind of like, \u2018Wait, who is this guy?\u2019\u201d Swifties can sometimes be looked down upon in a \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d kind of way, Victoria said.  \u201cIt\u2019s really funny to kind of role reverse and see how worked up some of these guys are getting. Some of them are like leaving and walking out of the room because they can\u2019t even handle this conversation and they\u2019re so worked up, insisting that he [Kelce] was already on the map\u201d before Taylor Swift. The TikTok trend may have been a joke, but Swift is undoubtedly bringing Kelce and the NFL to untapped audiences.  Sales of Kelce\u2019s jersey spiked nearly 400% after Swift was spotted at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium. The TikTok trend has seemingly even reached Kelce himself, who addressed Swift\u2019s appearance at Sunday\u2019s game on the podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which he co-hosts with his brother, Jason Kelce, a center for the Philadelphia Eagles.  \u201cHow does it feel that Taylor Swift put you on the map?\u201d Jason joked.  \u201cIt was definitely a game I will remember,\u201d Travis said. \u201cThen, we just slid off in the \u2018Getaway Car\u2019 at the end.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine Swift getting any bigger than she is right now, but NFL fans could be the last demographic she has left to conquer, according to Max, the football analyst. \u201cNot that Taylor needs any more fans, but I think if this continues, she\u2019s probably going to unlock a segment of the population that maybe was resistant to Taylor before,\u201d he said. Even the NFL has leaned in \u2014 its official TikTok account changed the league's bio to \u201c9/24/23. Taylor was here.\u201d Neither Kelce nor Swift have confirmed whether they are dating. A source close to Swift said this week that she and the Chiefs star are spending time together. ",

        "content": "Rapper Ice Spice broke her silence about Matty Healy's previous comments mocking her ethnicity, saying she was \"so confused\" by the remarks.

The podcast episode was pulled from Apple and Spotify after Healy\u2019s fans called the remarks racist.  \"When I had heard that little podcast or whatever, I was so confused,\" Ice Spice told Variety in an interview published Thursday. \"Because I heard \u2018chubby Chinese lady\u2019 or some s--- like that, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Huh? What does that even mean?\u2019 First of all, I\u2019m thick. What do you mean Chinese? What? But then they apologized or whatever. And the whole time, I didn\u2019t really care.\" The rapper said she saw Healy at a recent Jean Paul Gaultier party and they discussed the incident. \"He was like, \u2018Hey, you OK?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Of course.\u2019 He apologized to me a bunch of times. We\u2019re good,\" she said. A representative for Healy did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Ice Spice\u2019s recent remarks. On the podcast episode, Healy, who is white, described how he slid into Ice Spice\u2019s DMs and received no response. He can also be heard laughing at jokes that hosts Friedland and Nick Mullen make about Ice Spice\u2019s ethnicity (Ice Spice is Dominican and Nigerian). He appeared to encourage the co-hosts when they imitated Chinese and Hawaiian accents, and later laughed when the two imitated Japanese accents. In April, Healy publicly apologized to Ice Spice while performing in Auckland, New Zealand. \u201cI never meant to hurt anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve offended you and, like, Ice Spice, I\u2019m sorry.

        "content": "Authorities performed a wellness check on Britney Spears after fans expressed concern over a video of her dancing with knives, a source close to the singer told NBC News on Thursday. Spears, 41, is \"fine,\" the source said, adding: \"This is overblown. She was expressing her freedom as she continues to do.\" The \"Womanizer\" singer posted the video on Instagram on Monday, writing in the caption, \"I started playing in the kitchen with knives today.\" Spears added that fans shouldn't worry and that they weren't real knives. She posted again later saying she was simply copying Shakira, who danced with knives at her MTV Video Music Awards performance earlier this month. These types of videos are a staple on Spears' Instagram feed as she has posted clips of her dancing alone in her home for years. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fans called in a wellness check on Spears in January as well, which she said went a \"little too far\" in a since-deleted social media post. \"The police never entered my home and when they came to my gate they quickly realized there was no issue and left immediately,\" she wrote. \"This felt like I was being gaslit and bullied once the incident made it to the news and being portrayed once again in a poor and unfair light by the media.\" Chloe Melas is an entertainment correspondent for NBC News.

        "title": "Michael Gambon, actor who played Dumbledore in 'Harry Potter' films, dies at 82",
        "content": "Actor Michael Gambon, known for playing Professor Albus Dumbledore in multiple \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies has died, his family said in a statement Thursday. He was 82. \u201cWe are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon,\u201d said the statement issued on behalf of his wife, Anne, and son Fergus by publicist Clair Dobbs. It added that he \u201cdied peacefully in hospital\u201d after a bout of pneumonia with the pair at his bedside. \u201cWe ask that you respect our privacy at this painful time and thank you for your messages of support and love,\u201d it said. Born Oct. 19, 1940, in Dublin to a seamstress mother and an engineer father, Gambon left school at 15 and seven years later qualified as an engineer having completed his apprenticeship. But the lure of the stage, inspired by a local theater group, proved too strong, and he began to tread the boards professionally in the early 1960s. In 1962, the legendary Shakespearean actor Laurence Olivier made him one of the founding members of the National Theatre at London's Old Vic, alongside Derek Jacobi, Maggie Smith and other emerging greats. As Gambon built his reputation onstage, roles on TV and movies followed, including the lead role in 1986's widely acclaimed \u201cThe Singing Detective,\u201d in which he played a writer suffering from a debilitating skin condition whose imagination provided the only escape from his pain. It would make him a household name in Britain. Other notable roles included a psychotic mob leader in \u201cThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\u201d in 1989, the elderly King George V in \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d in 2010 and Lord Salisbury in 2017\u2019s \u201cVictoria & Abdul.\u201d He also had parts in director Wes Anderson comedy films \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u201d (2004) and \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d (2009). Frequently nominated for awards, he won the Olivier Award three times and the Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Award twice. He also won four British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards for his television work. He also won two ensemble cast Screen Actors Guild Awards \u2014 for 2001\u2019s \u201cGosford Park\u201d and \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d Gambon was knighted for his services to drama in 1998. But he was perhaps best known for his role as Dumbledore in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise, having taken over the role from the late Richard Harris beginning with the third installment in the eight-movie series. Although the role raised Gambon\u2019s international profile and introduced him to a new generation of fans, he once acknowledged not having read any of J.K. Rowling\u2019s bestselling books. Among those to pay tribute was Richard Harris\u2019 son, Jared Harris, who wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Gambon was a \u201cbrilliant actor\u201d who lived \u201cunforgettably in my memory.\u201d Actor James Phelps, who played Fred Weasley in the Harry Potter film series, also paid tribute on X, where he called Gambon \u201ca legend.\u201d He would retire from the stage in 2015 after he struggled to remember his lines in front of an audience because of his advancing age. Fiercely protective of his private life, Gambon married Anne Miller, and they had one son, Fergus. He is also survived by two sons he had with set designer Philippa Hart.

        "title": "She was offered five figures to promote an AI clone service on TikTok \u2014 then the company went dark",
        "content": "When career advice guru Eve Pe\u00f1a was offered a five-figure brand deal to promote a company she had never heard of to her TikTok following, she was intrigued. Then she learned what it claimed to be offering: a service that would create AI clones of people, taking on their full human likenesses, to attend virtual job interviews and generate answers based on the clients\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. \u201cThe first thing I said to that was: \u2018This is really unethical. People are going to tell me, too,\u2019\u201d Pe\u00f1a said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd [the representative] said: \u2018Well, I do think it\u2019s unethical, as well \u2026 but we\u2019re going to create some talking points that you can deflect hate comments with.\u2019\u201d Pe\u00f1a is one of three creators who told NBC News that they were approached with the offer \u2014 and that they quickly grew wary that it was a scam. Less than two weeks later, the company, StartupHelper, went dark online, with its website\u2019s contents taken down entirely and its TikTok page set to private. It was a bizarre episode featuring the collision of two distinct dynamics: the murky world of partnerships, in which creators are approached to sponsor relatively unknown companies, and the rise of generative AI technology, which has tremendous potential but little oversight. The first thing I said to that was: \u2018This is really unethical.\u2019 -TIKTOK CREATOR EVE PE\u00d1A \u201cIt was such a crazy amount that they were offering that I was like, \u2018This has to be some kind of scam or some kind of fraud,\u2019\u201d Pe\u00f1a said of the brand deal, which promised $48,000 over six months, as well as a 10% commission per client recruited to the platform. The company would charge clients $500 down payments along with 10% of their first year\u2019s salaries if they got jobs using the service. Most brands don\u2019t pitch numbers in emails without wanting to discuss creators\u2019 rates first, Pe\u00f1a said, especially not in such an aggressive manner. So she asked for more clarity in her Zoom call with the representative. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a net 30 payment,\u2019 so I would have had to create videos for them for 30 days before I saw any payment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, this seems like you guys are looking for free marketing and then you\u2019re just not going to pay anybody.\u201d The explosion of generative AI capabilities has opened the door to a variety of uses, from drafting emails to producing whole deepfakes, sparking a rush to figure out ways to capitalize on the technologies. In the world of human resources, that has meant questions about just how much employers should use AI to comb through applications and whether applicants risk crossing ethical lines with AI-generated r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. But an AI-generated clone \u2014 what StartupHelper describes as \u201ca digital body double that attends job interviews on your behalf\u201d \u2014 was over the line to some creators who specialize in career content. Career content has become its own popular niche on TikTok and other tech platforms, where influencers regularly amass hundreds of thousands of followers. And it\u2019s common for popular TikTok creators to be approached by brands looking to promote their services through sponsored deals. But it\u2019s a largely opaque \u2014 and sometimes fraught \u2014 market, meaning such deals can fall apart if negotiations reach dead ends or products don\u2019t align with the creators\u2019 values.  The creators who spoke with NBC News said that after StartupHelper approached them, they were concerned by the services it was offering, as well as the terms of the suggested brand deal. Before the content on the StartupHelper website was removed, it advertised the digital clone and other services, such as auto-applying for jobs and optimizing LinkedIn profiles.  Pe\u00f1a, whose videos focus on teaching people how to join the corporate world, quickly called out the company on TikTok for being unethical. In her video, she issued a \u201cwarning to career tik tok,\u201d sharing details of what she learned about the service after she held a Zoom call with a representative. StartupHelper\u2019s clients, Pe\u00f1a said, are asked to send the company a few videos of themselves speaking so its AI developers and engineers could study their mannerisms and program clones to attend virtual interviews on their behalf.   \u201cIf you see any influencers peddling the \u2018What if you never had to be in a job interview again? What if you had a clone?\u2019 just judge them,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cKnow that they sold their soul for that one. And please, don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d After Pe\u00f1a\u2019s video started gaining traction, StartupHelper\u2019s TikTok profile left comments claiming to be the company in question. She said she blocked the account to avoid giving it free promotion. Then, bot accounts began swarming her comments claiming StartupHelper helped them secure jobs. After she used a filter to block out any mention of the company name, its own TikTok page began posting now-deleted videos disparaging her. StartupHelper didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Its startuphelper.com email addresses were no longer active Tuesday. Its website is now just a landing page with a message that states: \u201cWe would be back with a better and ethical product that champions the rights of the working class in a fast changing AI driven world. Thanks for all your feedback.\u201d  The saga is the latest manifestation of ethical and security concerns surrounding the unregulated use of AI technology, demonstrating how creators often struggle to navigate balancing personal morals with the need to make money off content creation. Ever since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT late last year, technologists have anticipated an explosion in the number of startups looking to use generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence systems capable of creating humanlike content, including print, photos and video \u2014 for all manner of business and consumer services. Some companies have already pushed ahead with technologies that offer ways for people to make AI versions of themselves. Aphid, a fintech company that creates AI workers to handle multiple online tasks at once, envisions a future in which people make digital clones that can work in their place. Such companies remain largely unregulated, though there has been plenty of discussion about how to write rules concerning the development of AI. Pe\u00f1a and the two other creators who spoke with NBC News said that when they first got StartupHelper\u2019s pitch, they were eager to learn more. But the initial email sent to them, a copy of which NBC News reviewed, was vague, and it made no mention of an AI-driven cloning service, describing itself only as \u201ca job placement company looking to change how people get jobs and earn more in the corporate space.\u201d \u201cWe envision a collaborative partnership where you can be our brand mascot and bring to life our company by association,\u201d a representative had written in the outreach emails. Farah Sharghi, a creator who gives career advice on TikTok, said the terms of the deal caused her to ghost the company after she initially asked for more information. After she read through its content plan later on, she said, she discovered what she said were a host of ethical concerns that reaffirmed her decision not to accept. The 10-page content plan the company sent provides scripts for creators to use, including specific responses to critical comments, such as: \u201cIsn\u2019t this illegal? Like what if they find out that you did this to get the job?\u201d It\u2019s a concern that highlights the lack of federal regulation around the use of AI technologies. To that, the document urges creators to say: \u201cI think it is funny how it is always deemed illegal when it is an individual not a company that uses a shortcut to bypass traditional systems and not the other way round. \u2026 We are about to step into a post labor economics, your only priority should be getting the job that pays the most without any of the hassle.\u201d The document also encourages creators to follow scripts that openly tout \u201ccheat[ing] your way to getting that job\u201d and urges followers \u201cto block all the career advice people,\u201d reasoning that \u201cthey don\u2019t care about you, they simply care about turning you to sheep people who would bend over backwards for companies that don\u2019t care about you.\u201d It doesn\u2019t address questions about data privacy and whether the company plans to use clients\u2019 likenesses for other purposes. Sharghi said that she believes AI tools can help job seekers in more ethical ways but that such a cloning service immediately set off alarm bells. \u201cI\u2019ve spent three years on my social platform, and I would never want to risk my own reputation or my brand reputation just for some money. Like, it doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they look to be doing is just blatant fraud, and it does not pass the smell test for me at all.\u201d The creators also said the money StartupHelper offered seemed too good to be true. But Gabrielle Judge, the TikTok creator credited with coining the term \u201clazy girl job,\u201d said the payment actually amounted to very little once you looked more closely at the request. It asked for one post a day over six months, on top of putting StartupHelper\u2019s link in creators\u2019 bios, along with a short sentence. \u201cAt first you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s excellent money,\u2019 but then when you look at the actual work that you had to do, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d she said.  In addition, Pe\u00f1a said she was told the company\u2019s CEO is based in Dubai. But no business license is registered under the company\u2019s name in the United Arab Emirates.

        "title": "A timeline of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's budding romance",
        "content": "Taylor Swift showing up for Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs game Sunday shocked and thrilled the world, but some people may also be confused how this budding romance began. Rumors about the two potentially dating have been circling the internet since the summer, and many of Swift's fans were rooting for the relationship. News broke in April that Swift, 33, ended her six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn just as her world tour was picking up steam in the United States. Kelce, 33, appears to have remained single after breaking up with his longtime girlfriend and sports journalist Kayla Nicole in 2022. A source close to the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer confirmed to NBC News that Swift and Kelce were \u201changing out\u201d but things between them were in early stages. While Swift has already done a lot in life greater than just dating the boy on the football team, there might still be room for Kelce in the pop superstar's world. Kelce, 33, did more than just drop a hint that he was interested in Swift \u2014 he publicly declared his interest in her to the world. The Chief's tight end attended the Eras Tour in July when Swift was performing at Arrowhead Stadium, his team's home turf. Her fans, who call themselves \"Swifties,\" posted about his appearance on social media. Kelce and his brother, Jason Kelce, later discussed his appearance at the concert on their podcast \"New Heights\" and a clip of it was posted to their TikTok account July 26. He said he attended the show and was \"butt hurt\" that Swift wasn't able to speak to him prior to her performance. \u201cIf you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets,\" Kelce said. \"And I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\u201d \u201cYour number as in 87, or your phone number?\u201d his brother asked. \u201cYou know which one,\" Kelce joked back. As one Taylor Swift fan account noted Sunday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, \u201che had a friendship bracelet and a dream.\u201d Kelce explained that Swift probably didn't see anyone in an effort to save her voice, or maybe she just didn't want to see him. But that was enough to get headlines written and the seed planted in the minds of fans all over the world. All was quiet on the Kelce and Swift front for the next few weeks, as she was still completing the first U.S. leg of her tour and released her \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" re-recording. In that time she also announced the upcoming release of \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" during a concert in Los Angeles. A playful moment dropped Aug. 5, when Chiefs social media did a TikTok video questioning players about their celebrity crushes.  \u201cMine was...\u201d Kelce pondered.  \u201cTaylor Swift?\u201d his teammate interrupted, causing Kelce to chuckle before moving on.  The cheeky clip was brushed aside by many as mischievous teasing between teammates at the time. But hints started to drop again at the end of August, through the Kelce brothers' podcast. The NFL's preseason had begun and the brothers were discussing Kelce's annual training camp mustache in their Aug. 31 podcast episode. \"Have you found out what Taylor Swift thinks of your mustache?\" his brother asked. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode,\" Kelce deflected with a chuckle. \"But something tells me she\u2019s gonna like it.\u201d  That one-liner was enough to resurface the speculation that maybe Swift and Kelce were seeing each other after her tour schedule slowed down in early August. As the NFL season kicked off Sept. 7, both Kelce and his brother, who plays center for the Philadelphia Eagles, were doing press interviews. Interviewers did not hold back in using Swift-related puns or asking the brothers directly about the rumors. On Sept. 15, Jason Kelce appeared for an interview on the Amazon Prime postgame show after his team beat the Minnesota Vikings. NFL Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez asked whether he could comment on whether his brother was dating Swift. \u201cI\u2019ve seen these rumors; I cannot comment,\u201d the Eagles' player said. He then confessed that he \"didn't really know\" what was going on but that his brother \"is having fun. We\u2019ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.\u201d Two days later, Kelce returned to the field for his first game of the season after sitting out for a knee injury. Commentators decided to have some fun when he scored a touchdown, saying he managed to find a \"blank space\" in the end zone, a reference to the title of one of Swift's top hits. Finally, Kelce was asked in an interview on \"The Pat McAfee Show\u201d whether the headlines about his personal life bothered him. The Chiefs tight end said he found all the speculation \"hilarious,\" likening the the entire situation to a childhood game of \"telephone.\" \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\" Kelce said, setting the record straight. \"I told her, I\u2019ve seen you rock a stage in Arrowhead and you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead. We\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d Swift obviously took him up on the offer and showed up to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday to watch Kelce play against the Chicago Bears. She was seen in a private suite with Kelce's mother, Donna, cheering him on while decked out in Chiefs colors. The pop superstar was later seen leaving the stadium with Kelce, telling him in a video clip posted to the X that \"it was the best.\" Many of Swifts' fans were simply delighted to see her having a good time at the game, posting jokes all across social media about her enthusiasm, her potential romance and her turning her back on her hometown team, the Eagles. Kelce discussed her appearance on the Wednesday episode of his podcast, calling it \"a game to remember.\" \u201cShoutout to Taylor for pulling up, that was pretty ballsy!\u201d he said on the episode of \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which he co-hosts with his brother, Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce. \u201cI just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her, the friends and family,\" he added. \"She looked amazing. Everyone was talking about her in great light.\" He joked that Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid played matchmaker: \u201cI know that he had met the Swift family before, so I don\u2019t know, he could have been in the background the whole time.\u201d Swift's time at the game was given the meme treatment while people also celebrated Kelce as a deviation from previous men in Swift's life, including former boyfriend Alwyn and her recent interlude with Matt Healy, The 1975's frontman. Unlike those men, Kelce is American, and his career is based in athletics, not the arts. Swift is a record-breaking musician at the height of her fame this year, and Kelce is a two-time Super Bowl champion, so it\u2019s unsurprising that it would be difficult for them to get to know each other privately. \"Also reminder that casual dating is a thing even for celebrities \u2014 going on a date or two does not make anyone official,\" one fan wrote on X. Others also chimed in, saying they didn't care whether the relationship was serious but that it was nice to see Swift \"having fun.\" It\u2019s unclear exactly how far their relationship has progressed by the time Swift showed up at the game Sunday.

        "title": "Steroid TikTok videos aimed at teens get millions of views, according to report",
        "content": "People promoting steroids and similar products used for off-label performance enhancement are bringing in millions of views on TikTok and sometimes even targeting teenagers, according to a report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a tech watchdog group. According to the report released Thursday, U.S. users ages 18-24 viewed videos using hashtags associated with steroids and related substances up to 420 million times in the last three years.  The group monitored hashtags associated with a variety of drugs popular in some fitness circles, including steroids and other illegal or highly regulated drugs and supplements that are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human consumption \u2014 what the report called \u201csteroid-like drugs.\u201d Many of the videos promoting the drugs and supplements could be found with hashtags such as #teenfitness and #teenbodybuilding. The videos cited in the report often featured people with extremely large muscles and unrealistic body shapes promoting use of the substances while downplaying potential health risks and side effects. Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said that \u201cboys are being taught that they need to have really big muscles like Avengers to be a real man.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile, they are seeing this \u2018super serum\u2019 on TikTok that is touted to help them to achieve that without making them aware how incredibly harmful these drugs are,\u201d he said.  A TikTok spokesperson criticized the report\u2019s methodology, saying the numbers in it also include \u201cpositive content\u201d related to recovery from drugs. A spokesperson for the Center for Countering Digital Hate responded by saying \"our analysis only examined hashtags where a majority of content posted with those hashtags promotes, sells or otherwise normalizes use of steroids or steroid-like drugs.\" TikTok is home to a large and active fitness community that often openly discusses steroids and the unrealistic expectations that can come from their use. \u201cNatty or not\u201d videos have become their own subgenre on the app, in which people speculate on who is \u201cnatural\u201d or who is not using steroids. One such account still active on TikTok, referred to in the report and reviewed by NBC News, promoted the use of an estrogen-blocking hormone by teenagers to increase their penis size. The account, which has nearly over 40,000 TikTok followers, provided a discount code to a popular website that sells steroid-like drugs. Anabolic-androgenic steroids, drugs that are subject to strict regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, have still been promoted on TikTok, according to the report. The sale and possession of them without valid prescriptions are considered felonies and could be punished by up to 10 years in jail. The report also pointed to drugs promoted on TikTok that are popular in fitness communities and considered similar to steroids \u2014 peptides and selective androgen receptor modulators, or SARMs. A TikTok representative said content related to SARMs will be removed when it is found. The FDA has not approved either for over-the-counter sale as drugs. Many steroids and steroid-like drugs lack adequate research in humans to be properly prescribed or have been shown to have adverse effects in initial studies.  Often, such substances are sold as \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d to skirt such rules, according to the report. The report also detailed videos that encourage teenagers to hide what it calls \"steroid-like drugs\" by telling their parents things like \u201cThey\u2019re vitamins.\u201d The report said the research group found 35 influencers who are all involved in schemes that sell illegal or highly regulated steroid-like drugs, potentially allowing them to benefit financially from the sales of drugs. The center said it found one TikTok bodybuilder account that inaccurately identified the personality involved as a doctor.   Ahmed said he believes TikTok has been slow to act because incentives aside from teen health are at play. By allowing the broadest range of content possible, TikTok can attract more users to stay on the app.  TikTok\u2019s community guidelines say TikTok prohibits content that promotes recreational drug use or the sale of drugs. Aside from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, the FDA has also issued warnings about social media\u2019s role in the popularity and sale of steroid-like drugs, saying \u201csocial media posts by influencers and sellers of SARMs contribute to the availability and promotion of these dangerous products.\u201d It is not the first time that TikTok has appeared to struggle with drug-related content. Late last year, it removed some posts promoting migraine and epilepsy drugs to underage viewers as weight loss aids. In July, it launched another crackdown that temporarily banned some accounts that link to the use of the weight-loss drug Ozempic. Huiling Zhou is an intern on NBC News Digital's tech desk. ",

        "title": "'Rick and Morty' co-creator says he's 'ashamed and heartbroken' after Justin Roiland allegations",
        "content": "\u201cRick and Morty\u201d co-creator Dan Harmon broke his silence on accusations made against show co-creator Justin Roiland, saying in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he felt \u201cfrustrated, ashamed and heartbroken\u201d by the news. Harmon\u2019s comments come in response to NBC News\u2019 reporting. Eleven women and nonbinary people shared thousands of messages with Roiland sent between 2013 and 2022 with NBC News. Nine of the people who spoke with NBC News said Roiland allegedly turned the exchanges sexual and of those nine people, three said they were 16 when they began talking to Roiland. One woman told NBC News that she was forced by Roiland to perform oral sex. Harmon did not address specific allegations while speaking with The Hollywood Reporter. Andrew Brettler, a lawyer representing Roiland, previously said the allegations are \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday regarding Harmon\u2019s recent comments. \u201cTrust has now been violated between countless people and a show designed to please them,\u201d Harmon, 50, told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated, ashamed and heartbroken that a lot of hard work, joy and passion can be leveraged to exploit and harm strangers.\u201d  Roiland, 42, had been charged with felony domestic battery and false imprisonment in Orange County, California, over an alleged incident in 2020. The charges were dismissed in March, with the district attorney\u2019s office citing insufficient evidence. At that time, Roiland released a statement titled \u201cjustice,\u201d saying the claims were false.  Following news of Roiland\u2019s alleged misconduct, Harmon said the \u201ceasiest thing\u201d for him to say about Roiland was \u201cnothing.\u201d \u201cEasy because he isolated so well and easy because I\u2019m nobody\u2019s first choice as a judge of anything or anyone,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cThis is where I\u2019d love to change the subject to myself, to what a piece of crap I\u2019ve been my whole public life. I would feel so safe and comfortable making this about me, but that trick is worthless here and dangerous to others. It\u2019s other people\u2019s safety and comfort that got damaged while I obsessed over a cartoon\u2019s quality.\u201d Harmon\u2019s statements to The Hollywood Reporter come two weeks after NBC News published its most recent investigation in Roiland, which documented separate allegations against him. Representatives for Harmon did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.  Harmon, who also created the show \u201cCommunity,\u201d said his final conversation with Roiland, which occurred in 2019 over text, brought him to tears. He said Roiland \u201csaid things that he\u2019d never said before about being unhappy \u2026 but then this conversation became unprecedentedly confrontational.\u201d In March, Adult Swim and Disney\u2019s 20th Television Animation cut ties with Roiland. A spokesperson for Adult Swim declined to comment regarding comments Harmon made during the interview. Disney\u2019s 20th Television Animation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  New voice actors were hired to replace Roiland, who also provided voices for the show\u2019s titular characters. Harmon said he chose to be largely uninvolved in selecting the replacement voice actors.  \u201cIt\u2019s all just sad because the goal is for it to be indistinguishable,\u201d he told THR. \u201cAt the same time, it would be absurd to suddenly decide that the entire foundation of your creative project was, oh, coincidentally, unimportant.\u201d Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "title": "Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel announce late-night returns after strike ends",
        "content": "Some of your favorite late-night television talk show hosts are returning to the air now that the Hollywood writers strike has come to an end. NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" will return Monday. Also back on the same night will be CBS\u2019 \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"  The announcements came on the shows' respective social media accounts Wednesday morning. Several of the late-night hosts teamed up for a podcast called \u201cStrike Force Five\u201d while their shows were off the air. It was a limited series featuring Fallon, Meyers, Colbert, Kimmel and John Oliver, and profits from the podcast went to their out-of-work show teams. In a joint statement from \"Strike Force Five\" announcing the return to television, they said that \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" will return to HBO on Sunday. HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d also took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to tell viewers that the show will be back with new episodes Friday. The restriction for writers to work ended during the early hours of Wednesday, after it was announced that the Writers Guild of America had agreed to a three-year agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers  Among the issues hammered out in the deal were higher wages, a raise in the rates of health care and pension contributions, bonuses to residuals based on viewership for streaming, and other details and rules about artificial intelligence.

        "title": "Different generations are sharing what they did before they could look stuff up on the internet",
        "content": "What did people do before they could look something up on the internet? That\u2019s what comedian Sarah Adelman, 26, wanted to know after she found herself with a dead cellphone trying to navigate her way home from Brooklyn, New York. So she turned to TikTok and decided to ask her elders. \u201cIf you saw someone and you were like, \u2018Oh, they remind me of that actor. What\u2019s his name?\u2019 and none of your friends knew, would you go to a library?\u201d Adelman asked in her video, which has been viewed over 300,000 times. \u201cAnd before Google Maps \u2014 I know that there was MapQuest, but before that, genuinely, what would you do? Would you just accept not knowing?\u201d The reaction was both funny and wholesome \u2014 with over thousands of people weighing in in the comments and sharing their reactions in stitched videos. The video and its response also demonstrated a rarity on the internet: Generations came together, rather than mock one another. Many who replied appeared to identify as millennials, who are typically defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about this video is that it asks older generations to see themselves in a historical way by highlighting how all of our lives are different today than in the past,\u201d Pamela Aronson, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, said in an email. \u201cThe post is thus not creating conflict between generations with dismissive comments like \u2018OK, boomer.\u2019\u201d  The idea for the video stemmed from Adelman\u2019s genuine interest in learning how people \u201clived in uncertainty before the internet.\u201d   \u201cEven before handheld devices,\u201d Adelman said in a phone interview. \u201cEven having to go home to Google something, I cannot comprehend that.\u201d The responses enlightened her.  \u201cFor maps \u2026 you had to use an actual folded map and stop and ask for directions at gas stations,\u201d a person commented. \u201cYour aunt said something was fact, and you believed that until you found out otherwise,\u201d another user said. \u201cNot all questions were answered,\u201d a commenter added. What\u2019s striking about this video is that it asks older generations to see themselves in a historical way by highlighting how all of our lives are different today than in the past. -PAMELA ARONSON, A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN-DEARBORN \u201cThere was no way of going and looking it up,\u201d TikToker Tom Powell Jr. said in a video response, referring specifically to finding a celebrity\u2019s name. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go to the library to look it up like you might have suggested in the video.\u201d Powell also showed off a photo of a wire-bound book that included maps of the Chicago area, which he said he kept in his car at all times when he needed maps. The book had reference points on the pages and an index with cities in the area. Dawn Marie, a travel TikToker, said in a video that because the information wasn\u2019t at your fingertips, you had \u201cto get crafty.\u201d For celebrities, she said, you would either accept not knowing or go to the local Blockbuster to find the movie cover. \u201cOr you\u2019d ask the kid who worked there,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople at Blockbuster seemed to know every movie, who starred in them and all the things about movies.\u201d Adelman\u2019s TikTok video, Aronson said, brought Gen Z and members of other generations together to reflect on how technology has shaped the nature of everyday life. \u201cGen Z would identify with this post, because they can\u2019t even imagine life without these things,\u201d Aronson said \u201cBut I think that older generations have also become technology-dependent, so when they see this post, they likely think about how things have changed historically in their own lifetimes.\u201d Adelman, who was born in 1997, said she expected her video to do well because, she said, most generations lean into nostalgia. But in addition to attracting views, she also wanted to ensure her video came across as genuine. \u201cI knew that I would get hate if I didn\u2019t ask it in a nice way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I was like, \u2018I\u2019m genuinely asking,\u2019 because I was genuinely curious what people had to say.\u201d ",

        "title": "Why this Vermont town is banning influencers and tourists from visiting its fall foliage",
        "content": "A Vermont town known for its autumn foliage has closed its roads to the public for the season, citing an overwhelming amount of influencer tourists. The select board of Pomfret voted to close Cloudland Road and Barber Hill Road to non-residents from Sept. 23 to Oct. 15. That also blocks access to the popular Sleepy Hollow Farm, a private residence that many tourists try to visit. \"Foliage season traffic in this area has steadily increased during the last several years, causing significant safety, environmental, aesthetic, and quality of life issues,\" the select board wrote in a memo. Sleepy Hollow Farm has been a hot destination for influencers looking to get the perfect shot of fall foliage. Videos using the hashtag #sleepyhollowfarm have been viewed over 800,000 times on TikTok. Meanwhile, thousands of photos of the farm have been posted to Instagram. Some TikTok videos from recent years showed crowds around the entrance to Sleepy Hollow Farm, which had a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. Despite the sign, one video shows tourists entering the property to take pictures. The pursuit of idyllic fall photos has caused headaches for Pomfret residents. Some people in the community created a GoFundMe campaign, titled \"Save Cloudland Road,\" to raise money for road closures and traffic enforcement during the fall season. \"Over the past several years, Cloudland Road (and the small roads leading to Cloudland Road) have experienced an unprecedented surge in Instagram and TikTok-fueled tourist 'influencers,' who earn money from sponsors and have monetized and turned a private home on Cloudland Road into a social media photo destination,\" the GoFundMe description reads. The campaign, which has raised almost $15,000, also claimed that influencers visiting the town \"damaged roads, had accidents, required towing out of ditches, trampled gardens, defecated on private property, parked in fields and driveways, and verbally assaulted residents.\" A person who donated wrote in the comments, \"I hope you home returns to being one and not an instagram destination.\" A Pomfret resident suggested that tourists looking for picturesque foliage travel elsewhere. \u201cYou can just drive up [Interstate] 89, which is our north-south throughway, and have a beautiful drive,\u201d Beth Finlayson told TODAY.com.

        "title": "Ruby Franke's business partner gave life coaching that ruined lives, some former clients say",
        "content": "The business partner of family YouTube vlogger Ruby Franke is facing scrutiny over her life coaching service, ConneXions, which former patients described as a program that isolated them from loved ones and destroyed marriages. Before she was arrested alongside Franke on child abuse charges, Jodi Hildebrandt was counseling Mormon couples and families in Utah. Seven former patients, who used her services between 2008 and 2019, told NBC News that Hildebrandt methodically separated spouses, pathologized patients\u2019 behaviors as evidence of various addictions and encouraged people to cut off others who weren\u2019t living in accordance with her teachings. \u201cThe theory was that if you\u2019re meeting with Jodi, then you are all living in truth,\u201d said Stephanie Jones, 29, who was counseled by Hildebrandt with her ex-husband for nine months in 2019. \u201cAnd so she didn\u2019t want you talking to anyone else about your problem. She wanted you talking to people that were also living in truth. So this is where I started to feel like it kind of got cult-like. She wanted everything to stay in the group. You\u2019re not allowed to have a different opinion than her.\u201d Hildebrandt, a therapist, was arrested in August. She and Franke were each charged with six counts of felony child abuse \u2014 unrelated to her work with ConneXions \u2014 after Franke\u2019s injured 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s home. Franke\u2019s malnourished 10-year-old daughter was also found in Hildebrandt\u2019s home. Hildebrandt established ConneXions in 2007, according to her LinkedIn page, although Utah Department of Commerce records show that it was registered as an LLC in April 2018. The service is known for its courses on relationships and parenting, which some former clients say are rooted in the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 also known as LDS or the Mormon church. The lessons revolve around concepts of \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cdeception,\u201d according to ConneXions slideshow presentations reviewed by NBC News. The slides describe how people live in \u201cdistortion\u201d when they allow their wants, needs and experiences to impact their commitments to the \u201ctruth.\u201d Franke, who is listed as a \u201ccertified mental fitness trainer\u201d on the ConneXions website, was prominently featured in the service\u2019s videos alongside Hildebrandt. In now-deleted YouTube videos viewed by NBC News, the two preached that those who are not living in \u201ctruth,\u201d including children, should be cut off from the rest of their families. None of the clients who spoke to NBC News said Franke counseled them. Former clients of Hildebrandt's who spoke with NBC News, all of whom were active members of the church at the time of their treatment, said that Hildebrandt took an extreme approach to LDS teachings in her lessons.  An attorney for Hildebrandt did not respond to repeated requests for comment made via email, by phone and an in-person office visit last week. A representative for LaMar Winward, Franke\u2019s attorney, declined to comment.  A spokesperson for the LDS church also did not respond to a request for comment. The church has also not publicly issued comments on allegations made about Hildebrandt or her recent arrest.  A primary focus in Hildebrandt\u2019s programs, specifically for the men in her treatment, concerned porn and sex addiction, those who spoke to NBC News said.  Hildebrandt previously worked as a therapist specializing in \u201cporn addiction.\u201d Porn addiction is not recognized as a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the standard classification manual used by mental health counselors in the United States, although the LDS church encourages people to seek help from LDS-sponsored addiction recovery programs if they struggle with pornography consumption. Pornography is considered a huge sin by the church, even perceived by some as a gateway to serious crimes like murder, according to John Dehlin, a former therapist and host of the podcast \u201cMormon Stories,\u201d which seeks to bring awareness to issues within LDS culture. He said LDS members are taught that men are \u201csexual animals\u201d and women are \u201cthe gatekeepers.\u201d Dehlin interviewed several former patients of Hildebrandt\u2019s and reviewed ConneXions material for his podcast.  Five men told NBC News that they were diagnosed with porn or sex addictions by Hildebrandt, although all of them said that they didn\u2019t exhibit any abnormal issues with either.  They said they were put into men\u2019s counseling groups that focused on porn, sex and lust. Group counseling involved weekly hourlong meetings and daily \u201csupport calls\u201d in which participants called each other to discuss their therapy goals. They said that in these meetings their peers described getting kicked out of the house or abstaining from sex with their spouses for months at a time as punishment for watching pornography.  Spencer Tibbets, who described his childhood as \u201cextremely sheltered\u201d with little access to technology, said he was sent to Hildebrandt for two months when he was 16 after getting in trouble for obtaining a secret phone to play video games. Hildebrandt moved him from her children\u2019s group to her men\u2019s group so that he could have more in-depth conversations about his treatment goals. The men\u2019s group participants were being treated for porn addiction.  \u201cI had a secret phone, but I didn\u2019t even know what porn was,\u201d Tibbets, now 21, said. Tibbets said that during support calls, men in the group would describe how they had been separated from their wives because they struggled with porn consumption. Tibbets said that in one call, a group member described incest fantasies to him.  Tibbets said Hildebrandt told him that if he \u201cdidn\u2019t accept the Mormon God, [he] would never be able to get help from therapy.\u201d At the time, he was questioning his faith after his father had given him the choice to attend church or not. Brian Tibbets, 47, father of Spencer Tibbets, said he also saw Hildebrandt with his ex-wife for about four months in early 2018. He said his choice to leave the LDS church caused a strain in their relationship. They placed their three eldest children in Hildebrandt\u2019s courses. Tibbets\u2019 ex-wife did not respond to a request for comment.  In 2012, Hildebrandt was disciplined by Utah\u2019s Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing, according to documents obtained by NBC News. She was put on probation for 18 months by the state after she engaged in \u201cunprofessional conduct.\u201d  Hildebrandt disclosed information about a patient, identified as \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d with LDS church leaders and Brigham Young University officials, according to a 2012 stipulation and order report from DOPL obtained by NBC News. Doe was a student at BYU at the time. She also had a dual relationship with the patient\u2019s wife, \u201cJane Doe,\u201d whom she was counseling and managing as an intern, which is considered unprofessional. Her license was later reinstated with full privileges on Aug. 6, 2013.  Hildebrandt was taken off of the LDS family services roster after her license was put on probation, according to a 2012 report from The Salt Lake Tribune. But some patients told NBC News she was still informally recommended to them either by their bishops or by loved ones in the church after being removed from the roster. My family got destroyed. My life got destroyed. ADAM PAUL STEED, 40, WHO SAW JODI HILDEBRANDT WITH HIS THEN-WIFE FOR NINE MONTHS IN 2008 Adam Paul Steed, 40, who saw Hildebrandt with his then-wife for nine months in 2008, said he is the unnamed patient in the report that led Hildebrandt to be put on probation. He said Hildebrandt tried to treat him for a sex and porn addiction after he started marriage counseling, but he refused. NBC News reviewed a DOPL complaint naming Steed, therapy notes from Steed\u2019s sessions with Hildebrandt and an honor code report from BYU.  Steed said Hildebrandt had made false claims about him to the church, BYU and his ex-wife. He said he lost church privileges, was temporarily suspended from BYU and got divorced due to Hildebrandt\u2019s actions.  \u201cMy family got destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life got destroyed.\u201d Steed, who experienced childhood sexual abuse as a teen, said that Hildebrandt weaponized his experience with abuse against him. His marriage began to deteriorate around nine months into seeing Hildebrandt, who he said had insisted the couple needed to \u201ctriple down\u201d on the amount of therapy sessions they were taking. \u201c[Hildebrandt] was blaming everything on me being a sexual addict at that point,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was saying that that every time I said I was a victim of sexual abuse, that that was my addiction speaking. So if I had PTSD and trauma, and I mentioned it, they would confront me that that was my addiction of sexual abuse.\u201d When they began seeing Hildebrandt, he believed his ex-wife began feeling like she had to \u201cprotect\u201d herself and their children from him. Steed\u2019s ex-wife declined to comment through her attorney Chris Wharton, who said, \u201cOut of respect for the judicial process and the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor children, my client is not providing any further comments at this time.\u201d Stephanie Jones, 29, said a bishop in her church referred her and her then-husband to Hildebrandt in 2019 after she alleged that he had been physically and emotionally abusive toward her. At first, Jones said she loved Hildebrandt\u2019s program because it was the first time she learned about boundaries and codependency. She later felt that the group counseling sessions were not helpful in addressing the abuse in her relationship. Her ex-husband, like other men in Hildebrandt\u2019s program, was treated for a \u201clust\u201d addiction. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like she helped with what we were actually there to get help with,\u201d Jones said. Jones said Hildebrandt helped keep her ex-husband \u201cin line.\u201d But when she told Hildebrandt she wanted to leave him, the therapist encouraged her to stay. \u201cI do feel like she prolonged me staying with him because his behavior genuinely did improve when we were seeing her, but I think it was just because he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble,\u201d Jones said.  Jones\u2019 ex-husband, who is currently incarcerated for an unrelated aggravated assault, confirmed through his attorney Joseph Rupp that he was put in a group for sex, lust and porn addiction. The lawyer said his client \u201cbelieves that Stephanie might characterize their relationship as physically or emotionally abusive\u201d but that the client \u201cdid not specify.\u201d The ex-husband confirmed via Rupp that Hildebrandt encouraged them to stay together. Jones said that in the women's group, women without any other formal mental health diagnosis were treated for \u201ccontrol addiction.\u201d Control addiction is not recognized as a disorder in the DSM-5. Jones said that an example of her addiction was if she tried to appease her husband when she was scared of him. She was told that she was trying to \u201ccontrol his emotions so that [she didn\u2019t] get hurt.\u201d \u201cIs it fair to call everyone that comes through your program an addict just because you want to be their savior?\u201d Jones said. \u201cShe labeled me an addict as well. And she had me through a 12-step program for control.\u201d Jones was told to write down every way she used her addiction, which she was unable to do. She felt like the diagnosis was too abstract. Still, she had to call people in the women\u2019s group about her supposed problem.  Eliza Tibbets, 19, said she was treated by Hildebrandt at the same time as her brother Spencer in 2018. She said Hildebrandt diagnosed her with a \u201ccontrol addiction\u201d when she was 13 and in the children\u2019s group at the time. She was eventually put into a 12-step program for a \u201clying addiction\u201d because she wrote secret notes to her neighbors and acquired a secret phone to watch Netflix. Tibbets didn\u2019t feel like she had a lying problem. When she tried explaining herself, she said Hildebrandt would accuse her of living in \u201cdistortion.\u201d When she was in the 12-step program, she was told to write down the ways she used her addiction. She also had to call adult women in Hildebrandt\u2019s program to keep herself accountable.  \u201cI\u2019d never ever felt like any of them, especially Jodi, was like a safe place to go to for therapy,\u201d Tibbets said. \u201cI never felt safe. I always felt like I was getting attacked.\u201d She said Hildebrandt would often shame her and accuse her of being distorted if she said \u201csomething that she perceived as a lie\u201d or was \u201cnot being completely compliant with her.\u201d  Tibbets made it through four steps before she moved in with her father. They both stopped seeing Hildebrandt by the end of 2018. The Utah Division of Professional Licensing, as the agency is now known, said last week that Hildebrandt voluntarily surrendered her mental health counseling license on Sept. 19. Her license is still active, but limited. She is not being formally disciplined by DOPL, but she will be unable to practice if she is released from jail, according to a stipulation and order report from the agency obtained by NBC News. \u201cGiven the heinous abuse allegations, the agency felt that the surrender of the license was the best course of action to protect the safety of Hildebrandt\u2019s patients and clients,\u201d Margaret Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.  Hildebrandt and Franke are both being held without bail until their next court hearing, which a judge has not yet scheduled.  CORRECTION (Sept. 25, 2023, 9 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the nature of Adam Steed\u2019s sessions with Jodi Hildebrandt. He was not treated for sex and porn addiction, which he says he refused. Daysia Tolentino is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

        "content": "British police confirmed Monday they are looking into \"a number of allegations of sexual offenses\" against controversial comedian Russell Brand both in London and in the rest of the country. In an announcement, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it began the probe after a joint investigation from The Times of London, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches, in which four women accused Brand of sexual assault or rape. A fifth woman also accused him of flashing his genitals at her. \"Following an investigation by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches and The Sunday Times, the Met has received a number of allegations of sexual offenses in London,\" the Metropolitan Police said. \"We have also received a number of allegations of sexual offenses committed elsewhere in the country and will investigate these.\" The allegations \"are all non-recent,\" the statement said. The Metropolitan Police did not divulge any new details about the allegations. Before the announcement, the Metropolitan Police said it had received a report from one woman \"of a sexual assault which was alleged to have taken place in Soho in central London in 2003.\" Brand, 48, has rejected all the claims, saying in a video statement that his relationships were \u201calways consensual.\u201d The investigation is being led by detectives from the Met's Central Specialist Crime Command, which is led by Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy.  \u201cWe continue to encourage anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a sexual offence, no matter how long ago it was, to contact us,\" Furphy said in the Met statement. \u201cWe understand it can feel like a difficult step to take and I want to reassure that we have a team of specialist officers available to advise and support.\u201d Senior British politicians have been urging police to investigate the allegations, while the U.K. entertainment industry has faced questions about whether Brand\u2019s bad behavior went unchallenged because of his fame. The accusers, who were not identified by name in the joint media investigation, include one who said she was sexually assaulted during a relationship with him when she was 16. Another woman says Brand raped her in Los Angeles in 2012. Corky Siemaszko is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital. ",

Loren, the 89-year-old Italian film legend, had a successful operation for a leg fracture after she fell in her Swiss home Sunday, her agent said. The agent, Andrea Giusti, said in an email Monday that Loren fell in a bathroom and that surgery was performed later in the day. The operation \u201cwent very well and now we only need to wait,\u201d Giusti said. Loren broke both her hip and a thigh bone, the agent said. When Loren will be discharged from the hospital wasn't immediately clear. Loren, who celebrated her 89th birthday last week, has lived in a Swiss villa near Lake Geneva for decades. She appeared this month, looking radiant, with Italian designer Giorgio Armani in Venice, Italy, at a fashion show held on the sidelines of the city\u2019s annual film festival. Loren was scheduled to appear at a restaurant that bears her name in Bari, a city in southern Italy, but her fall canceled the event. Her agent said Loren gave the restaurant the right to use her name and image. Loren became the first performer to win an Academy Award for a foreign language role in 1961 and took home an Honorary Award, or lifetime achievement award, from the Motion Picture Academy in 1990.

        "title": "Try Guys' Keith and Becky Habersberger stuns fans with surprise baby",
        "content": "Try Guys fans are bewildered after founding member Keith Habersberger and Try Wife Becky Habersberger just apparently hard launched a whole baby. The couple on Sunday dropped the same photo on Instagram of the two standing together with an infant cradled in Keith\u2019s arms. In true hard launch fashion, their captions \u2014 \u201cBaby baby \u2764\ufe0f\u201d and \u201cHey baby \u2764\ufe0f\u201d \u2014 were clear and concise yet somehow also cryptic. \u201cSir you can\u2019t just drop this and expect me not to scream??? Is this baby yours??? Whose baby is this?? I need context you\u2019re stressing me out,\u201d a user commented on Keith\u2019s post. \u201cNEW TRYBABY JUST DROPPED ?!?!?!\u201d another commented. \u201cWait who\u2019s baby is this? Did you guys Kylie Jenner us?\u201d a user wrote on Becky\u2019s post. \u201cOr is this just a fun picture with someone\u2019s baby? Lol.\u201d The surprise quickly began making its way around the internet. The Habersbergers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In internet parlance, a \u201chard launch\u201d is an explicit social media announcement of some personal news, usually a romantic relationship, that has been kept completely quiet about for a significant period of time. It\u2019s the reverse of a \u201csoft launch,\u201d in which someone drops subtle hints online to generate curiosity and build anticipation among followers. While thousands expressed their astonishment, some commenters claimed they suspected a pregnancy all along. Over the past few months, several Reddit threads had also shared speculation about a potential Habersberger pregnancy, drawing attention to suspicious behavior or camera angles in recent Try Guys content. \u201cHer stomach is conveniently covered in every single shot and Rachel gave her a separate, slightly different colored drink when the others were drinking whiskey sours,\u201d a Redditor wrote in a thread. \u201cThere\u2019s been speculation for a while since we haven\u2019t seen full body shots of her in months, but I\u2019m officially convinced! I\u2019d bet money that they\u2019ll have a baby by September.\u201d But fans generally encouraged one another to keep quiet to respect the couple\u2019s privacy. \u201cI think you\u2019re coming from a good place, but it\u2019s not appropriate to speculate about people\u2019s pregnancy status or body in general,\u201d a commenter wrote in another Reddit thread. \u201cBecky herself has talked multiple times about how speculation like this is hurtful and inappropriate to her.\u201d For years, Becky Habersberger had been open online about her preference that people not make speculative comments on strangers\u2019 pregnancy status. Now that the speculation is put to rest, fans are eager to celebrate the family's newest addition. \u201cKeith and Becky having a baby in 2023 was 100% in my bingo card, and I\u2019m so happy for them!\u201d an X poster wrote. \u201cSo happy she got the pregnancy she wanted, of not sharing and people respecting her privacy until they were ready to introduce the baby to the world \ud83d\udc9c\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Writers strike negotiations hung up on language over AI, sources say",
        "content": "Hollywood writers and producers have made \"major progress\" in negotiations to end the strike that has gone on for 145 days, but a major sticking point has been language over the use of artificial intelligence, two sources familiar with the negotiations said Saturday. Studio executives were not present for the talks Saturday, which lasted eight hours, the sources said, and negotiations ended without a deal. The two sides \u2014 the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers \u2014 said in a joint statement that bargaining would resume Sunday. The AMPTP is a trade group that bargains for the major studios and streaming services. (The group represents NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.) The back-to-back weekend meetings may be a sign of hope amid a strike that ended some television programs before their seasons ended and postponed the annual fall season of debuts and returns. Writers have complained that they have been shorted when it comes to their share of streaming revenue. They also want increased royalties, or residual payments, and protection against the possibility studios could use artificial intelligence to handle some writing duties and to cut them out of jobs. The sides went to the table Wednesday for discussions that took a powerful turn Thursday when studio heads joined marathon talks that lasted more than 10 hours, a source familiar with the discussions said afterward. Disney\u2019s Bob Iger, Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s David Zaslav and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal Studio Group Chairman Donna Langley were present, that source said. At the time, the source said there was a sense the two sides were \u201cinching closer\u201d to a deal. Actors represented by SAG-AFTRA joined the picket line in July in a separate dispute that continues. Chloe Melas is an entertainment correspondent for NBC News.

        "title": "Russell Brand speaks for the first time since sexual assault allegations",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Russell Brand has made his first public comments following the publication of several sexual abuse allegations against him, and attacked the British government and social media platforms for shutting down his ability to make money from his accounts. \u201cObviously, it has been an extraordinary and distressing week and I thank you very much for your support and for questioning the information that you have been presented with,\u201d Brand said Friday in a video posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.  It was the first time that the comedian turned influencer has commented publicly after British newspapers, including The Times, The Sunday Times and U.K. broadcaster Channel 4\u2019s \u201cDispatches,\u201d reported allegations that he had sexually and emotionally abused four women.  Brand, 48, was accused of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse by four women. One of them said she was 16 (the age of consent in the U.K.) and Brand was 30 when they began a relationship that included abuse and sexual assault. A fifth woman has accused Brand of flashing his genitals at her. The comedian turned wellness influencer has denied the allegations, saying that all his relationships have been consensual. In a video posted to his social media accounts before the publication of the allegations and the program called \u201cRussell Brand: In Plain Sight,\u201d he said he refuted what he called \u201cvery serious allegations.\u201d NBC News has not spoken to any of the accusers nor independently confirmed any of the allegations against Brand.  Aside from thanking his supporters, his second video focused mostly on criticism of the British government, which he said had \u201casked big tech platforms to censor our online content, and some online platforms have complied with that request.  \u201cWhat you may not know is that this happens in the context of the online safety bill, which is a piece of U.K. legislation that grants sweeping surveillance and censorship powers, and it\u2019s a law that has already been passed,\u201d he added.  YouTube blocked Russell Brand from making money from its platform, and the BBC pulled some of Brand's shows from its online streaming service. His management agency, Tavistock Wood, said Sunday that it had dropped Brand as a client after saying it had been \u201chorribly misled\u201d by him. His former employers at Channel 4 and the BBC have said they are conducting investigations into the allegations. Brand has also postponed upcoming U.K. comedy shows and is suspending the end of his current comedy tour, \u201cBipolarisation.\u201d It was unclear whether it would be rescheduled. While the U.K. government does not appear to have tried to censor Brand, Caroline Dinenage, the chair of the British Parliament\u2019s Media and Sport Committee, did write to Rumble \u2014 a site that attracts creators who tend to subscribe to more right-wing views \u2014 to say she was \u201cconcerned\u201d that Brand could profit from them.  In a statement, Rumble called the letter \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said that it would refuse to \u201cjoin a cancel culture mob.\u201d Lawmakers have been debating the Online Safety Bill, which Brand referred to in his video, since it was first published as a draft in May 2021. Britain\u2019s Parliament signed off on it Tuesday.  The sprawling piece of legislation will require social media platforms to take down illegal content, including that depicting child sexual abuse, hate speech, terrorism, revenge porn and posts promoting self-harm. The platforms will also have to take steps to stop such content from appearing in the first place and give users more controls, including the ability to block anonymous trolls. Companies that don\u2019t comply will face fines of up to 18 million pounds ($22 million), or 10% of annual global sales, whichever is greater, and senior managers at tech companies will also face criminal prosecution and prison time if they fail to respond to information requests from British regulators. They will also be held criminally liable if their company fails to comply with regulators\u2019 notices about child sexual abuse and exploitation. Technically, the bill has not become law because it has yet to receive Royal Assent, King Charles III\u2019s agreement, which is required to turn a bill into an Act of Parliament, but this is strictly a formality. Brand, who has spent the past several years building his YouTube audience to more than 6 million followers, and his career as an influencer and speaker while peddling false conspiracy theories on the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other topics, went on to attack the Trusted News Initiative, a partnership of international news organizations that works to find solutions to tackle disinformation.  \u201cTrust is the last thing you should be offering,\u201d he said, adding that the group\u2019s aim was \u201cto target, control, choke and shut down independent media organizations.\u201d Larissa Gao is a fellow on NBC\u2019s Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.

        "title": "Russell Brand allegations put Britain's toxic 'lad culture' back in the spotlight",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 The allegations of rape, sexual assault and grooming against Russell Brand have provoked sudden soul-searching in the United Kingdom. While Brand denies the allegations, saying all of his sexual encounters were consensual, few can reject what was broadcast to millions and plastered across front pages: the toxic and violently misogynist media culture of the 2000s in which Brand was a peacocking protagonist. And so it\u2019s not just Brand\u2019s career or his former employers that are facing new scrutiny, but the \u201900s as a whole, with Britain confronting the reality that this ugliness may lurk much closer to the surface of public life than many realized or admitted. In recent days much of the revulsion has come from viewers and readers, often with themselves, at being reminded of just how extreme the dominant tenor of entertainment was in the country not so long ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a real culture shock \u2014 a lot of things that felt normal at the time feel very abnormal now,\u201d said Sarah Ditum, a newspaper columnist and author of \u201cToxic: Women, Fame and the Noughties,\u201d which will be published in the United States in January. It was only when she started researching her book two years ago that she \u201crealized how alien that time feels.\u201d The \u201cnoughties\u201d is the British name for the \u201900s, also known as the aughts in the U.S. It was a time when, in 2006, Brand joked onstage about enjoying oral sex violent enough to make a woman\u2019s mascara run. A year later he and fellow comedian and friend Noel Fielding riffed about rape during an end-of-year comedy special. And in 2010 British actor Danny Dyer suggested in his \u201cagony uncle\u201d column that a jilted man should \u201ccut his ex\u2019s face, then no one will want her.\u201d The bounds of acceptability extended to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d star Emma Watson leaving her 18th birthday dinner to find paparazzi lying on the sidewalk to capture upskirt photographs. Singer Charlotte Church had her 16th birthday marked by influential radio DJ Chris Moyles offering on air to \u201clead her through the forest of sexuality.\u201d And the nation\u2019s top comedy show, \u201cLittle Britain,\u201d was replete with blackface and jokes about LGBTQ people and people with disabilities. The show\u2019s stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, have apologized.  None of this appears to have harmed the careers of those involved. Today, Fielding presents the internationally beloved \u201cGreat British Baking Show.\u201d Moyles has an eponymous program on Radio X. And Dyer was until recently a leading star in Britain\u2019s iconic soap opera \u201cEastEnders.\u201d NBC News has contacted Fielding\u2019s and Moyles\u2019 agents for comment. Dyer wrote in his autobiography that he regretted his \u201ctasteless joke,\u201d saying he never thought the magazine would publish it. Overt misogyny existed in the \u201990s and, of course, before. But what made the \u201900s unique was its particular tone of cruelty and \u201cnihilism,\u201d according to Ditum. The so-called lad mags launched in the previous decade had featured scantily clad women, but also quality factual journalism and humor. What changed? The nascent internet, which blasted \u201ca firehose of uncensored, unmoderated content into people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said, from illegal downloads of music and films to extreme, gonzo-style pornography and revenge porn. Then came social media, unleashing \u201ca turbocharged version of the media and tabloid sexism we were already used to online,\u201d said Laura Bates, author of \u201cMen Who Hate Women\u201d and founder in 2012 of the Everyday Sexism Project.  Platforms like Facebook and Twitter, launched in 2004 and 2006, \u201cenabled everyday women, not just celebrities, to be targeted with the same slut shaming, body image pressure, objectification and sexual harassment that we\u2019d seen flourish offline in the \u201990s,\u201d she said. A version of all this was happening in the U.S., of course, where stars like Britney Spears were ogled as teenagers before being harangued and destroyed by those same forces. In fact, Ditum attributes some of the decade\u2019s cultural cruelty to America\u2019s defining event: 9/11. \u201cBecause so much of the culture industries are based in Manhattan, 9/11 had a really direct, traumatizing effect,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have this huge cataclysmic event that no one is emotionally equipped to deal with\u201d and \u201cit feeds into this really apocalyptic, end-of-the-world feeling in the gossip culture.\u201d Piers Morgan, then editor of The Mirror newspaper, was quoted in The Guardian four months later saying the attacks had \u201cconcentrated my mind and made me realise\u201d the media didn\u2019t have to \u201csuck up\u201d to celebrities anymore. It \u201cempowered us to put celebrities back in their box.\u201d In practice, Ditum said, what ensued was less an era of legitimate scrutiny and more a \u201cnihilistic celebration of destruction\u201d in the media, one where the feeling was: \u201cThe world has burned, and people wanted to see individual women burn within that.\u201d Britain has always had its own particular brand of risque humor, often exporting it to the States, where stars like Brand, who had a brief stint in Hollywood movies, shocked its traditionally more puritanical audiences. \u201cBritish comedy has always been bawdy, raunchy and winking,\u201d said Wynter Mitchell-Rohrbaugh, a cultural commentator and podcaster based in Los Angeles. \u201cThe audience takes it in, they don\u2019t think too much of it, but then when you get into real-life consequences, real-life allegations,\u201d such as those leveled at Brand, \u201cit pivots and changes things a lot.\u201d Brand was endorsed not only by broadcasters and their audiences but leading politicians keen to cash in on his cultural capital. In 2015, then opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband interviewed Brand as part of his election campaign, something he said this week he regrets. Brand\u2019s former employers, the BBC and Channel 4, pledged to investigate their processes and have pulled some of his work. (Channel 4 commissioned some of Brand\u2019s former shows before airing last weekend\u2019s expos\u00e9 against him.) Tim Davie, BBC director-general, said it was investigating allegations by Brand\u2019s then-16-year-old girlfriend that a company car collected her from school and took her to the star\u2019s house. \u201cThis industry has definitely faced significant issues with regard to a deep power imbalance in certain places, between so-called talent, presenters, and others working on shows,\u201d Davie told a Q&A with staff that was released by the organization\u2019s press office. But as much as audiences, broadcasters and celebrities themselves profess to have moved past those bad old days, many within the industry roll their eyes at the idea that things have changed substantively. \u201cWe know the entertainment industry is absolutely rife, and within that the comedy industry is the least regulated,\u201d said Stevie Martin, a comedian who has participated in WhatsApp groups where women warn each other of industry predators.  \u201cThere are so few structures\u201d to protect people, she added, \u201cAnd many people involved in those structures have obviously looked the other way.\u201d While Brand\u2019s overt style may not wash now, Martin and others say that the same alleged activity is just better hidden today. It\u2019s more common to hear about men \u201cwho go out of their way to appear feminist\u201d but then act inappropriately in private, she said, \u201cand that to me is more terrifying.\u201d And even if there has been a softening of the cultural rhetoric, there has been little change when it comes to metrics such as rape conviction rates in Britain, with charges brought in less than 2% of reported cases, according to the charity Rape Crisis England & Wales. \u201cWe continue to like to cling as a society to the notion that things have changed and are constantly getting better,\u201d Bates said. But \u201cI think we have a lot of the same problems in 2023; we just struggle to recognize them when they are under our noses.\u201d She added that \u201cit is baffling to see so many people talking about how normalized sexism was in the media in the 2000s as if this is now a different era.\u201d Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.

        "title": "What started with Spanglish has become a whole new English dialect in this U.S. city",
        "content": "Growing up as a first-generation Cuban American in Miami, Ismael Llano never thought twice about the way he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where if everybody speaks the same way, then it\u2019s not odd,\u201d said Llano, who was born and raised in Miami toggling between Spanish and English as the son and grandson of Cuban immigrants. That \u201csame way\u201d of speaking includes phrases that aren\u2019t usually used in English, such as \u201cget down from the car\u201d instead of \u201cget out of the car\u201d or \u201cmarried with\u201d instead of \u201cmarried to\u201d or \u201cthrow a photo\u201d instead of \u201ctake a photo.\u201d It wasn't until he was in high school or college, Llano said, \"where I started to realize ... we\u2019re the ones who are doing something different down here with the language.\" It turns out those Miami-specific English phrases evolved from direct translations of Spanish: \"Bajarse del carro\" directly translates to \"get down from the car.\" Llano, who co-hosts the podcast \u201cPero, Let Me Tell You,\u201d focused on news, politics and culture from a Cuban American perspective, interviewed a guest last month, Phillip Carter, whose study this year has made national headlines \u2014 and confirmed what residents like Llano have long felt: There is a distinct \u201cMiami Dialect.\u201d For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. The way Spanish and English have intertwined in Miami after the arrival of many Cubans half a century ago has gone beyond what some may call \u201cSpanglish\u201d and evolved into a new English-language dialect entirely, said Carter, a professor of linguistics and English at Florida International University. Carter studied groups of native Spanish speakers and native English speakers and found that what made the \"Miami Dialect\" was the use of \u201ccalques,\u201d or \u201cborrowings.\u201d Calques occur when a Spanish phrase is directly translated into English \u2014 like \u201cget down from the car.\u201d While the phrases are more common among Spanish-dominant speakers, even second-, third- and fourth-generation native English speakers in Miami use them \u2014 which explains why the \"dialect\" is so prevalent. \u201cWhen you have a situation such as that which took place in Miami, where the immigrant group becomes the local majority, things can get passed down to first-language speakers of the language, namely the children of immigrants, and then their grandchildren,\u201d Carter said. In the early 1960s, many Cubans left their country after Fidel Castro\u2019s communist takeover, many of them settling in Miami. Cuban Americans and other Latino immigrants have been instrumental to the city\u2019s economic and social growth. Spanish is everywhere, and some refer to Miami as Latin America\u2019s northernmost city. Jose Urbino, a Miami native and fitness trainer, grew up speaking Spanish and English and switching between the languages frequently. He said he realized that everyday phrases in Miami weren\u2019t always commonplace in other places across the country. \u201cThere are times when we go to other cities and I\u2019ll say some weird Miami phrase,\u201d he said. For example, Urbino will say he\u2019s just \u201ceating sh-t\u201d to mean he\u2019s just \u201csitting around doing nothing of value,\" he said. Though it may sound like an odd thing to say, the phrase is a direct translation of a very common Spanish expression, \u201ccomiendo mierda,\u201d which is used among Cuban Americans to mean just \u201changing out.\u201d \u201cThere are tons of those types of phrases out here, that are those very literal Spanish-to-English translations,\u201d said Urbino, who said being bilingual has been crucial to his career. \u201cThey are very much our own thing.\u201d Other words and phrases Urbino pointed out as commonly heard in Miami even though they may not be unique to the city include \u201cirregardless\u201d instead of \u201cregardless,\u201d as well as \u201cpero (but) like,\u201d and \u201csuper good.\u201d Ilan Stavans, the Lewis-Sebring professor of humanities and Latin American and Latino culture at Amherst College and the author of \u201cSpanglish: The Making of a New American Language\u201d and \u201cThe People\u2019s Tongue: Americans and the English Language,\u201d sees the evolution of language in Spanish- and English-speaking U.S. cities like Miami as an integral part of the country\u2019s identity. \u201cHow American English changes is a thermometer measuring the transformations of who we are as a nation,\u201d said Stavans, who wasn\u2019t surprised by Carter\u2019s findings in Miami. \u201cThe United States has a number of major cities with pronounced Latino presence. Aside from Miami, these include San Antonio, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Chicago and New York,\" he said. \u201cAfter similar studies are done in most of them,\" he said, \"it will be clear that each has a similar yet unique dialect, depending on where the Hispanic immigrants originated from.\" English has influenced languages around the world, including Spanish in the U.S.: In Texas, researchers have found Spanish expressions that are direct translations from the English, like \"h\u00e1blame p'atr\u00e1s,\" a direct translation of \"call me back.\" But in the case of Miami, where Spanish has changed English expressions, other linguists agree that the city's specific history has led to this moment. \u201cThere is indeed a sociolect of Miami English that is commonly heard here in Miami, and that\u2019s especially so among U.S.-born Latinos who are English dominant,\u201d said the author of \u201cSpanish in Miami: Sociolinguistic Dimensions of Postmodernity,\u201d Andrew Lynch, a professor of modern languages and literatures at the University of Miami who has studied Spanish for over 20 years. \u201cSo this is not about speaking Spanglish. This is about speaking a characteristic variety of English that would sound different than someone from New York or Colorado or California.\u201d Urbino recalled that once he realized his Miami language was different, his younger self tried to assimilate a more \u201cproper\u201d way of speaking. \"We thought that there were all of these rules that we were supposed to follow to try to be like good citizens or good Americans. So we would hear this sort of stuff,\" he said, referring to the Miami phrases characteristic of Miami, \"and just be like, \u2018Oh, no, that\u2019s not how that goes. That\u2019s not right.'\" Carter said he hopes his study opens people\u2019s eyes to the vast variability of language in general, arguing that for too long, people have been told the way they communicate is \u201cincorrect\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d \u201cI think people are tired of being told that the way their mother speaks is bad or that the forms that they use in their home are stupid,\" Carter said. \"Or they\u2019re tired of seeing their children go to school and be held back based on their dialect or their multilingualism.\" What's encouraging about the \"Miami dialect\" is that it shows that in Miami, where Latinos are the majority, the use of Spanish and Spanglish has been widely accepted. \u201cYou do need people to reflect on it positively for it to stick around. If it\u2019s totally negative, then it probably won\u2019t stick,\u201d Carter said about the city's distinct dialect. \u201cSo there\u2019s evidence that people use them. And there\u2019s evidence that they are positively evaluated, which leads us to believe that these are features of a dialogue that will likely be around for some time.\u201d For Miami natives like Urbino and Llano, the new study offers a breath of fresh air. \u201cNow that somebody gave it a name and it\u2019s been studied \u2014 that makes it official, that means that I\u2019m not a weirdo anymore,\u201d Llano said. \u201cThere is a beauty to feeling validation in that way.\u201d Urbino said the influential convergence between Spanish and English is here to stay \u2014 both in his life and in Miami. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that there will not be an even greater influence like that here in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cMiami will be a Spanish-dominated city until the waters take us.\u201d Natalie Bennett is an associate producer for NBC News.

        "title": "Power, influence and scandal: Rupert Murdoch's long-lasting legacy in the U.K.",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 In July 1995, Tony Blair was so popular in Britain that he was considered prime minister-in-waiting a full two years before his crowning election. Yet, he still thought it necessary to fly 25 hours to the other side of the world to make his case to one man: Rupert Murdoch. Blair\u2019s trip to Hayman Island, an Australian resort off the Great Barrier Reef \u2014 and return to London the next day \u2014 is emblematic of the singular, and critics would say pernicious, sway Murdoch has held over leaders in Britain and in his native Australia for decades. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been going all the way around the world\u201d if it \u201chadn\u2019t been a very deliberate and, again, very strategic decision that I was going to go and try and persuade them,\u201d Blair told a 2012  public inquiry into media ethics, recalling his Hayman Island trip where he addressed the media mogul\u2019s News Corp. conference. \u201cThe minimum objective was to stop them tearing us to pieces, and the maximum objective was, if possible, to open the way to support.\u201d After Murdoch, 92, announced Thursday that he would step down as chairman of Fox Corp. and News Corp., much of the debate in the United States has been over the influence Fox News has had on American politics, one that Media Matters, a liberal watchdog group that monitors conservative media, called a legacy \u201cof deceit, destruction, and death.\u201d But long before he turned his attention to U.S. broadcasting, he had grown a modest Australian newspaper business into a print empire that bitterly divided opinion from Canberra to London. Murdoch\u2019s domain also included a 39% controlling stake in the British broadcaster Sky, before it was bought by NBC News\u2019 parent company, Comcast, in 2018.  The divisions are bitter and polarized. Supporters herald his love for journalism and credit him with saving the British newspaper industry by smashing powerful print unions in the mid-1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s got inky fingers; he loves newspapers,\u201d said Guto Harri, who worked for Murdoch as the director of communications and corporate affairs for News U.K., the publisher of The Sun, The Times and Sunday Times, between 2012 and 2015. \u201cHe will have been in the office earlier than you in the morning,\u201d said Harri, who was also a senior press adviser to Boris Johnson, first when he was mayor of London and later as prime minister. \u201cHe will have read all the day\u2019s newspapers, and then he would just start wandering round the building asking people questions, whether that was the editorial staff, finance or people who drove the delivery trucks. He was across the whole thing.\u201d Critics believe Murdoch debased rather than rescued the industry: The phone-hacking scandal, which saw the voicemails of hundreds of high-profile people intercepted by journalists, and eventually led to the shuttering of his News of the World tabloid in 2011; the topless \u201cPage 3\u201d girls who adorned The Sun until 2015; and a general disregard for press ethics, privacy and accuracy. \u201cI see absolutely no upside to Murdoch\u2019s years in the U.K.,\u201d said Steven Barnett, a communications professor at London\u2019s University of Westminster. \u201cI think he\u2019s undermined journalistic standards,\u201d said Barnett, a Murdoch critic who is on the board of Hacked Off, a group set up after the phone-hacking scandal that campaigns for press regulation. He added that Murdoch had overseen \u201ca culture of disinformation, bullying, misogyny, homophobia and racism\u201d and having \u201can entirely negative impact on British culture and British democracy.\u201d Asked for comment on the criticism against Murdoch, News Corp. pointed NBC News toward this line in Murdoch\u2019s Thursday statement: \u201cElites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.\u201d Few who encountered Murdoch deny he was a \u201cbig, bad b------,\u201d as Blair\u2019s spin doctor and media enforcer Alistair Campbell wrote in his memoirs, \u201cThe Blair Years,\u201d recalling a conversation between his former boss and then-Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. In Australia, Murdoch owned more than half the country\u2019s newspapers. Back home, many revere what is easily the country\u2019s most successful and influential global business story. \u201cHe has been in lots of ways a controversial figure, but an influential figure too,\u201d Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. But there are plenty others, including former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said Friday that Murdoch had \u201cdone enormous damage to the democratic world\u201d \u2014 particularly the U.S. \u2014 and accused him of peddling \u201canger-tainment.\u201d In the U.K., the correlation between Murdoch\u2019s blessing and political power is so striking that The Sun, one of the most read papers in Britain, has had a 100% record of backing winning candidates since 1979. The apotheosis of this came after the ruling Conservative Party won the 1992 general election when many had predicted defeat. The Sun\u2019s front page declared \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won It\u201d the next day, following years of ridiculing the opposition Labour Party. Murdoch\u2019s supporters say it\u2019s entirely proper for prospective rulers to make their case to newspaper proprietors and editors, who represent millions of readers and thus the views of the country. Critics believe these tycoons are often advocating for their own interests, not those of their readers. While Blair has always denied he had an unspoken agreement with Murdoch, one of his special advisers, Lance Price, wrote in his book \u201cWhere Power Lies: Prime Ministers v the Media\u201d that \u201ca deal had been done, although with nothing in writing,\u201d which ensured that if \u201cMurdoch were left to pursue his business interests in peace, he would give Labour a fair wind.\u201d The anxiety over Murdoch\u2019s controlling influence has waned, alongside the decline of newspaper dominance and the rise of social media. But few believe his handing chairmanship to his older son, Lachlan Murdoch, will mean he\u2019s out of the picture entirely. \u201cHe\u2019s made it pretty clear that he\u2019s going to be keeping a beady eye on junior, so the idea of him stepping away and letting Lachlan run the show entirely as he wants to is I\u2019m afraid for the birds,\u201d said Barnett at the University of Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about money, it\u2019s about self-enrichment and enrichment for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I suspect that he will be quite happy to keep steamroller over any sense of journalistic ethics that might interfere with that.\u201d Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.

        "title": "Social media-famous dentist faces backlash on TikTok after women claim he sent inappropriate messages",
        "content": "A Texas dentist who is known for his brash, edgy humor on social media, where he has hundreds of thousands of followers, has been accused of bullying and sexual harassment by several women who say they received inappropriate messages from his official social media accounts. Dr. Kenneth Wilstead, who goes by @DrKennySmiles on Instagram and @DrKennySmilesOfficial on TikTok, often shares his \u201csmile makeovers\u201d on social media. The videos typically show a person in his dentist chair discussing how their teeth got to the state they\u2019re in, and then the video cuts to the patient gazing at their new, perfect smile. The videos rack up hundreds of thousands of views on platforms like TikTok, where Wilstead has more than 700,000 followers, and on Instagram, where he has more than half a million followers.  But on Aug. 31, when Wilstead shared a callout for a new reality show, some women online started to raise their concerns about how he treats his female patients, as well as women who seek out his dental help.  NBC News spoke with four women about their experiences with Wilstead, who is 43. Two women who were prospective patients said they received sexually explicit messages sent from his account but never met with him in person. Another woman said she received bullying messages from his account on social media. A fourth woman said she filed a complaint against him after he swore at her and told her that her dental problems were in her head. Last year, a patient of Wilstead\u2019s sued him for medical malpractice, claiming he touched her inappropriately. A jury trial is scheduled for the case, according to a 14th District Court docket.  Wilstead is the only dentist listed under the \u201cAbout us\u201d page on the website for his practice, Smile Again Dental. It\u2019s unclear whether other dentists work there. In a lengthy email statement to NBC News on Friday, Wilstead said, \"I have staff who help handle my social media. \"The character I play both online and in my office has been something I have used to break the tension of a stressful experience and unfortunately sometimes people who don\u2019t have full context feel like I cross(ed) the line and it\u2019s their right to have their own opinions,\" he wrote. \"I respect that right.\" However, he said he believes \"The current situation stems from a blowup of a few written comments.\"  In regard to the legal action being taken against him, he said \u201ca woman is suing me and falsely accusing me of touching or grabbing her buttocks.\u201d He wrote that he is \u201ctotally innocent of any inappropriate touching of that woman.\u201d A spokesperson for Meta said it removed two of Wilstead\u2019s videos on Instagram after receiving a request for comment from NBC News, saying the videos violated the platform\u2019s community guidelines. The spokesperson also said that, after reviewing Wilstead\u2019s account, it has placed him on a short-term ban from using Instagram Live, citing repeated rule-breaking. A spokesperson for TikTok did not provide NBC News with a comment about Wilstead\u2019s content. Taylyn Peaco was one of the first people to speak out on TikTok about Wilstead allegedly being sexually inappropriate in messages. Her video gained traction this week after it was shared by Ophelia Nichols, often referred to as \u201cMama Tot\u201d on TikTok.  Nichols, who has more than 12 million followers on the platform, had previously elevated Wilstead\u2019s content after the dentist offered to fix for free a tooth she\u2019d broken. In her first video about him, which is no longer on the platform, she suggested Wilstead offer his services to someone more in need. He later fixed the teeth of three people for free. Peaco, 27, told NBC News that she had jumped at the opportunity for a free smile makeover because in the past she had been quoted as needing $60,000 worth of dental work. She posted an audition video, then messaged Wilstead on Instagram.  You took my most vulnerable moment and one I would never post online, and that was supposed to be funny? -TAYLYN PEACO, ON WILSTEAD\u2019S ALLEGED REMARK TO HER At first, Peaco received a message that said Wilstead would respond to her shortly. Then she received a follow-up message that appeared to be from Wilstead himself, in which he explained he would be traveling to potential patient\u2019s homes to decide if they were right for his show. NBC News has reviewed the messages. \u201cPlease send me 10 more pictures of your size shape and stuff like that please. This show is about a lot of things beyond teeth. So that will help me,\u201d the message read, adding, \u201cClothing optional,\u201d along with a skull emoji. \u201cYou took my most vulnerable moment and one I would never post online, and that was supposed to be funny?\u201d Peaco said, adding that she felt taken advantage of by Wilstead\u2019s alleged remark. Annely Timmerman, 32, said she was inspired to come forward after seeing others, including Peaco, share their experiences. Timmerman was one of the makeover hopefuls who posted an audition to TikTok, seeking to become a patient of Wilstead's. In the audition video, Timmerman cries as she describes the genetic condition she suffers from, called oligodontia, which results in missing teeth.  After posting her video, Timmerman realized that Wilstead followed her on Instagram. She sent him a direct message asking if he had seen her video and apologized for being an \u201cugly crier.\u201d A response from Wilstead\u2019s verified account, which has been viewed by NBC News, reads, \u201cJust wanted to have sex with you. It\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cMy message from him had sat in my Instagram messages for a couple of days before I ever said anything about it, because it is intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I wanted to be like, \u2018Who the hell does this guy think he is?\u2019 but he has such a huge platform.\u201d In response to the \u201cclothing optional\u201d message allegation, Wilstead referred to his staff. \u201cWe were running a contest and one of them made the comment \u2018clothing optional,\u2019 knowing how I sometimes joke with my patients,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe same is true of the comment that I wanted to have sex with the woman who called herself \u2018ugly.\u2019 It was a misjudgment of my staff trying to impersonate the way they thought I might speak. I don\u2019t defend either of the statements which were in poor taste.\u201d He also said his patients know that he makes videos and use their photos before and after to show results \u201cbecause they sign off on my right to do so. Again, this is no problem for almost all of my patients.\u201d In the aftermath of Timmerman and Peaco\u2019s videos, many began resurfacing some of Wilstead\u2019s previous content, saying how his behavior in some of his videos is problematic. In an Aug. 17 video on his Instagram page, Wilstead is heard making a joke about his sex life to a 90-year-old patient and the people who came in with her. In a Sept. 11 video on Instagram, he calls a patient\u2019s teeth \u201cdisgusting.\u201d A spokesperson for Meta said that it removed the Sept. 11 video after a request for comment made by NBC News. The Texas Board of Dental Examiners lists three disciplinary actions on Wilstead\u2019s license page. The discipline took place in 2015, 2019 and 2021.  The 2015 action stemmed from Wilstead prescribing controlled substances for nondental reasons, according to an agreed settlement order. Wilstead was required to pay a fine, take continued education courses and surrender his Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of Safety permits for controlled substances, among other punishments.  The 2019 disciplinary action stemmed from an incident in which Wilstead was found to have not provided the minimum standard of dental care, which included failing to do periodontal probing as well as failing to take cementation radiographs while fitting crowns on two teeth. The board also found Wilstead failed to keep and maintain proper records and abandoned a patient, according to an agreed settlement order.  The final disciplinary action states again that Wilstead failed to provide the minimum standard of care, failed to maintain proper records and failed to provide the board with a business record affidavit, according to an agreed settlement order.  The Texas Board of Dental Examiners declined to comment on the allegations against Wilstead or the nature of his content. The Texas Board of Dental Examiners, which oversees disciplinary action as well as licensing, said it could not disclose the number of complaints. It\u2019s unclear how many complaints have been filed against Wilstead in total.  However, the board referred NBC News to the public license search portion of its website, where disciplinary action is viewable.  Amanda Moore, 43, was a complainant behind the 2019 agreed settlement order. Her complaint stemmed from a Feb. 1, 2017, appointment. Moore, who says she suffers from debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder, said she had begun visiting a practice in which Wilstead worked at the time, for care she could not afford at her regular dentist. In a complaint dated Feb. 25, 2017, which was sent via email to the Texas Board of Dental Examiners in an email dated March 5, 2017, Moore claims Wilstead exploded at her after she came to his office worried about a dark spot on her teeth.  In her complaint, Moore says Wilstead told her, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here wasting my f\u2014--- time\u201d and told her the dark spot on her teeth was \u201cin your f\u2014--- head.\u201d  The 2019 agreed settlement order states that part of the disciplinary action is being sanctioned because Wilstead \u201cabandoned\u201d a patient on Feb. 1, 2017 \u2014 the date Moore included in her complaint as the day of her appointment with Wilstead.  \u201cWho would find this ethical? I mean, doctors and dentists have to take the Hippocratic Oath,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis is despicable.\u201d Wilstead said all three disciplinary actions \u201cwere for minor situations\u201d and \u201chave been expunged.\u201d \u201cI learned from each situation,\u201d he wrote in his statement. Last year, Wilstead was sued for medical malpractice by a woman who alleged that he made inappropriate comments and groped her buttocks. She also alleged in the lawsuit that she saw photos taken of a different patient\u2019s cleavage, according to the lawsuit. That case is ongoing. The plaintiff in the case declined to comment to NBC News. In addition to generally denying the woman\u2019s allegations, regarding the inappropriate photos of her chest, Wilstead said \u201cthis is the first time I have heard that false accusation.\u201d Lauren Spaulding, 30, said she felt bullied by Wilstead when she reached out seeking dental treatment in February, after losing teeth during two pregnancies. In their exchange, which was viewed by NBC News, Spaulding sent him images of her teeth and asked for an estimate. When she misunderstood a message about the quote, he allegedly called her a \u201cdips\u2014.\u201d Spaulding said she later fell into a depression after her interaction with Wilstead, lost her job, began taking antidepressants and struggled with suicidal ideation.  \u201cIt just takes one harsh word to make someone go over the line,\u201d Spaulding said. \u201cIt could just take someone as vile as him pushing someone over the edge, you know?\" She and the other women said they hope that by speaking out others won\u2019t be subjected to the misbehavior they\u2019ve experienced.  \u201cWhat if I was like a little 19-year-old and more brittle and more vulnerable?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that gets me.\u201d In his email statement, Wilstead said he doesn't \"recall\" the incident Spaulding alluded to. \"If someone wants to complain now to be part of the vocal minority on social media to make them feel like they are part of something, I get it,\" he wrote. \"That is the nature of the society we live in. It seems like a feeding frenzy of people wanting to join the Hate Dr. Kenny Club & that is their right.\" However, he said, he is \"disheartened by this situation.\" Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

        "title": "She'll be the first Afro Latina on a U.S. quarter. Here's Celia Cruz, remembered.",
        "content": "In 2024, the late Celia Cruz will be the first Afro Latina face on a U.S. quarter, part of the American Women Quarters series that also honors suffragettes, civil rights defenders, abolitionists and scientists who changed history. That Cruz is part of that storied list is no surprise to the legions of fans around the world that recognize the lasting legacy of the \"Queen of Salsa\" as one of the first truly global crossover Latin artists. Cruz, who won several Grammy and Latin Grammy awards, received the National Medal of Arts, among the nation's highest honors, in 1994. She has a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame and one on Miami's famous Calle Ocho, and has a school in New York City named after her. Twenty years after she died from brain cancer complications at age 78, Cruz is remembered by those close to her as a nurturing friend who spent hours answering fan letters by hand, who loved to cook Cuban food once a year when she wasn't touring the world, and who was still humbled and surprised when thousands of fans attended a concert she gave at a festival in Finland, \"close to the North Pole.\" Noticias Telemundo spoke with Omer Pardillo Cid, her longtime manager for almost 30 years and executor of her estate, as well as with photographer Alexis Rodr\u00edguez and stylist Tico Torres. The last two introduced themselves to Cruz when they were living and working in London and went on to photograph and style her for years, forming a deep friendship. Many decades before Bad Bunny, Karol G or JBalvin, Cruz was already conquering crowds with her Spanish-language songs. \u201cIf anyone has to get credit for the real crossover, without speaking the language and without singing in English, it was Celia Cruz,\u201d Pardillo Cid said. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. Pardillo Cid gave an example: In 2001, in a corner of Finland close to Russia, Cruz participated in a music festival; she thought no one would go see her. But then, \u201cthere were 5,000 people who didn\u2019t understand her music, who only understood the sounds and possibly the Latin percussion and all this, and she said, \u2018Oh my God! ... I'm almost close to the North Pole and 5,000 souls have come to see me who don\u2019t know me,\u2019\u201d Pardillo Cid recalled her saying. There are still articles on the internet about her visit to the Imatra Big Band festival and a photo of her frozen in mid-dance, smiling. A 2002 Finnish newspaper article referred to her as a \u201cliving legend of Latin music,\u201d the most expensive artist at the festival \u2014 and one of the festival's best moments. Black and Cuban, Celia felt very proud to be Afro Latina, her executor said. Pardillo Cid said Cruz was the first Black Latina to sing in Spanish on American television and perform at Carnegie Hall, where artists such as Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and The Beatles performed.  Pardillo Cid said he still gets letters from fans saying how proud they are that \u201c30 or 40 years ago Celia Cruz already represented us.\u201d At the \"Celia Cruz Forever\" exhibit in Miami's Tower Theater there is a replica of Cruz's dressing room and a video loop of her putting on makeup. Not only does it display what she used on stage, it also shows some objects that she always carried with her: her virgin, a rosary, her birth certificate, a photo of her mother and her champagne glasses. \u201cCelia had that energy that filled a room, that entered you,\u201d Torres, her photo-shoot stylist, said. \u201cCelia was energy.\" At the time of her death, Cruz had more than 100 dresses. One dress, which she had named El Sol, or The Sun, weighed 42 pounds. \u201cA Mexican designer did it, it\u2019s exceptional,\u201d Pardillo Cid said, though after she sang in it for two hours, \u201cshe ended up very tired.\u201d  The Smithsonian American Art Museum has preserved 30% of Cruz\u2019s collection, about 40 dresses, including a silver one that she wore at the Cuba\u2019s famous Tropicana cabaret over 70 years ago. Her executor donated another 22 to the future American Latino Museum, which is still in the planning stages. On the stage Cruz roared to the beat of the bongo, her voice a whirlwind as well as her hips, arms and the ruffles of her dresses that looked like foam. That\u2019s how she performed for decades, with her more than 100 wigs and her electric personality.  When she was in a hurry she turned to a particular wig she called Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora, (an expression for the Virgin Mary as a helper) because \u201cshe always got her out of trouble.\u201d Another orange wig was auctioned in 2022 for $3,000. \u201cPedro [Knight, her husband] and I called her the Iron Woman because she didn\u2019t even get a cold. It was incredible energy. I was in my 20s, very tired and sleepy, and she was alert, made up and ready, that was Celia,\u201d said Pardillo Cid, who started working with her in New York when he was a teenager. In 1996, Celia Cruz and her husband of more than 40 years chose him as their manager, a job he held until the artist\u2019s death. \u201cIt was a constant tour,\u201d said the Cuban American who left his native country when he was a child. \u201cPeople think that this business of ours is a party all the time, and no, it is hard work with planes, countries and it doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d Pardillo Cid said. Being so young amid all the fame could have ended badly, he said, but Cruz kept him safe. \u201cShe stayed in a suite and one of the requirements [was] that the room next door was mine and she told me: \u2018To keep an eye on you, to keep an eye on you,\u2019\u201d he said. Cruz, he said, was very maternal. She always carried a cookie or a sweet in her purse in case Pardillo Cid, who is diabetic, had low blood sugar. \u201cShe always said it in her interviews, that I was like her white son. It was the way she described it. For me it is a great honor,\u201d he said. When she became ill, Pardillo Cid said, she spoke to him about how she wanted him to manage her legacy, which he said was an incredible privilege. Cruz didn't leave the house without her false eyelashes and lipstick, Pardillo Cid said. In the exhibit that honors her is her makeup, her favorite perfume, Shalimar by Guerlain and her collection of fans. \u201cShe always walked with a different fan,\u201d he said. And she always carried her figures of the Virgin Mary, especially that of the Caridad del Cobre, our Lady of Charity, which is Cuba's patron saint. According to Pardillo Cid, she took the figurine from Cuba when she exiled in the 1960s and she promised she wouldn't return to her native country until democracy triumphed. It was an oath that became a reality when she was not allowed to return to Cuba for the funeral of her mother, Catalina Alfonso, by orders of Cuba\u2019s late communist leader Fidel Castro. \u201cJust in case I don\u2019t return, / I\u2019ll take your flag / regretting that my liberated eyes didn\u2019t see you,\u201d Cruz says in her song about Cuba, \u201cJust in case I don\u2019t return.\u201d According to Pardillo Cid, Cruz used to say her suitcases never got lost because the Virgin Mary figures she carried with her protected them. The \"Queen of Salsa\" cooked once or twice a year, in the only month when she was home from touring. She would invite Pardillo Cid and others from her inner circle to accompany her while she prepared white rice, black beans and picadillo, the traditional Cuban dish with ground beef, to which she added french fries. \"She made us come to the house early to see how she chopped the onion, how she did everything. It was quite a process to be able to make that dish, but it turned out excellent,\u201d he said. In private, Celia Cruz changed her high heels for tennis shoes. \u201cShe would buy a pair of tennis shoes in all colors because she liked that model,\" the executor said. She loved to go shopping; she dressed in black with glasses and furry coats to go unnoticed.\" At home, he said, she could spend from breakfast to dinner writing out postcards letters and photos, replying to friends and fans. \"When you say Celia, you say that \u2014 humble. For us or for many, Celia was the light,\u201d Torres said. One day she stopped walking on a red carpet to talk to someone about a soap opera: \u201cAnd they start talking about the soap opera as if they were two neighbors,\u201d Alexis Rodr\u00edguez, the photographer, said.  Celia Cruz never stopped, not even when she got sick. \u201cI think she never expected it \u2014 she hugged Pedro and me crying,\u201d Pardillo Cid said, speaking of when she got her cancer diagnosis. She wanted to die onstage, he said, and she faced her illness, which she never named, \u201cwith incredible courage.\u201d \u201cWe would go to the radiation in the morning at a hospital in New York City and in the afternoon we would return to the studio to record,\u201d he said. A week before she died, she was planning a photo shoot. Last time Rodr\u00edguez and Torres saw her was in Paris. They wanted to photograph her in front of the Eiffel Tower but, to avoid the crowd, they went to a park. \u201cWhen we started there was no one, not a single person. When we finished we had like 40, 50, waiting to talk to her. It was incredible, very nice,\u201d they say.  They knew she was sick, but \u201cshe was such a special person, so unique, that we did everything possible not to think about any of that,\u201d Torres said. \u201cShe remained Celia until the end. She never let the disease change her,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. Exile marked Cruz's life, and it is a recurring theme in her songs: \u201cI thought that at any moment / I was going to return to your soil/but time is passing/and your sun keeps crying,\" she sang. Even if the island becomes a free, democratic country, Cruz's body will not be returning to Cuba, according to Pardillo Cid. \u201cHer body would remain where she is, in New York, in the place where she chose to be eternally,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, next to a park where people are playing dominoes, Rodr\u00edguez gets excited. As a child, he grew up a few blocks from the Tower Theater where his mother would take him to watch matinees. Now, the photo that he took of Celia Cruz on an afternoon almost 30 years ago is on display there. \u201cHere is the exhibition of Celia Forever, in this theater, where I went and was inspired by watching [Federico] Fellini\u2019s films,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cNow I am back there, with our photo at the Tower Theater, and we are in the big screen, in the theater where I was going to watch all those movies, how crazy is that?\u201d That, he said, was Celia\u2019s last gift.

        "title": "Travis Kelce addresses Taylor Swift dating rumors: 'Ball in her court'",
        "content": "Travis Kelce is responding to the rumors that he and Taylor Swift are an item, saying, \u201cI threw the ball in her court.\" The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, 33, compared the romance chatter to a childhood game of telephone during an appearance Thursday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious how much traction this (rumor) has actually got,\u201d Travis Kelce said in a snippet the show posted on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s like an old game in school called telephone, where everybody\u2019s just whispering in each other\u2019s ear, just hearing some random stuff,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cEspecially, no one actually knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d Travis Kelce took the opportunity to take a playful swipe at his fellow NFL star brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, 35, who recently said, albeit perhaps jokingly, that the rumors about his younger brother dating Swift are \u201c100% true.\u201c \u201cEspecially when you\u2019ve got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides,\u201d Travis Kelce said with the hint of a smile. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know. ... The guy is absolutely ridiculous. Can\u2019t stay out of the freaking headlines.\u201d \u201cPlease, everybody, stop asking my brother about my love life,\u201d Travis Kelce added. When host Pat McAfee asked Travis Kelce if he hated the gossip, Kelce said he didn\u2019t. \u201cNo, it\u2019s life, baby. I threw it out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI threw the ball in her court and, you know, I told her, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead and you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead and see which one is a little more lit.\u2019 \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what happens in the near future,\u201d he added. Rumors about a romance between Travis Kelce and Swift began in July, when he expressed interest in the Grammy winner after he attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. On the July 26 episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Travis Kelce revealed that he attempted to meet Swift at the concert so he could give her his phone number. \u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings.

If you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,\u201d Travis Kelce responded. Travis Kelce, who starred in the 2016 E! reality dating series \u201cCatching Kelce,\u201d said he enjoyed Swift\u2019s concert \u2014 even if he felt the singer snubbed him. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal.

        "title": "Sophie Turner sues Joe Jonas for refusing to let their 2 children return to England",
        "content": "Actor Sophie Turner has sued pop star Joe Jonas for the return of their two young children to England, saying in the filing that Jonas will not turn over the children's passports.  The celebrity pair announced their split this month after four years of marriage. The court documents, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for Southern New York, said the couple\u2019s children, born in 2020 and 2022, have been wrongfully kept in New York City since Wednesday from \u201ctheir habitual residence\u201d in England.  The petition says Turner, the \"Game of Thrones\" star, and Jonas, the Jonas Brothers singer, made England their permanent home in April after much discussion because they wanted their children to attend school there. They moved into a rental on a long-term basis in May and entered contracts to buy a home in July, with a plan to move there in December, the filing says. But the couple's relationship was apparently strained by complicated travel arrangements over the summer. They decided that as Turner started filming a new drama series in the U.K. in May, the children would travel with Jonas and a nanny as he kicked off his tour with the Jonas Brothers in the U.S. in late July, according to the petition. The plan, the petition says, was for the children to stay with Jonas and his extended family until Turner finished filming and she would travel to New York in mid-September and return to the U.K. with the kids.  Then came the divorce.  The petition said that the couple had an argument Aug. 15 \u2014 Jonas' birthday \u2014 and that \"on or about Sept. 1\" Jonas filed for divorce in Florida. Turner did not learn about the divorce filing until Sept. 5 through the media, the petition says.  The petition says Jonas\u2019 divorce filings incorrectly claimed the children had lived in Florida for six months before the divorce filing.  Turner and Jonas met Sunday to discuss their separation, and Turner reiterated their agreement for the children to return to England that week, it says.  The petition says Jonas had the children's passports \u2014 but refused to hand them over and send them with Turner back to England. The petition was filed after Jonas allegedly refused to let the children go with their mother, which \" is a breach of the Mother\u2019s rights of custody under English law, England being the children\u2019s habitual residence.\" The petition says the children, who have dual citizenship, are \u201cfully involved and integrated\u201d in daily life in England with the older child attending school and both involved in playdates and cultural activities.  Turner has requested the return of her children to England and has submitted her application for return with the Central Authority for England and Wales, and she says she \u201cnever consented or acquiesced to the removal of the children from England,\u201d the court documents says. The children are with Turner in New York, the filing says. The petition was filed through the child abduction clauses of the Hague Convention \u2014 an international treaty adopted by more than 100 countries, including the U.S. \u2014 which aims to compel the return of children taken by a parent from their countries of \u201chabitual residence.\u201d A representative for Jonas said in a statement provided to NBC News on Thursday that it is Jonas' \"wish\" that Turner \"reconsider her harsh legal position and move forward in a more constructive and private manner.\" \"His only concern is the well-being of his children,\u201d the statement said. The statement also disputed Turner's claim that she was unaware that Jonas was filing for divorce. The statement said that the Florida court where the divorce paperwork was filed \"restricts both parents from relocating the children\" and that Turner was aware of that order. Turner and Jonas had a \u201ccordial\u201d meeting Sunday in New York when she flew there to be with the kids, the representative said. \u201cJoe\u2019s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup,\u201d the statement said.  \u201cLess than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK,\" the statement continued. \"Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children\u2019s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately. If he complies, Joe will be in violation of the Florida Court order.\" The statement said Jonas seeks shared parenting with the kids and \u201cis of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the U.K.\u201d The statement condemned the use of language like \"abduction\" calling it \"misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.\" \"The children were not abducted,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the U.K. and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.\u201d The Hague Convention child abduction clause is mostly enforced against mothers, rather than fathers, making Turner\u2019s petition against Jonas notable. In Hague cases filed in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, mothers made up 73% of the parents who took their children to other countries. Fathers made up fewer than a quarter of the parents who took their children that year, while the remaining 3% were grandparents, other relatives or institutions, the data shows. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that Sophie is trying to relocate the children to England,\" a source close to Jonas said. \"Joe thinks she\u2019s a great mom, but he\u2019s the one who's been taking care of the kids while she\u2019s been working overseas.\u201d The star couple met in 2016. They eloped in Las Vegas in 2019 and had an intimate ceremony a month later at Ch\u00e2teau de Tourreau in the south of France. Turner gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Willa, in July 2020, and their second child was born two years later. Jonas said the marriage was \u201cirretrievably broken\u201d in his divorce filing this month. Turner and Jonas said they \u201cmutually decided to amicably end our marriage\u201d in joint statements on their respective Instagram accounts on Sept. 6. \u201cThere are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children,\u201d they said.

        "content": "The estranged husband of Ruby Franke, the Utah YouTuber arrested for child abuse, refuses to \u201csling mud and point fingers\u201d following accusations that he could have saved his children, says his attorney. Kevin Franke and Ruby Franke are the parents of six children, who were featured on their mom\u2019s former YouTube channel \u201c8 Passengers\u201d since 2015. The account, followed by millions, was controversial for Ruby\u2019s uncompromising punishments. It has since been taken down. The Utah mom shared on her channel that her punishments included denying her children food and personal space, forcing them to do pushups and skip school to clean the floor when they misbehaved. She once withheld Christmas presents from her two youngest children and took away her eldest son\u2019s bed for seven months, actions she freely shared on her own video channel. In August, Ruby Franke was arrested and charged with six counts of of aggravated child abuse. Her business partner Jodi Hildebrandt, a mental health counselor who recorded parenting videos alongside Ruby, was also arrested and charged. Last week, Ruby\u2019s sisters Julie Griffiths Deru and Bonnie Hoellein posted YouTube videos stating they were unaware of their sister\u2019s behavior, because she had cut contact with her family. Hoellein also claimed that Kevin was the responsible party for protecting his family. \u201cIt was Kevin\u2019s job to check in on things and he did not,\u201d she said in her video. Kevin\u2019s attorney Randy Kester tells TODAY.com that Kevin and Ruby have been separated \u201cat Ruby\u2019s directive\u201d for approximately 13 months. \u201cKevin did not want to be separated,\u201d says Kester. \u201cHe wanted to work through concerns as a family. There was never any formal, written decree of separate maintenance or separation agreement. The separation was under terms proscribed by Ruby and Jodi Hildebrandt.\u201d [Kevin] is making an effort to rebuild and bridge these relationships rather than sling mud and point fingers. He is focused on doing what is best for his kids at this point, even if that means undergoing some introspection. -KEVIN FRANKE\u2019S ATTORNEY RANDY KESTER Kester addressed Hoellein\u2019s claims about Kevin. \u201cI think she admits that she, too, was out of the loop and had not had any contact with the children herself ... however, Kevin is more interested in reaching out to his children, family, and friends to heal the past trauma and events.\u201d Kester tells TODAY.com, \u201c(Kevin) is making an effort to rebuild and bridge these relationships rather than sling mud and point fingers. He is focused on doing what is best for his kids at this point, even if that means undergoing some introspection. None of that process, however, is going to be creating more distance between him and his family, including his extended family. He wishes Bonnie and her family well as we all travel down this path of healing.\u201d In previous footage published by \u201c8 Passengers,\u201d Kevin appears to support the decision to send their son, then 14, to the Anasazi Foundation Wilderness Therapy Program, an \u201coutdoor behavioral healthcare program\u201d for youth who struggle with \u201cdefiance\u201d and other behavioral problems. \u201c(What) many of you are criticizing or calling abusive are actually things that mental health professionals have counseled us to,\u201d Kevin said in the video. Last month, the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department announced in a press release that two minor children were found \u201cemaciated and malnourished, with open wounds and duct tape around the extremities.\u201d One child was asking for food and water and was hospitalized in \u201csevere\u201d condition, police said. Police said they found a second child \u201cin a similar physical condition of malnourishment\u201d in another home who was also hospitalized. Four other children were taken in by the Department of Child and Family Services, according to the press release. Ruby was arrested in connection with the children\u2019s treatment, along with her business partner Jodi Hildebrandt, a mental health counselor who recorded parenting videos alongside Ruby for the former YouTube channel ConneXions. Each woman was charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse. Kester recently told Law & Crime, a multimedia network, that the dad was \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d by the child abuse allegations. He said that Kevin had not recently seen his children at all, as Ruby wanted to separate while they worked on their marriage. Kester told the outlet that Ruby assured Kevin that their children were happy in his absence. According to Kester, Kevin \u201cnever had any reason to believe that his children were being abused,\u201d he told the outlet. Kester said in that interview: \u201cIf he had even one inkling that his kids were being abused, and that this separation wasn\u2019t for any other purpose than to figure out a way between he and Ruby to reunite their family, he would have been down there in two seconds.\u201d \u201cPhysical abuse had never been a part of their family,\u201d Kester told Law & Crime.

        "content": "YouTube announced it is rolling out four new artificial intelligence powered tools to simplify the content creation process. The tools were introduced at the Made on YouTube event Thursday and in a blog post. These include AI Insights, which produces new video ideas based on what creators\u2019 audiences are watching; Dream Screen, a generative AI tool that allows YouTube Shorts users to create unique backgrounds by typing in a prompt; assistive search for creator music, which suggests soundtracks for videos; and Aloud, a dubbing tool that translates videos into various languages. \u201cWe want to make it easier for anyone to create on YouTube,\u201d CEO Neal Mohan said during the event.  The tools announced during the Made On YouTube event are expected to be available by early next year.  The news comes as tech companies, including TikTok and Google (which owns YouTube), continue to introduce more AI products amid an interest from consumers and creators to explore the latest technological innovations. In its 2023 Culture & Trends Report, YouTube said its videos about generative AI tools received more than 1.7 billion views this year. And 60% of more than 25,000 viewers surveyed said they were open to watching creators who use AI to generate their content. It was previously announced that YouTube was testing a dubbing feature with creator Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast.  The company also launched YouTube Create, a mobile-first editing app for its Shorts videos. Tools in the app include trimming, automatic captions, voiceover recording and royalty-free music with beat matching technology. It is currently only available for Android phones in the Google Play Story. An iOS version is expected to be rolled out next year.  Mohan said that the company hopes to make content creation more accessible to creators of all levels. He said that YouTube creators have expressed that editing and brainstorming can often be time-consuming. The tools were developed to assist with these tasks.  Many of the tools are geared toward Shorts production. YouTube reported that Shorts engagement is averaging 70 billion views daily.  In June, some creators told NBC News at VidCon that they view AI as a tool rather than a threat.  \u201cI want to learn the most powerful way to use it effectively,\u201d Seth Martino, a creator who makes content on fatherhood and fashion, said at the time.

The decision comes after the 24-year-old was targeted with alleged death threats emblazoned on banners across the city. The news of the cancelation was confirmed by Peso Pluma\u2019s labels, Double P Records and Prajin Music Group, in an Instagram story on Wednesday that stated they had made the decision in order to keep fans and crew safe. \u201cOur goal is to protect the fans and the team. For the safety of everyone involved, we will cancel our show in Tijuana,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThank you so much to all our fans for understanding. We love you. Sincerely: La Doble P.\u201d Peso Pluma\u2019s rise in popularity in the United States has been a rarity for the \"m\u00fasica mexicana\" genre. He recently became the first Mexican artist to perform for the MTV Video Music Awards since their inception in the 1980s and was also the first Mexican act to perform on American late-night television (he appeared on the \u201cTonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d in April). The amplified attention has also come with its own set of obstacles. The banners targeting Peso Pluma were signed with initials that belong to the Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n Cartel, which reportedly prompted local authorities to launch an investigation into the credibility of the threats found in the border city. According to numerous reports, the threatening banners warned the singer not to show up for his Oct. 14 show. \u201cIt will be your last performance because of your disrespectful loose tongue,\u201d the banners read. Local reports also state a man had been arrested in connection to the banners. Peso Pluma, along with numerous \"m\u00fasica mexicana\" singers of present-day and past generations, often touch on narco-related themes in their ballads, from name-dropping powerful drug cartel leaders to making sly drug references. Before this, a string of Peso Pluma\u2019s concerts in the United States were also postponed but no reason was provided by the artist\u2019s team or concert promoters. ",

Lanez, 31, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, was admitted into North Kern State Prison in Delano on Tuesday, according to prison records. A new mug shot was also taken. Lanez maintained a blank expression in the photo. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in August after he was found guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Pete, in the foot after the pair left a party in Los Angeles in 2020. Lanez shot Megan Thee Stallion, a three-time Grammy winner, after a party at Kylie Jenner\u2019s home on July 12, 2020. A jury convicted Lanez, who pleaded not guilty to three felony charges in December, of assault with a semi-automatic firearm, carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. Lanez was transferred days after he lost a bid to be freed on appeal while he seeks to overturn his conviction. \u201cThe denial of the appeal bond is undoubtedly disappointing, but it does not deter us from our mission,\u201d Unite the People, a nonprofit organization representing Lanez in his appeal, said in a statement.

        "content": "Young Latinos who've been pushing back against being shamed for not speaking Spanish are not alone, according to a new survey. Just like \u201cNo Sabo Kids\u201d on TikTok have been poking fun at themselves after being told they should speak better Spanish, a little over half (54%) of Latinos who speak very little or no Spanish have been made to feel bad because of it, according to a Pew Research Center report published Wednesday. What's more, 40% of all Latino adults say they \"often\" or \"extremely often\" hear other Hispanics make jokes about Latinos who don't speak Spanish or don't speak it well. The report, however, points to \"an interesting tension I think is striking,\" co-author Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew's director of race and ethnicity research, told NBC News. While a large majority of Latinos (85%) say it's at least somewhat important for future generations of Hispanics to speak Spanish, nearly 80% say it's not necessary to speak Spanish in order to be considered Hispanic. The widely shared view that Spanish is not synonymous with Latino identity could be reflecting changing demographics, Lopez said, as the number of third-generation Latinos (those who were born in the U.S. from two U.S.-born parents) grows and as almost 40% of U.S.-born Latinos marry non-Latinos. The survey focused on U.S. Latinos' views on Spanish, which is the country's most commonly spoken non-English language. Almost 40 million Latinos speak Spanish at home, according to Pew. However, many Brazilians, who speak Portuguese, consider themselves Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are hundreds of Indigenous languages in Latin America.

        "content": "A chaotic and hilarious TikTok video of Texas sisters banding together to fix a spontaneous haircut before their mother finds out is going viral for its spot-on representation of sisterhood. Now the mom is speaking out \u2014 and tells TODAY.com what really happened after the home haircut. The video has more than 2 million views, and starts with 15-year-old Valentina filming a selfie video in her Mission, Texas home, when she is interrupted by her 9-year-old sister Khaleesi. \u201cI need the scissors,\u201d Khaleesi says abruptly. When Valentina asks why, she responds, \u201cSomething. Just something.\u201d \u201cBe careful,\u201d says Valentina, handing her scissors and returning to her skincare routine. Suddenly, there is a blood-curdling scream and their sister Camelia, 8, rushes over with freshly-chopped bangs. \u201cKhaleesi cut my hair!\u201d yells Camelia. \u201cTomorrow is picture day!\u201d \u201cYou wanted it, bro!\u201d Khaleesi yells back. Mom Gresia Zamarripa, who was bathing her 2-year-old daughter Gabriella, is heard asking what happened. \u201cNothing! I\u2019m trying to find a new hairstyle for (Camelia),\u201d says Valentina, urging her little sisters to close the door and hide the evidence. \u201cWhy are you laughing? I told you not to do anything stupid!\u201d says Valentina, fussing with her sister\u2019s bangs. \u201cIf mom finds out, she\u2019s going to kill both of you.\u201d As Valentina searches \u201cHow to cut bangs\u201d on TikTok, 2-year-old sister Magdalena wanders in. \u201cOooh! You\u2019re in trouble!\u201d says Magdalena, triggering a group argument. \u201cDon\u2019t tell mom .... be quiet. I\u2019ll give you a cookie!\u201d Valentina begs Magdalena to silence her.

Then Zamarripa walks in. Valentina immediately tried concealing Camelia, but her mother knew. \u201cShe\u2019s not turning around for a reason,\u201d says Zamarripa, beginning a countdown. Camelia turned to face her mom, as accusations flew between the sisters about who was responsible for her new bangs. \u201cGo show your dad,\u201d Zamarripa tells her daughters, as Valentina says to the camera, \u201cPray for them.\u201d The viral video ends there, and left viewers wanting more. TikTok followers called the video \u201ca documentary about sisterhood\u201d and said, \u201cThis was a coming of age movie.\u201d \u201cLittle women (Latina\u2019s version),\u201d \u201cThis is THE sisters experience\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing scarier than when moms start counting down,\u201d wrote other followers. Zamarripa tells TODAY.com that Camelia asked Khaleesi to give her bangs to emulate a character from the TV show \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty.\u201d It was the third time that Camelia attempted a haircut without permission. \u201cIn May, she ruined her hair when she curled it with a comb (which got stuck) so she cut it off,\u201d says Zamarripa. \u201cAnd when Camelia was 3, Khaleesi cut her hair down to the scalp. They said, \u2018We played barber shop.\u2019\u201d Zamarripa decided against a punishment after talking to her daughters (although she did hide all the scissors in the house, including a blunt-tip pair in Magdalena\u2019s pencil case). She agrees that Camelia\u2019s bangs look cute. Picture day was a success. \u201cMy bangs are on point,\u201d Camelia says in a follow-up Facebook video.

In the track\u2019s music video, she sets fire to a tree and walks away as the ash rains down on a toy version of a small town. \u201cAfter the Trump years, people\u2019s biases were on full display,\u201d Morris told the L.A. Times. \u201cThey were proud to be misogynistic and racist and homophobic and transphobic. All these things were being celebrated, and it was weirdly dovetailing with this hyper-masculine branch of country music.\u201d Morris has been embroiled in several of the country music \u201cculture wars\u201d she described. Last year, she was dubbed a \u201clunatic country music person\u201d by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson when she criticized anti-transgender remarks made by the wife of country music singer Jason Aldean. Morris printed the nickname on t-shirts to raise more than $100,000 for transgender youths in response.  The small town depicted in the music video for \u201cThe Tree\u201d may be a reference to Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cTry That in a Small Town,\u201d which was No. 1 on the Billboard hot song chart. Morris said the song is streamed out of spite by those hoping to \u201cown the libs.\u201d  According to The Economist, 36 per cent of Spotify\u2019s top 50 songs in America were country songs in 2023, a sharp increase from 2 percent in 2016. \"Try That in a Small Town\" was streamed on the service more than 30 million times. Aldean's viral hit met online criticism for what some view as its endorsement of racism and violence. Its music video caused an uproar for featuring a Tennessee courthouse where a teenager was lynched in the 1920s. Several Republican politicians \u2014 including presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum \u2014 responded with public support of Aldean. At a concert, Aldean told fans that his song\u2019s message is really about community. Morris considered skipping the 2022 Country Music Association awards because of the controversy with the Aldeans. This isn\u2019t the first time Morris has been critical of country music\u2019s relationship with political issues. In January, she apologized for the country music industry\u2019s contentious relationship with the LGBTQ+ community on an episode of \"Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race.\" In 2021, she spoke out when country singer Morgan Wallen was caught drunkenly using a racial slur. Wallen's 2023 album \"One Thing at a Time\" held the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart for 15 weeks. \u201cIf you truly love this type of music and you start to see problems arise, it needs to be criticized,\u201d Morris said in the L.A. Times interview. \u201cAnything this popular should be scrutinized if we want to see progress.\" Morris' claims about the weaponization of country music echo similar comments made by country music chart topper Oliver Anthony, whose song \"Rich Men North of Richmond\" has become an anthem on the political right. Several Republican politicians heralded the song and it was even a topic of discussion at the GOP presidential debate. Anthony called the dialogue \"aggravating\" and said he regrets that his song had been \"weaponized.\" Several country music stars have reacted to Morris' departure with support, including Lindsey Ell, Sam Hunt and Grammy award-winner Carly Pearce. Pearce told Entertainment Tonight Canada that Morris has to \"follow her truth\" and believes she will find what she is searching for. Now, Morris is working on her next LP with pop producer Jack Antonoff, who has a history of helping country musicians rebrand. In 2020, Antonoff produced The Chicks\u2019 album \u201cGaslighter,\u201d the band\u2019s first album since removing \u201cDixie\u201d from their name due to negative connotations with slavery.  Morris told the LA Times that she intends to spend less time thinking about whether her songs will market well in the country music universe and focus on simply making good music.

        "title": "From migrant farmworker to astronaut: an incredible true story is now a movie",
        "content": "There were five key \u201cingredients\u201d that Jos\u00e9 M. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s father shared with him to achieve a \"recipe\" for success. Hern\u00e1ndez would become one of NASA's few Latino NASA astronauts, and his inspiring story is now the subject of Prime Video\u2019s \u201cA Million Miles Away,\u201d with actor Michael Pe\u00f1a starring as the engineer and former astronaut. Audiences are likely to be inspired by Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s unwavering drive and determination to achieve his dream \u2014 despite applying and being rejected to the space program 11 times before finally being accepted. From a young age, Hern\u00e1ndez, along with his siblings would help his migrant farm working parents, Salvador and Julia Hern\u00e1ndez, pick produce in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley in California. While oftentimes missing school and relocating for periods of time, Hern\u00e1ndez was fascinated with the stars and space and had one big dream in mind: to become an astronaut. \u201cJos\u00e9\u2019s story was such an amazing, such a beautiful, honest, inescapable story that I just had to do,\u201d director Alejandra M\u00e1rquez Abella tells TODAY.com. \u201cI did have the experience of parallelizing myself to his story. If he could achieve all this then I can.\u201d It also resonated with Pe\u00f1a. \"My mom grew up not too far from where we shot in Mexico,\u201d the actor said in the production notes about Hern\u00e1ndez's story. \u201cNeither of my parents had a lot of opportunities. Each of them worked two full-time jobs so we could go to good private schools, which turned my attitude around as to what was possible. Becoming an actor is not the same as being an astronaut, but it is a nearly insane dream for anyone.\u201d Read on to learn more about his decades-long journey from the fields to more than 200 miles above the Earth in the International Space Station. Yes, the film is based on Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s autobiography, \u201cReaching for the Stars: The Inspiring Story of a Migrant Farmworker Turned Astronaut,\u201d released in 2012. After previously turning down offers to bring his story to life, Hern\u00e1ndez was impressed with the producers, writers (Bettina Gilois, Hern\u00e1n Jim\u00e9nez and M\u00e1rquez Abella) and director\u2019s vision. \u201cI had written a couple of books and was giving motivational talks,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in the film\u2019s production notes. \u201cMy purpose is to encourage kids of any culture or race to reach their maximum potential. I saw the slate of movies this team has produced and knew these guys were serious filmmakers who could help bring my message to a wider audience.\u201d For M\u00e1rquez Abella, it was important for her and Hern\u00e1ndez to have a close relationship, which they cultivated over time. \u201cBeing Mexicans, both of us, it was easy to (form) a very familiar relationship from the beginning. I went to his house, I visited his family, his kids, his wife, his parents,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a very nice thing to have, not only because I wanted to observe and explore his life and his character, but also because I did want to have someone who could check on every technicality that the film needed. He was always around and it was a very nice experience.\u201d Born in French Camp, California, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s parents were originally from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. As depicted in the film, and confirmed by M\u00e1rquez Abella, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s family followed the seasonal harvests. As a child, he worked in the fields with his parents. Hern\u00e1ndez only spoke Spanish until he was 12 years old and sporadically attended school. The film shows his second grade teacher Miss Young (Michelle Krusiec) visiting his home and talking to his parents about the importance of settling in one place so their kids could have a good education. \u201cThat was a true story. She went to his house when he was a kid and she convinced the parents to stay in Stockton and stop moving around California and Mexico,\u201d M\u00e1rquez Abella tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd that was a very (big) moment in Jos\u00e9\u2019s life that changed everything.\u201d \u201cOf course, we have to add some sparks here and there so that the story rounds up the way that we wanted,\" she said. \"But yeah, the story is true.\u201d M\u00e1rquez Abella notes that Miss Young visiting Hern\u00e1ndez right before he headed to space was \u201cadded sparkle.\u201d Once the family settled down and planted their roots, Hern\u00e1ndez graduated from Franklin High School in Stockton and used his father\u2019s \u201croad map\u201d to make his dream come true. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s father, Salvador Hern\u00e1ndez, gives his young son sage advice when he\u2019s frustrated from picking produce in the fields. He would go on to share with him the \u201crecipe\u201d to success, which is also how the film is formatted into various chapters of the engineer\u2019s life. \u201cFind your goal\u201d \u201cKnow how far you are\u201d \u201cDraw a roadmap\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how, learn\u201d \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve made it, you probably have to work harder\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the recipe that Jos\u00e9\u2019s father gave him in the fields when he was a kid and that was something that actually happened,\u201d M\u00e1rquez Abella reveals. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t in the script, but when I was editing the film, I thought that the film had the same structure as the recipe. It follows those principles, so it focused on those different stages of succeeding in Jos\u00e9\u2019s life,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I decided that we should chapter it in those ingredients,\u201d she continues, adding that it \u201cmade sense\u201d and \u201cit takes the audience in a much clearer way through the dream.\u201d In 1984, Hern\u00e1ndez earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the University of the Pacific. Two years later, he earned a master\u2019s degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. After getting his master\u2019s he worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California. He was one of few Latinos there. The film depicts him getting mistaken for the janitor. Once there, per the production notes, he and a colleague co-developed the first full-field digital mammogram. In the film, Rosa Salazar portrays Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s wife Adela Hern\u00e1ndez. While dating, she asks him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your big goal? Dream?\u201d \u201cI want to be an astronaut,\u201d he replies, while Adela Hern\u00e1ndez bursts out in laughter. When he doesn\u2019t laugh, she says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re serious. OK.\u201d She would go on to be pivotal in making her husband\u2019s dream come true, supporting him after every rejection and pushing him to better himself. They share five children: Julio, Karina, Vanessa, Marisol and Antonio. As the film showed, she eventually owned a restaurant just outside the Johnson Space Center gates called Tierra Luna Grill. Despite being rejected year after year, Hern\u00e1ndez applied 12 times to NASA\u2019s training program before being accepted in 2004 at the age of 42. The film shows him keeping every rejection letter, but the director doesn\u2019t actually believe he kept them. To bulk up his application, he became a certified scuba diver, obtained his pilot\u2019s license and learned to speak Russian. Finally on August 29, 2009, Hern\u00e1ndez would finally get to go to space. He traveled 14 days as a crew member on the shuttle Discovery, which transported seven tons of equipment and supplies to the International Space Station. Per the film, \u201cHe had tacos and listened to Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s \u2018El Hijo del Pueblo\u2019 up there.\u201d His trip made him the first former migrant farmworker to have traveled to space. Hern\u00e1ndez lives in Stockton, California, running the aerospace consulting firm he co-founded, Tierra Luna. As the film notes at the end, he still picks grapes with his father \u2014 only this time on their vineyard, where they make and sell their own line of wines, Tierra Luna Cellars. He\u2019s also a motivational speaker, making guest appearances at various events. Currently, per the film, he and his wife are building a home where they plan living when they retire. What does Jos\u00e9 M. Hern\u00e1ndez have to say about \u2018A Million Miles Away\u2019? In an exclusive statement to TODAY.com, Hern\u00e1ndez says he hopes the film inspires people to \u201cpursue their own dreams\u201d like he did his. \u201cI consider it an honor to have my life story told in the form of a film and by an exceptional director like Alejandra,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope the film serves as a way of motivating many people to pursue their own dreams with the kind of passion I had to pursue mine.\u201d As for M\u00e1rquez Abella, she wants people to know that they can do whatever they set their mind to, as well as highlight \u201cthe people who take the time to pick the food and bring it to the tables.\u201d \u201cWe have to be thankful for all of those (jobs) that no one wants to do, but (are) most necessary and important,\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, the important thing is to say that those jobs are honorable and they give you your work ethic and they give you your morals. It\u2019s from there that you\u2019re gonna build whatever you want to do. You don\u2019t have to become someone else, you don\u2019t have to be someone else or there\u2019s not another more honorable thing to do. You just have to look inside, and then look outside.\u201d \u201cA Million Miles Away\u201d is streaming on Prime Video. An earlier version of this story was first published on TODAY.com. ",

        "title": "An Afro Latino comic book fan is living the dream as author of a new 'Avengers' book",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Imagine being a lifelong, self-described huge fan of superheroes and comic books and then getting a chance to write a book about them. For Afro Latino writer and journalist David Betancourt, it was a dream come true \u2014 and it all started on a Zoom call. Betancourt, a Washington Post reporter focused on comic book culture, was on a call three years ago speaking with several authors for a story he was writing, about a new \"Star Wars\" publishing initiative. Also on the call was Lucasfilm creative director Michael Siglain. \u201cI think he realized that I wasn\u2019t just a writer covering \"Star Wars,\" but that I was somebody who was into it, who spoke the language. After the story came out, he reached out to me and said that he had spoken to some people who were looking for someone to write an \"Avengers\" novel, and that I might be a good candidate for them,\" Betancourt told NBC News. \u201cIt floored me because I had never written a book before,\" Betancourt said. \"I had written a comic book, but writing a 22-page comic book and a 300-page book are completely different worlds. I remember being very excited but also thinking, 'Can I do it?' So I took it as a challenge; there was no way I was going to say no.\" Betancourt is the author of the new Marvel book \"The Avengers Assembled: The Origin Story of Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes,\" which takes a deep dive into the biographies and histories of \u201cthe greatest superhero team of all time,\u201d including fan favorites such as Vision and Black Widow. The book was published by DK Publishing. One of the hardest things to figure out, Betancourt said, was what exactly to include in the book. \u201cThere\u2019s 60 years of comics materials, not even counting the movies. We had to think what era we were going to be focusing on because the (Avengers) team is constantly evolving,\" he said. \"Marvel said it wanted an origin story and I said, then it has to be the original team and that was the original one that came out in 1963. That word \u2018origin\u2019 helped me narrow down what to focus on, so we took it back to the very beginning.\u201d Critics have often maligned comic books as not serious. Betancourt sees it very differently. \u201cI never got in trouble because I had a comic book in my hand,\" he said. \"I\u2019m of a generation that will never be sick of it \u2014 there are some people who can\u2019t let it go or don\u2019t want to let it go, and I\u2019m in that category.\u201d Betancourt, who is of Puerto Rican and Black heritage, comes from a family of comic book readers; his father was the one who turned him on to them. Betancourt said his new book has been a little \"surreal\" for his dad because he grew up as a Marvel fan and he still reads comic books. \"He forged my love of comics, and having a parent who loves comics as much as he does was such a help growing up,\" he said. Convincing his mother was another story. \u201cI come from an era where some parents didn\u2019t want their kids reading comics; they wanted them to read \u2018real\u2019 books. She would get mad when I would come home with comic books and would tell my dad and uncles to stop giving them to me. Clearly I\u2019ve made a believer out of her,\u201d Betancourt said. Betancourt takes very seriously his role as one of just a few Afro Latino writers in the entertainment business, particularly since he saw very few of them growing up.   \u201cI saw myself for the first time in any form of entertainment when Miles Morales came along (as Spider-Man in 2011). To have a character who was 100% who I am \u2014 one Puerto Rican parent, one African American parent \u2014 floored me ... I still feel the impact of that. It\u2019s not something I take for granted,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cAfrican Americans in this country have done an incredible job of making a name for themselves in so many facets of life, especially in entertainment, but when I go over to the Latin American side, in terms of what Latin American entertainment is, very rarely do I see one like myself,\" Betancourt said. \"My Puerto Rican family is not Black, but they\u2019re not white either, and you rarely see that represented, whether in news, entertainment, movies. So I take very seriously the fact that there\u2019s a character that 100% encompasses who I am in terms of my original identity. It\u2019s something that I never thought would happen.\" \"I\u2019m living proof that editorial decisions like that have an impact,\" Betancourt said, referring to the creation of Miles Morales and the recent Blue Beetle movie, with its Latino lead. \"I am 100% someone who was impacted when Marvel decided that they needed to make superheroes reflect a little bit more the diversity of this country and the world,\" he said. Betancourt considers it part of his life\u2019s work to help diversify the world of comic books and superheroes. \u201cI take it as a responsibility now that I\u2019m writing, that I do want to inspire kids, whether you\u2019re Latino or African American, Afro Latino, biracial, I want you to be able to see yourself in me and see yourself in the world that I\u2019m building,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very important, in terms of representation in these fantasy worlds. It\u2019s something I hope to continue to be part of in the future.\u201d \u201cAny type of reading, especially for young kids, is good reading. If you\u2019re a parent and your kid is interested in superheroes and wants to read about those characters, let them read,\" Betancourt said. The worst that would happen is they\u2019re going to become great readers and become very creative and that can be something they turn into later in life. I was very grateful to my dad because reading comics was something we could do together.\" \"I wanted to write for Marvel, but I never thought I could it in this capacity,\" he said. \"I\u2019m very grateful that something I care about very deeply has merged with my career; it\u2019s very special.\u201d For those who want to follow a similar path, Betancourt has some pointers. \u201cI would say to young kids who want to do this \u2014 the master class in how to do it is at your comic book store. Get one and figure out what kind of story you like and create your own story. You never know, someone might ask you to do that. You won\u2019t know unless you try,\" he said. \"When I was young I would make up my own stories; I never thought it would take me anywhere,\" Betancourt said. \"I did it because it was fun. There is a way, if you believe in yourself enough and dive into the culture.\u201d Patricia Guadalupe is a freelance journalist based in Washington, D.C.

        "title": "Russell Brand postpones comedy tour following sexual assault allegations",
        "content": "Russell Brand has postponed his remaining U.K. comedy shows following the publication of multiple sexual abuse allegations against him over the weekend. Brand was accused of sexual and emotional abuse by four women in a joint investigation by the Times of London, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches. The comedian turned wellness influencer denied the allegations, saying that all of his relationships have been consensual. The Theatre Royale Windsor management announced that it would be suspending the end of Brand's current \"Bipolarisation\" comedy tour in a statement Monday. \"We are postponing these few remaining addiction charity fundraiser shows, we don\u2019t like doing it \u2014 but we know you\u2019ll understand,\" the statement said. It's unclear whether the dates will be rescheduled. Theatre Royal Windsor said it will be issuing refunds in line with the venue's policies. The Times of London, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches spoke to four women, one of whom said she had a three month relationship with Brand when she was 16 years old. That woman, who identified as Alice, said Brand was 31 at the time and alleged that he forced her to perform oral sex. Brand did not stop until she punched him in the stomach, she told The Times. She also alleged that although she was of legal consenting age in the U.K., Brand guided her on how to present their relationship to her family and to save his contact under a different name. She also told The Times she reached out to Brand's literary agency in 2020 with her allegations. Management agency Tavistock Wood said Sunday that they dropped Brand as a client, adding that they were \"horribly misled\" by him. Another woman, who was identified by the name Nadia, accused Brand of raping her at his Los Angeles residence in 2012. She said Brand invited her to the home after they'd had consensual sex once before, but on this occasion wanted a \"friend\" to join them, according to The Times. When she refused, Brand held her against a wall and raped her, Nadia alleged. NBC News has not independently confirmed any of the allegations against Brand. Metropolitan Police Service told NBC News that it received a report of sexual assault against Brand on Sunday, a day after the investigation's publication and a documentary that also aired Saturday. The alleged sexual assault occurred in 2003, in London's Soho neighborhood, according to the police department. \"We continue to encourage anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a sexual offence, no matter how long ago it was, to contact us,\" Metropolitan Police Service said. Bluebird, a division of Pan McMillian, also said Monday that it was suspending its pending publications with Brand. \u201cThese are very serious allegations and in the light of them, Bluebird has taken the decision to pause all future publishing with Russell Brand,\" the company said. Brand has denied all of the allegations against him in a social media post. \u201cBut amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,\u201d Brand said in a video. Channel 4 confirmed that episodes of \"Big Brother\u2019s Big Mouth\" and \"The Great British Bake Off\" which featured Brand have been removed from its streaming service. Brand worked with the network from 2004 and 2007, when some of the allegations occurred. One staff member, a woman identified as Rachel, alleged to the Times that Brand flashed his penis at her in his dressing room and insinuated that she could perform oral sex on him. Other crew members also alleged mistreatment from Brand in interviews with the times, including people who felt that they were working as a \"pimp\" for Brand as he pursued members of the audience for sex. \"We have asked the production company who produced the programmes for Channel 4 to investigate these allegations and report their findings properly and satisfactorily to us,\" the network said. \"Channel 4 is also conducting its own internal investigation, and we would encourage anyone who is aware of such behaviour to contact us directly.\" Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "'John Leguizamo Live at Rikers' brings comedy, inspiration to 'invisible' young inmates",
        "content": "Accompanied by a hulking guard, actor John Leguizamo enters a large, empty auditorium and appears taken aback. \u201cOh, wow, this is like Radio City Music Hall,\u201d he says. He surveys the venue. \u201cIf I can do this, I can do anything.\u201d This is no typical performance for the acclaimed star of theater, television and film. It's one of the opening scenes from the short documentary \u201cJohn Leguizamo Live at Rikers,\u201d now on streaming and on demand for the first time after a weeklong Academy Award-qualifying theatrical run. The award-winning short documentary made its debut Friday, part of the Black Experience collection on Xfinity Channel on Xfinity X1, Flex, Xfinity Stream and Xumo apps. (Xfinity and NBC News are part of Comcast and Comcast NBCUniversal). In it, Leguizamo performs his one-man Broadway show for an audience of more than 400 inmates, and then leads discussions with young men enrolled in an anti-recidivism initiative. Rikers Island, a New York City correctional facility, may seem like an unlikely setting for Leguizamo to perform his show, \u201cGhetto Klown.\u201d Yet many of the show\u2019s themes \u2014 from family instability to police profiling to life on the streets \u2014 clearly resonate with his audience. Onstage, Leguizamo recalls that he was \u201cmad rebellious\u201d as a young man, and that he had run-ins with the police. \u201cI got arrested,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI guess you could say it was my first bad review.\u201d Rikers Island has an inmate population that is predominantly Black and Latino. In recent years, the complex has become infamous for abuse, corruption and mismanagement, with calls from some politicians to shut it down or place it under federal control.   In this harsh environment, \u201cJohn Leguizamo Live at Rikers\u201d weaves together scenes from his performance and group discussions with the inmates. One young man realizes that he and Leguizamo grew up in the same housing project in the Queens borough, while another reveals that he is a father. \u201cI gotta change,\u201d he says softly. The inmates voice their dreams and aspirations for life after Rikers: to become a firefighter, to be a psychologist, to help people. These young men are participants in the Harlem-based Getting Out and Staying Out (GOSO) program, which helps inmates further their education, secure employment and achieve emotional well-being. According to the film, a majority of men involved in the criminal justice system are reincarcerated within three years of their release. But 86% of participants in the GOSO program do not return to the prison system. \u201cWhen I first started acting, I didn\u2019t just want to be an entertainer, I wanted to be an artist,\u201d Leguizamo said in a statement prepared before the current SAG/AFTRA and Writers Guild strikes. \u201cAfter my performance at Rikers, I realized that there are few individuals more invisible than those who have been through America\u2019s criminal justice system. After performing and talking with these young men, it\u2019s clear how much work still needs to be done to help lift them up.\u201d \u201cJohn Leguizamo Live at Rikers\u201d had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York last year. It has since been screened at 30 film festivals throughout the world, including Cannes, and received five awards for best short documentary. For director and producer Elena Engel of Azimuth Films, \u201cJohn Leguizamo Live at Rikers\u201d was a deeply personal experience, inspired by an immediate family member who was sentenced to prison for a nonviolent offense. \u201cIt basically changed the trajectory of his life and forced me to recognize the lack of human consideration and dignity in the American justice system,\u201d she said.  Engel is an award-winning filmmaker who has worked with Disney, Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. She hopes that her film will offer a more hopeful, empathetic perspective on behalf of all young people involved in the criminal justice system. \u201cJohn and I shared a common desire to support the efforts of GOSO participants who basically face a world in which they\u2019re demonized, even after fulfilling their debt to society.\u201d Amid the confines of Rikers, Engel is proud that she was able to be part of what Leguizamo refers to in the film as \u201ca soul exchange.\u201d \u201cThe guards enjoyed themselves, everyone behaved themselves, and there was a lot of laughter in the audience,\u201d she said, recalling moments of joy, pathos and even sweetness at Rikers. On the last day of shooting, two inmates presented her with a \u201cvase\u201d of flowers \u2014 a cutoff Coke can, filled with flowers from a small prison garden plot.  \u201cI just hope that the personal truths that are voiced by the participants in this film will inspire audiences to look into the emotional and social costs of incarceration and recidivism,\u201d Engel added. Leguizamo is a longtime advocate of Latino representation in the entertainment industry. \u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re all absent all over the media spectrum,\u201d he told Variety earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s the huge problem ... So that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019re trying to change that and get the content to the people who want it.\u201d, Leguizamo is the co-founder of NGLmit\u00fa, a digital media and entertainment company focused on creating content for bilingual and bicultural English-speaking Latinos. On Friday, Comcast announced the introduction and distribution of the mit\u00faTV streaming app across its entertainment platforms, including Xfinity X1, Xfinity Flex and soon on Xumo TV. This includes original programming, such as the comedy talk show \"Three Gs In A Pod\" and the talk show \"Girl, Let Me Tell You.\" Raul A.

        "title": "Jann Wenner removed from Rock & Roll Hall of Fame board after interview",
        "content": "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation removed Rolling Stone magazine co-founder Jann Wenner from its board of directors, the organization said Saturday. The Rock & Roll Hall referred reporters to a publicity firm that confirmed in an emailed statement Wenner's removal from the board of the organization he helped found in 1983. The news comes one day after The New York Times published an interview with Wenner regarding his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Masters,\u201d which contains interviews with musicians \u2014 all white men \u2014 including Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen and Bono. Wenner was asked why the book did not include interviews with women or people of color. \"Just none of them were as articulate enough on this intellectual level,\" Wenner is quoted as saying about the women of rock. In the interview he expressed similar thoughts regarding Black rock artists, some of whom created the music and culture Wenner reflected upon and profited from with Rolling Stone. \u201cOf Black artists \u2014 you know, Stevie Wonder, genius, right?\u201d Wenner said, according to the interview. \u201cI suppose when you use a word as broad as \u2018masters,\u2019 the fault is using that word. Maybe Marvin Gaye, or Curtis Mayfield? I mean, they just didn\u2019t articulate at that level.\u201d Wenner said in the interview that his selection of musicians for the book was \u201cintuitive\u201d and \u201cwhat I was interested in,\u201d and acknowledged that there might be criticism of his choice. \u201cYou know, just for public relations sake, maybe I should have gone and found one Black and one woman artist to include here that didn\u2019t measure up to that same historical standard, just to avert this kind of criticism,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWhich, I get it. I had a chance to do that.\u201d On Saturday night, Wenner released a statement apologizing for his comments. \"In my interview with The New York Times I made comments that diminished the contributions, genius, and impact of Black and women artists and I apologize wholeheartedly for those remarks,\" he said. The author said the forthcoming book, was \"not meant to represent the whole of music and it\u2019s diverse and important originators but to reflect the high points of my career and interviews I felt illustrated the breadth and experience in that career.\" Wenner said he has an admiration for \u201cworld-changing artists\u201d not represented in the book whom he \u201cwill celebrate and promote as long as I live.\u201d His publisher, Little, Brown and Company, did not respond to a request seeking comment Saturday night. Wenner's remarks in The New York Times interview have been widely criticized. Evelyn McDonnell, a Loyola Marymount University journalism professor and expert on music, gender and politics, said on Facebook that Wenner expressed sexism and racism for decades that underly many \u201cfalse \u2018master\u2019 narratives about music history.\u201d She said such exclusion inspired her to curate and edit the book \u201cRock She Wrote\u201d in 1995 with NPR pop critic Ann Powers, report on the Hall of Fame's gender inequity and edit the book \u201cWomen Who Rock.\u201d Author Dawnie Walton called Wenner's quoted words \"enraging, disgusting, offensive.\" Craig Seymour, who identifies himself as a \u201cBlack Gay Music Critic,\u201d said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the popular music industry includes \"an oppressive system of value that Rolling Stone helped create and perpetuate.\" Rolling Stone was well-known for initially snubbing waves of music, from hip-hop to electronic dance music, that may have existed outside its vision of rock 'n' roll culture \u2014 a vision usually dominated by white, baby boomer-created music with poetic aspiration and anti-establishment undertones. Wenner founded Rolling Stone with journalist Ralph J. Gleason in San Francisco in 1967. Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.  ",

        "title": "Russell Brand denies sexual assault allegations",
        "content": "British comedian and actor Russell Brand is denying four women's allegations of sexual assault against him following a joint investigation published Saturday by the Times of London, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches. In a video posted to his social media accounts, Brand denied the allegations and said his relationships have all been consensual. He said he received \"extremely disturbing\" communications from a mainstream TV company and a newspaper \"listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks.\" \"But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,\" Brand said. An attorney for Brand declined to comment on the allegations. Channel 4, The Times and The Sunday Times are airing a special on Saturday entitled \u201cRussel Brand: In Plain Sight,\" in which four women accuse him of rape or sexual assault; a fifth accuses him of flashing his genitals at her. One of the women alleges she had a three-month relationship with Brand when she was 16, according to The Times. Although that is the age of consent in the United Kingdom, she claims Brand groomed and raped her. \u201cRussell engaged in the behaviours of a groomer, looking back, but I didn\u2019t even know what that was then, or what that looked like,\u201d the woman, who is not being identified, told The Times. NBC has not independently confirmed any of the allegations against Brand. In his denial, Brand went on to say that the allegations stem from a time during the height of his mainstream fame when he was transparently \u201cvery, very promiscuous,\u201d adding that all the relationships he had at the time \u201cwere absolutely always consensual.\u201d \u201cAnd to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that I absolutely deny, makes me question \u2018Is there another agenda at play?\u2019\u201d Brand expressed that he feels his expansion in recent years in the anti-mainstream space, including the growth of his \"Stay Free with Russell Brand\" podcast where he explores \"the ulterior truth behind our constructed reality,\" may be a reason behind these recently surfaced allegations. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear to me, or at least it feels to me, like there\u2019s a serious and concerted agenda to control these kinds of spaces and these kind of voices, and I mean my voice along with your voice,\" he told his audience. The comedian also accused The Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 of working closely together to construct \u201ca coordinated attack\u201d against him. He also mentioned that there are witnesses \"whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct.\" Brand does not elaborate or identify who these witnesses are in his video. The Sunday Times asked Brand's lawyer for the evidence he referred to but no answer was provided. \"We are obviously going to look into this matter, because it's very, very serious,\" Brand said. \"In the meantime, I want you to stay close, stay awake, but more important than any of that, if you can, please, stay free.\" Brand currently resides in the U.K., according to his attorney. NBC News reached out to The Times. The publication did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CLARIFICATION (Sept. 19, 2023 12:30 pm ET): This article has been updated to clarify the allegations against Brand. Four women have accused him of rape or sexual assault; a fifth accused him of flashing his genitals at her.

        "title": "The 'no sabo kids' are pushing back on Spanish-language shaming",
        "content": "Sara Lopez, 24, didn\u2019t learn Spanish from her parents because they didn\u2019t want her to go through the discrimination they faced for speaking the language back in the 1980s.  \u201cTheir teachers were mostly white and would punish my parents or other students for speaking Spanish,\u201d Lopez, a Los Angeles resident, said. For a while, Lopez felt embarrassed for not being able to understand or communicate in Spanish and was frequently teased and bullied for not \u201cspeaking Spanish right.\u201d Eventually, she said, her parents healed from their childhood experiences and started to encourage her to learn more Spanish. Lopez now takes pride in being a \u201cno sabo kid\" \u2014 and wants people to understand there are many others who've had a similar experience.  In recent years, the phrase \"no sabo,\" which is the incorrect way of saying \"I don't know\" in Spanish (the correct translation is \"no s\u00e9\") has become synonymous with young Latinos who aren\u2019t fluent in Spanish. But what used to be a put-down term has now become a cultural hit online and a widespread meme: TikTok alone has more than 644 million video views with the hashtag #nosabo and #nosabokid is close to 400 million. On social media, teens and young adults will poke fun at no sabo experiences. In one TikTok video, a \"no sabo\" teen asks her sibling if she's seen the \"crayola\" their mom is looking for, meaning carriola, or stroller. Another video shows a no sabo \"olympics\" where teens are quizzed on the correct Spanish word. While most of the videos are playful and even hilarious, the growing trend of Latinos \u201cclapping back\u201d at the policing of Spanish has opened up an age-old debate on what it means to be Hispanic or Latino in the U.S. Dr. David Hayes Bautista, professor and director at the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture, said he likes to remind people that being \u201cLatino is separable from Spanish,\u201d and that being Latino isn\u2019t a monolith \u2014 some may speak Spanish, some may speak Indigenous dialects and some may only know English. \u201cThere are about 63 million Latinos in the United States, and no two people are Latino in the same way. It\u2019s not language that makes you Latino,\u201d Bautista said. The debate is relevant for a growing number of Americans: Currently, a quarter of U.S. children are Latino. For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. In 2021, over 7 in 10 Latinos aged 5 and up spoke English proficiently \u2014 an increase of 59% since 2000 \u2014 according to the Pew Research Center, while there's been a decline in those who speak Spanish at home. As the #nosabo kids say in their own words online, they still hold a connection to their Latino culture despite any language challenges. It's also resulted in Latinos who have decided to learn the language on their own terms in new and creative ways \u2014 and to take a look at how previous generations of Americans were discouraged from speaking Spanish, or even not allowed to. To be on the receiving end of no sabo criticism can be intense, as Diosa Femme, 29, the co-host alongside Mala Mu\u00f1oz of the podcast Locatora Radio, knows.  In late March, a clip of her speaking as a guest on a different podcast about how young Latinos are reclaiming the no sabo identity and how there's been a violent history against speaking Spanish went viral. Femme was labeled a no sabo kid and became public enemy No. 1. \u201cSome of the comments that I got on the video were things like, \u2018I don\u2019t know where these girls are getting their information from. Why is everyone a victim? That\u2019s stupid,\u2019 like really discrediting what I was saying,\u201d said Femme, who\u2019s Peruvian Mexican and actually fluent in Spanish. She grew up in a strict Spanish-speaking household in Los Angeles. The outrage is what motivated Femme and Mu\u00f1oz to produce a two-part podcast episode on the issue to inform newer generations on the subject. \u201cThese are things that happened in the Southwest \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that this was something that would be so contentious,\u201d Femme told NBC News. Most Americans don't know California initially had a bilingual constitution \u2014 the region was formerly Mexican and Spanish. As Hispanics in the state Legislature began to lose political power, so did their right to speak Spanish publicly. The U.S. has had a history of forcing Americans to speak English; this was the case with Native American boarding schools, for example. \"Mexican American children were put through similar violent language training,\u201d Alexandro Jos\u00e9 Gradilla, an associate professor of Chicano/a studies at California State University, Fullerton, said. \u201cThey were physically hit and beat for speaking Spanish at school. \u2026 Teachers had the right to physically punish children.\u201d A notable example took place in Marfa, Texas, at the Blackwell School, which has since been turned into a national historic site.  Built as a segregated school for Mexican American and Mexican children in 1909, students were beaten with paddles and forced to speak only English on campus. In 1954, the school held a mock funeral ceremony and buried slips of paper with Spanish words written on them. The school closed in 1965. Mu\u00f1oz, 31, whose family comes from generations of farmworkers in California\u2019s conservative Kern County, said her relatives struggled with passing down Spanish from generation to generation. \u201cI grew up just constantly hearing the reason dad speaks terrible Spanish is because he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak Spanish. It was kept from him. They were being beaten at school. And that\u2019s why he speaks his Spanglish, and that\u2019s why we speak our hybridized Spanglish,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz, who is Mexican American. Femme said her mother\u2019s name was changed by her elementary school teacher to \u201cMaggie\u201d from Margarita. Her older brother was placed in an English-only track in elementary school after a speech pathologist said he was struggling because he spoke Spanish at home, which was \u201cdetrimental.\u201d \u201cThose examples are more common than we like to realize as a community because we, as Latinos, very much live in a culture of silence where we don\u2019t talk about the things that we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d Femme said. \u201cWhat the no sabo discussion is ignoring is that longer history of our public schools, our public cultures are very English-oriented,\u201d Gradilla said. At the same time, generations of Latinos have been criticized for not speaking Spanish. Decades ago, the term pocho \u2014 like Chicano \u2014 was used as a derogatory term for Mexican Americans who were deemed \u201cni de aqu\u00ed, ni de all\u00e1,\u201d (not from here, not from there). Puerto Ricans born and raised in the U.S. were referred to as \"nuyoricans\" (since so many lived in New York) and criticized for not speaking Spanish like those on the island. Carlos Torres, 31, and Jessica Rosales, 31, a Mexican American couple, both come from families who immigrated from Mexico. Their parents instilled in them that education and learning English were vital paths to success. And though their parents told them it was important to keep speaking Spanish, they didn\u2019t find many opportunities to do so. Torres and Rosales created a card game last April, \u201cYo Sabo,\u201d as a way to remember some tricky Spanish words and help monolingual Latinos reconnect with their childhood.  The card game can be played in three ways: in the first version, a player gives the English word and another guesses the Spanish translation; a second focuses on Latino trivia about Latino customs and traditions; and a third version involves charades. \"Now looking back at our memories, it\u2019s like, how do we help families now that had that challenge and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to keep practicing?\u201d Rosales said. \u201cNow they have something fun to use.\u201d Wendy Ramirez, 46, and Jackie Rodriguez, 35, started Spanish Sin Pena (Spanish Without Shame), a program for those trying to become fluent in Spanish. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realize that even when parents are intentional about keeping the language they already have, it is so difficult because we live in a place where English is spoken everywhere,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cSome parents are just trying to get by and survive and they don\u2019t have the time and space to make it a priority.\u201d Their program came from experience; Ramirez found herself struggling to keep up with Spanish speakers when she was studying in Mexico City. Founded in 2018, Spanish Sin Pena has now grown to more than a thousand registered users per year, mostly Latinos who want to learn Spanish to connect more with their culture. Classes are offered at different levels depending on one\u2019s fluency level. Participants share stories, including tough conversations about their shame at not speaking Spanish and experiences with racism and colorism. But it\u2019s also fun and not always serious \u2014 there are options to learn Spanish through cultural experiences like cooking classes, dance classes and cultural immersion trips to various countries. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to have safe spaces like ours to ask questions and to not make it so heavy,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBeing able to see a whole community of people who share a story that sounds just like yours, that\u2019s healing.\u201d Rodriguez has also been characterized as a no sabo kid but since starting Spanish Sin Pena, she now takes ownership of the term. \u201cI love Spanglish and I\u2019m going to speak it for life and I\u2019m not ashamed about that,\u201d she said. \u201cA language isn\u2019t going to make me any less Latina. It\u2019s in my blood. It\u2019s in my hips. It\u2019s in my saz\u00f3n (seasoning) when I\u2019m cooking.\u201d Veronica Benavides, 36, grew up in Houston and had trouble communicating with her grandmother who only spoke Spanish. In high school, she was shamed for not speaking fluent Spanish by her peers. \u201cMy reaction was to reject it more \u2014 I felt a sense of disconnection there,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t until college that she connected her experiences to history: Her parents didn't teach her Spanish because they attended English-only schools in the Rio Grande Valley and were punished physically and verbally for speaking it. Benavides went on to learn Spanish and referred to herself as a \"s\u00ed sabo kid,\" which helped her develop a greater relationship with her grandmother. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa, this woman had this whole life that I didn\u2019t know about. She had lovers. She had quarrels with her family; she had children that she had lost that I didn\u2019t know about. ... This whole family history, at least with me and my generation, could have been lost,\" Benavides said. In 2021, Benavides launched Bilingual Generation, which partners with schools and families to deliver programs that support bilingualism as a tool for academic success. This academic year, she's working with the school system she once attended as a kid in Aldine, a Houston suburb, to help bring dual language programming. Torres, the \"Yo Sabo\" card game co-creator, said, that in the end, \"Language is so fluid. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you know or how little you know \u2014 we\u2019re all in this really together, just learning. ... We need to stop being our harshest critics.\u201d Edwin Flores reports and produces for NBC Latino and is based in Anaheim, California.

        "title": "'We did not know what they were doing': Ruby Franke's sisters share new video statements",
        "content": "Two sisters of Ruby Franke, the family vlogger charged with six counts of felony child abuse, said in video statements Wednesday they were unaware of her alleged behavior. Julie Deru, who has a family channel called \u201cDeru Crew Vlogs,\u201d and Bonnie Hoellein, also a vlogger, published separate videos on their respective channels saying they had been out of touch with Franke for several years. Franke and her husband, Kevin, had amassed 2.5 million subscribers on their now-removed family channel, \u201c8 Passengers.\u201d The channel featured vlogs with their six children.  Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt, Franke\u2019s business partner and regular collaborator, were arrested Aug. 30 and charged with six counts of felony child abuse by the Washington County, Utah, Attorney\u2019s Office. Law enforcement officers found one of Franke\u2019s children with open wounds after the child escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s home. One of Franke\u2019s other children was found in similar malnourished condition at Hildebrandt\u2019s home. Four of the six children are minors and have been placed in the care of Utah\u2019s Division of Child and Family Services. \u201cWe did not know what they were doing because like we said, we were cut off,\u201d Hoellein said in her video, titled \u201cI am not my sister. I am not my Sisters Crimes.\u201d \u201cWe did not have access to anyone.\u201d Deru similarly said she had lost touch with Franke, saying that three years ago, the last time they spoke, \u201cthings seemed to be fine.\u201d  \u201cThe past few weeks have been extremely hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are kind of in complete shock, still, as to what she had done, because we had no idea of what was happening. I had no idea what was happening.\u201d Deru and Hoellein, as well as lawyers for Franke and Hildebrandt, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.  Deru said that the last time they were in touch, Franke had been getting therapy counseling for the family. Deru said she was skeptical of Hildebrandt and ConneXions, her life coaching service. \u201cWe all felt weird about this Jodi lady,\u201d Deru said in her video, titled \u201cMy Side of the Story Concerning my Sister Ruby Franke.\u201d \u201cWe weren\u2019t comfortable with it. We didn\u2019t like it. We didn\u2019t like the teachings Ruby was bringing to the family functions. And we were this close to telling her, \u2018If you come to our family events anymore, we do not want to hear what you are learning through ConneXions, because we don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u201d Franke abruptly stopped responding to outreach attempts, Deru said.  Franke \u201cstarted all of her lies then\u201d and got \u201crid of all her friends and family,\u201d she said.  In her video, Hoellein said she disagrees with what she described as Franke and Hildebrandt\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d parenting tactics. \u201cI knew they were weird. I knew that they were off. Those are the things that we kept quiet about, because what was I going to say?\u201d Hoellein said.  However, she added, \u201cI was not going to come out and publicly say that I don\u2019t like my sister and I don\u2019t like what she\u2019s doing and I think she\u2019s weird.\u201d About a year ago, Hoellein said, she reconnected with one of Franke\u2019s daughters, who is now an adult. That\u2019s when she said she learned more about her sister\u2019s alleged behavior. Deru also said in her video that she and also reconnected with one of Franke's daughters once she was an adult, and that they have formed a \u201cclose, strong relationship.\u201d Hoellein had published a video on her channel titled \u201cMy Statement on My Sister Ruby Franke,\u201d in which she wrote in the description: \u201cIt feels like a weight has been lifted as we now know our nieces and nephews are safe.\u201d A link to the video, which was posted Sept. 1, is now unavailable.  In both videos, she said they did \u201cas much as we could legally\u201d to help her nieces and nephews, without elaborating. Franke and Hildebrandt are being held without bail until their next scheduled court appearance. Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. ",

These are among the quirky experiences being offered on eBay as part of an auction created in an effort to support ongoing labor movements within the entertainment industry. The initiative comes from a group of striking Writers Guild of America members who founded The Union Solidarity Coalition, which aims to connect industry workers across unions, even those not on strike. \u201cWe want to acknowledge that what you\u2019re going through right now is not easy.

One person's viral fake listing joked that for $10,000, you could get Toni Collette to \u201cscream at you from across a dinner table,\u201d like her character did in \u201cHereditary.\" It drew tens of thousands of likes on X, formerly known as Twitter, and dozens of responses from users joking they would eagerly fork over the money. Another popular fake auction included bids to \u201csit in absolute silence\u201d with comedian Nathan Fielder for an hour. Others memed about fake auction items like falling asleep on a FaceTime call with Daniel Kaluuya or partaking in a staring contest with Cillian Murphy. So far, most of the real eBay listings have received a couple dozen bids each. As of Thursday, the most-bid-on auction item across the coalition\u2019s 50 listings is an \u201cAtlanta\u201d script signed by Donald Glover alongside a personal note and a vinyl of Childish Gambino\u2019s \u201cAwaken, My Love!\u201d Since the WGA went on strike in early May, and the actors' guild, SAG-AFTRA, joined in July, union members have launched various efforts to support one another while incomes stall. WGA members hosted an online garage sale that raised more than $170,000 this summer, and have also set up a mutual aid fund providing grocery grants to strikers. \u201cWhile the studios\u2019 inaction prolongs the strikes, the creative community has turned to taking care of each other,\u201d a WGA spokesperson wrote in a statement to NBC News. \u201cTUSC, WGA Garage Sale, and the Green Envelope Grocery Fund are just three of many incredible examples of how members of Hollywood\u2019s labor unions are coming together to raise money and aid for the people being financially impacted by our fight for sustainable jobs that allow workers to share in the success of the products they create.\u201d The auctions end on Sept. 22.

        "title": "Drew Barrymore's alleged stalker arrested looking for Emma Watson at New York Fashion Week, police say",
        "content": "A man who was charged with stalking Drew Barrymore last month has been arrested again in New York City, this time accused of trying to find actor Emma Watson backstage at a fashion show. Chad Busto, 43, was arrested Friday and charged with two counts each of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Charging documents filed in Kings County court alleged he broke into the backstage area of a fashion show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. A police officer wrote in the filing that the property was fenced or enclosed to prevent \u201cintruders,\u201d yet Busto somehow managed to enter despite not having permission to be there.   Busto allegedly entered a dressing area occupied by people working the fashion show and \"repeatedly\" screamed, \u201cI want to marry Emma Watson. Let me speak to Emma Watson. Let me take a photo with Emma Watson,\u201d the charging document said.   The outburst \u201cdisrupted\u201d several people in the dressing room, the document said. The filing said Busto knowingly entered the building unlawfully \u201cwith intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.\" A representative for Watson, 33, one of the stars of the Harry Potter franchise, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's unclear whether Watson was at the event space. The same day, stars like Jennifer Lopez, Julianne Moore and James Marsden attended the Ralph Lauren New York Fashion Show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.   Busto pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Saturday. A spokesperson for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said Busto got supervised release. He's due back in court in connection with the alleged Watson incident on Oct. 2. A public defender for Busto did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Busto was arrested Aug. 24 after he was seen searching for Barrymore\u2019s Long Island home, days after he crashed an onstage panel she hosted in Manhattan.  Police in Southampton Town on Long Island said they received a report of Busto\u2019s \u201criding a bicycle up into private driveways and stating to area residents that he was looking for Drew Barrymore\u2019s residence.\u201d  He was charged with fourth-degree stalking, a class B misdemeanor.  Just three days before, he approached the stage at the 92nd Street Y, a Manhattan cultural center, where Barrymore was leading a conversation with singer/actor Rene\u00e9 Rapp about her latest album. The incident was recorded on video, which showed the moment Busto approached the stage shouting: \u201cMy name is Chad Michael Busto. You know who I am.\u201d  \u201cI need to see you at some point while you\u2019re in New York, OK?\u201d he said, before he was approached by security officers. Rapp appeared startled, got up, grabbed Barrymore and rushed her offstage. Diana Dasrath is entertainment producer and senior reporter for NBC News covering all platforms. Breaking News Reporter ",

        "title": "Kathy Griffin denounces Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis for their support of Danny Masterson",
        "content": "Kathy Griffin called out people who protect sexual predators after Ashton Kutcher and his wife, Mila Kunis, wrote character letters defending convicted rapist Danny Masterson. Griffin referred to a personal experience about her efforts to have her brother Ken Griffin, whom she accused of being a pedophile, arrested. \"Blood was not thicker than water in my case,\" Griffin said in a video posted to her TikTok and Instagram accounts. \"If you know that somebody is committing [sexual assault] you should do something, if you can.\" Griffin accused her brother, who is deceased, of preying on victims who lived in the Los Angeles apartment building he managed. Griffin said she contacted police twice to try to have him arrested, which caused a \"giant rift\" in her family and led to her being \"shunned.\" She said that ultimately police told her there was nothing they could do without evidence. Ken Griffin never went to prison for the alleged crimes. \"It was a horrible, horrible thing, and I tried to get him caught. Now, this was my brother, so I don\u2019t want to hear about Ashton and Mila and Giovanni Ribisi and people that feel like they had to stick up for Danny Masterson because he was their \u2018bro,\u2019 he was their buddy. This was my own brother,\" she said, adding that she was \"shunned\" by some of her relatives over her attempts to have him jailed. Unlike Griffin's accusations against her brother, Kunis and Kutcher have said they were unaware of the crimes Masterson committed at the time. They came under fire after they wrote letters to the court describing Masterson as an \"excellent\" role model, an \"outstanding older brother figure\" and a \"dedicated and loyal\" husband. During his trial, victims told stories of how Masterson \u201cdrugged and raped\u201d them at his Hollywood Hills home two decades ago and recalled the fallout from their having accused an \"untouchable\" member of the Church of Scientology of being a rapist. \"Throughout our time together, Danny has proven to be an amazing friend, confidant, and, above all, an outstanding older brother figure to me,\" Kunis wrote in her letter. \"His caring nature and ability to offer guidance have been instrumental in my growth both personally and professionally.\" Kutcher wrote that he did not believe Masterson was \"an ongoing harm to society\" and that he hoped his testament to Masterson's character would be \"taken into consideration in sentencing.\" A judge sentenced Masterson last week to 30 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting two women. Following backlash over the letters, Kunis and Kutcher said in a video explanation that Masterson\u2019s family had asked them to characterize \"the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing.\" But Griffin said that is no excuse. \"I don't really care that when they were working on 'That \u201970s Show' he was, like, a good guy to work with and he worked actively to keep people off drugs because he's a Scientologist,\" she said. Christina Ricci also joined the conversation, writing in an Instagram Story that \"sometimes people we have loved and admired do horrible things.\" \"They might not do these things to us and we only know who they were to us but that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t do horrible things and to discredit the abused is a crime,\" she wrote. \"People we know as \u2018awesome guys\u2019 can be predators and abusers. It\u2019s tough to accept but we have to. If we say we support victims \u2014 women, children, men, boys \u2014 then we must be able to take this stance.\" Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News. ",

The tour will kick off in Palm Springs, California, in February and travel across North America and Europe before it wraps up in her hometown, Los Angeles, in August. The \u201cGUTS\u201d World Tour will feature an all-female lineup of opening acts, including The Breeders, PinkPantheress, Remi Wolf and Chappell Roan, who shares a producer with Rodrigo. Rodrigo, 20, a Grammy winner, performed Tuesday night at the MTV Video Music Awards, where she won the best editing category for the \u201cGUTS\u201d lead single, \"Vampire.\" She performed \"Vampire\" and \"Get Him Back!\" In her announcement post, Rodrigo directed fans to her website for ticket registration. Within 15 minutes, the site appeared to crash. \"Can\u2019t even get Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s website to load to register so that bodes well for this whole thing,\" a fan said on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cGUTS\u201d was released to commercial and critical acclaim last Friday by her record label, Geffen Records. Rodrigo rose to overnight fame in 2021 after she released her debut single, \"Driver's License.\" Her first tour for the subsequent record-breaking album, \"Sour,\" was limited to smaller concert venues. For the \"GUTS\" tour, Rodrigo will play arenas, including Madison Square Garden in New York and TD Garden in Boston. Tickets are priced at $49.50 to $199.50 (plus taxes and fees), and part of the ticket sales will go toward Rodrigo\u2019s Fund 4 Good. Registration will be open until Sunday. ",

        "title": "MTV VMAs 2023 highlights: Taylor Swift ties record for most VMA wins in one night",
        "content": "MTV\u2019s biggest music celebration wrapped late Tuesday night after nearly four hours of must-see performances, a surprise guest appearance, record-setting award wins and an epic celebration of the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.  Shakira had a big night when she became the first South American artist to win the Video Vanguard Award, a prestigious merit celebrating an artist\u2019s contributions and impact on music video and pop culture. Ice Spice also won big when she was named Best New Artist.  Taylor Swift had a history-making night when she snagged nine awards including Artist of the Year and Album of the Year for \u201cMidnights.\u201d She is now tied for most wins in one night and has the second most overall wins, according to MTV. In between the awards, *NSYNC made a surprise appearance, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs performed some of his biggest songs and took home the Global Icon Award, and Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Grandmaster Flash, LL Cool J, Darryl \u201cDMC\u201d McDaniels and Doug E. Fresh closed out the show with a medley of hits to celebrate hip-hop. Saba Hamedy A handful of artists took home coveted \"moon person\" statuettes last night. Here's the full list, including the winners who weren't televised. Saba Hamedy According to a final tally of the MTV VMA winners, Taylor Swift ended up winning in nine of the 11 categories she was nominated in. Swift is tied for most wins in one night and now the second most overall wins, according to MTV. Here are the categories Swift won (not all of them were televised): Brahmjot Kaur The night ended with Taylor Swift winning video of the year but without the awards show's announcing the winners from 13 other categories. By midnight ET, the VMAs' X account continued to announce some winners after the show had concluded. Don't worry, we were just as confused as you all. A spokesperson for the show did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Daysia Tolentino This year\u2019s VMAs felt particularly bloated, jamming over 20 performances into the broadcast. At times, it felt like there was very little room to breathe between sets, awards and the many, many ads. Which raises a question \u2014 how does the show feel simultaneously too fast and too slow? The show has seemingly lost the ability to edit itself down. The VMAs is tasked with curating a night that brings in the hottest acts, highlights the most exciting up-and-comers and honors the pioneers of popular music. This is a special year in many ways \u2014 especially with an anniversary as significant as 50 years of hip-hop and an increasing interest in global genres \u2014 which presents a unique challenge to the show. Accomplishing all of these things is no easy task. But if it is done ineffectively, we are left with a lengthy, disjointed show. While the show has clearly identified the biggest stars across genres, it has given barely any of them space to assert themselves. Every performance is followed by another in such quick succession that it has given us whiplash all night. Without the time for artists to create impactful performances or for audiences to process them, it is impossible for the VMAs to create those special, iconic moments that it is known for. The VMAs has had a difficult time coping with our splitting interests. The culture itself is becoming more niche, which makes it difficult to create a universally beloved show. To its credit, the VMAs reflected the diversity of popular culture and music today. Unfortunately, it also spent so much time pandering to our collective nostalgia for its past iterations that the fresh faces almost became afterthoughts. Kaetlyn Liddy We thought we had quite a few categories to go, but the VMAs appears to have abruptly ended \u2013 after almost four hours \u2013 with the video of the year category. Angela Yang Taylor Swift is clearly the hero of the night after she took home MTV\u2019s most prestigious award: a win for \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d as video of the year. The song has already won best pop, song of the year and best direction. \u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Swift said as she accepted the award. \u201cI just want to say that the fact that this is a fan-voted award means so much to me. \u201c Doha Madani I have spent the last hour complaining about being tired, but I just danced in my little office chair like an idiot and sang \"Mama Said Knock You Out\" with all my heart. Nothing like LL Cool J to bring the energy, honestly. Uwa Ede-Osifo The commemoration of hip-hop\u2019s 50th anniversary has seen much fanfare, with museum exhibits dedicated to archiving the fashion and iconography of the genre, in addition to sprawling magazine packages paying tribute to legendary musicians and forgotten innovators alike. The celebration continued today with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five performing \"The Message.\" Other rap royalty who hit the stage included DMC, Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. Minaj rapped the fan favorite \"Itty Bitty Piggy,\" which the audience had no trouble filling in the lyrics for when she turned the mic to them. Chills! Doha Madani My iPhone just hit me with a bedtime reminder at 11:29 p.m. ET, meaning I have officially passed my bedtime. This isn't that different from watching the VMAs 20 years ago, I suppose. Uwa Ede-Osifo \u201cI just want to thank my munchkins,\u201d Ice Spice said in her acceptance speech, also thanking her producer and label. Far from a one-hit wonder, she has achieved meteoric success since the release of her viral 2022 hit \u201cMunch.\u201d The Bronx native known for her signature ginger curls and catchy ad-libs (\u201cLike?\u201d) collabed with Taylor Swift this year and snagged a coveted invitation to the 2023 Met Gala. She in ha mood! Angela Yang It\u2019s 8:15 p.m. in Los Angeles, and West Coast viewers are just getting their first taste of tonight\u2019s never-ending show. Looks like MTV is intent on keeping everyone watching till midnight. Doha Madani Swift is now tied for the most best direction awards in VMAs history, winning the award for her hit single \"Anti-Hero.\" She won the award last year for \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" and once more in 2020 for \"The Man.\" It's gotta feel good for Swift, who recently said she aspires to direct a feature film one day. It was Swift's third win tonight. Saba Hamedy Remember when we thought the show was supposed to end by now ... Doha Madani My favorite part of an awards night is when \"drunk Taylor\" starts to trend on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Now listen, we don't know what she was drinking. But what's clear to us Swifties is she's just a girl in her 30s having a great night with friends \u2014 and her fans are loving it. The official Taylor Nation account retweeted a video of her struggling to get a drink out of her cupholder earlier with the caption \"she's swift af boi.\" Clips and screenshots of her dancing and cheering on her peers made the rounds online as fans celebrated her joy. Brahmjot Kaur Alternative rock legends Fall Out Boy are onstage performing their updated version of Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\" in unusually boxy fits. The song blasts some of the most iconic moments of the last 30 years. The 20-plus-year veterans are back on stage for the first time since 2007, when we all remember bassist Pete Wentz in his guyliner and tight jeans. The emos (including me) can\u2019t handle it. Daysia Tolentino After a big night for both artists, Karol G and Shakira snagged a Moon Man for their song \"TQG.\" This is Karol G's first VMAs. She got the crowd on their feet earlier in the night with her performance of \"T\u00e1 OK\" and \"OKI DOKI.\" Earlier, Shakira was honored with the Video Vanguard Award. Doha Madani I love Fall Out Boy, but if you wanna talk about millennial triggers, this song is reminding me of AP U.S. History in the worst ways. Chloe Melas The entire music industry is happening over the course of 12 hours ... but actually four. Kaetlyn Liddy Nicki Minaj won her first VMA of the evening in the best hip-hop category for \"Super Freaky Girl.\" If anyone was expecting Minaj to \"emcee\" tonight, they're probably wondering where she's been. Her emcee duties may have been light so far, but she is going home with some hardware. Saba Hamedy We knew the show may go over but ... this is definitely a longer evening than we thought. Daysia Tolentino And she doesn't appreciate them! Introducing the Stray Kids' performance, Saweetie acknowledged her pre-show pink carpet slip-ups \u2014 and the internet's reactions to them. \"Y'all better stop making my last video go viral,\" she said. \"I see what you're doing. Anyways, let's try it again.\" Uwa Ede-Osifo Nigerian artist Rema won best Afrobeats for his remixed single \u201cCalm Down\u201d with Selena Gomez, which also surpassed a billion streams on Spotify this weekend. \"This means so much seeing Afrobeats grow this big,\" Rema said. \"I will not forget to shout out the people who opened the doors to me. Shout out to Fela, who started Afrobeats in the first place,\" he added, referring to Fela Kuti, among contemporary stars including Burna Boy, Don Jazzy and Wizkid. Gomez also took stage, thanking Rema for allowing her to be a part of the record. Afrobeats has had an international fan base for a while (\u201cAfrica to the World!\u201d). The musical genre fuses sounds of dancehall, African percussion, hip-hop and other acoustic art forms.  The VMAs added a best Afrobeats category this year after the Grammys and the American Music Awards announced similar awards in recognition of African musicians. About time! Brahmjot Kaur There appear to be more than 10 categories left tonight ... and more performances on deck. But only about 30 minutes left of the show. The fast-paced performances and quick transitions couldn't seem to save the show from probably going over. Uwa Ede-Osifo Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was honored with the global icon award. \u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d he said while accepting the award. \u201cI grew up watching MTV like \u2018Man I wish I could be up there.\u2019 The mogul rose to prominence in the \u201990s producing for the late Notorious B.I.G. and later built a reputation as a formidable rapper with hits including \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d (a tribute to Biggie). \"I started out as a paper boy, y\u2019all, at 12, and then I was going to be a NFL football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers,\" he said in his speech. The team \"didn\u2019t know this, but I planned on being a football player; then my leg got broke.\" Later in life, he said, people would see him dancing in New York City and cast him for videos. \"That\u2019s how I fell in love with the music industry,\" he said, thanking industry executives, songwriters and the Bad Boy family. Mary J. Blige introduced the accolade, crediting Diddy with launching her own career. \u201cHe is an incredible triumph. And nobody deserves to be called an icon more than this man.\u201d Saba Hamedy It\u2019s a family affair. One of Diddy's daughters, Chance, helped introduce the artist as he received his global icon award. Chloe Melas Sean \"Diddy\" Combs took the stage to perform hits like \"I'll Be Missing You,\" one of his most popular hits from 1997, which is a reworking of the popular 1983 hit \"Every Breath You Take\" by the Police. But that was just the beginning of his epic performance. Combs, who is being honored with the global icon award, also sang \"Bad Boy for Life\" and \"I Need a Girl Pt 2,\" just to name a few. He also brought out fellow artists like Keyshia Cole to perform \"Last Night.\" This is bringing me back! Doha Madani Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift posed for a sweet photo together tonight, both looking unbelievable, I have to say. These two are proof that boyfriends may come and go but a best friend is forever. They met when they started dating Jonas brothers as teenagers and have stuck together ever since. Also, someone give Gomez's new stylist her flowers, because she is just stunning left and right lately. Uwa Ede-Osifo The neck-breaking speed at which the performances and presenters were moving earlier in the night seems to be slowing down to a more sustainable pace, thankfully! The highlight of the night has been the camaraderie and love among all the stars. And of course, the musicians, as always, have had stunning dance ensembles choreographed to a T. So far, no mind-altering moments or provocative incidents have occurred. But the night is still young! Neither *NSYNC nor the storied hip-hop pioneers have taken the stage yet, so we shall see ... Doha Madani Anitta, a beloved Brazilian artist, just beat out Bad Bunny, Shakira and Karol G for the best Latin award. \"I want to thank myself, because I work so hard, oh, my God,\" she said. Earlier in the evening, she joked that she was hoping to take the moon person statue back with her to Brazil, because she keeps her first VMA award in her Miami house. Daysia Tolentino In anticipation of the release of \"Pink Friday 2\" in November, the rapper performed her latest single off the album \"Last Time I Saw You\" and debuted a new song. Chloe Melas Before he introduced Nicki Minaj's performance, Billy Porter turned around to give a shoutout to Taylor Swift, who was seated behind him. He said he owes Swift for helping him receive his very own moon man when he starred in her music video for \"You Need to Calm Down\" in 2019. Porter is a #swiftie just like us. He also congratulated Shakira on her award. Brahmjot Kaur Shakira is taking home the MTV Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award after she performed a career-spanning medley of her greatest hits \u2014 a tradition for the award's recipients. The award is presented \"in recognition of an artist's overall achievements in music and film but is sometimes handed out as a lifetime achievement award,\" according to MTV. \"Thank you, MTV, for being part of my career since I was 18 years old,\" Shakira said in her acceptance speech. She also thanked her creative partners who helped bring her music videos to life and her kids, whom she brought to the show. Shakira, who performed at the VMAs for the first time in 14 years, is the first South American and the second Latina to win the award. The Colombian pop star sold 95 million records worldwide, making her the best-selling artist of all time. She also won numerous awards, including four Moon Persons, three Grammys, 12 Latin Grammys and 41 Billboard Latin Music Awards. Chloe Melas Shakira is putting on a 10-minute show-stopping performance featuring a medley of her greatest hits. But viewers of the VMAs on social media began to wonder whether she is lip syncing. It's not uncommon for artists who have extreme dance routines to sing to a track. Regardless, Shakira is a musical queen. Her hips don't lie, and we love her for it. Saba Hamedy Can you type and dance at the same time? Asking for a friend. Daysia Tolentino The VMAs has struggled to find its footing in recent years, and it's becoming very apparent as the night goes on that it is relying very heavily on our collective nostalgia for the show. However, an overreliance of nostalgia lends to a dearth of original culture. It's no wonder the VMAs lacks those iconic cultural moments these days \u2014 it is looking s much into the past that it is unable to drive culture into the future! Uwa Ede-Osifo If one thing can be taken away from Doja Cat's music, it's that the star is unapologetic about doing whatever she wants. She performed the single \"Attention\" off her forthcoming album with lyrics alluding to the pressures of being in the public eye (\"Look at me/ Look at me / You lookin'?\") Her dancers were covered in red paint, a nod to the title of her album, \"Scarlet.\" Plus Ice Spice gave a cute shoutout to Doja Cat before she went onstage, plugging that she will be joining the pop star on her latest tour! Brahmjot Kaur Nostalgic or cheugy? The 2000s icons presenting awards is starting to feel a little forced and dare I say \u2014 a little cheugy. (Sorry to Ashanti.) Daysia Tolentino SZA's \"Shirt\" snagged the award for best R&B, but the singer wasn't present to accept the moon statue. Doha Madani French Montana, a Moroccan American, announced he'll be creating an emergency fund for victims of the earthquake in Morocco. \"Before we get to the nominees, I want to spread some love and light to Morocco. They\u2019ve been hit with a big earthquake,\" he said. \"I\u2019m setting up our emergency fund with globalcitizen.org/morocco, and I will be donating myself.\" More than 2,900 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the North African country this weekend. Kaetlyn Liddy Taylor Swift wins her second VMA of the night for \"Anti-Hero.\" For those counting, that\u2019s 2/11. She gave a shoutout to her producer, Jack Antonoff, and their first collaboration together, \"1989,\" in her acceptance speech. \"We'll be making music together until 2089,\" she said. Saba Hamedy About 45 minutes into the show and most of the NBC team live blogging agrees: How can there be any memorable moments if the show is going so fast? As Uwa said on Slack, \"it seems like its scheduled by the second.\" Added Kaetlyn, \"This pace is for the TikTok generation.\" Angela Yang Stray Kids took home the best K-Pop award for its single \u201cS-Class.\" \u201cWe\u2019ve been making music ever since the start of our career, but to receive this award just really means a lot to us,\u201d Bang Chan said. This is the group\u2019s first-ever VMA win, making it a big moment for members Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin and I.N. \u201cWe really want to dedicate that award to the fans, as well,\u201d Bang Chan said on the carpet ahead of the show. Kaetlyn Liddy I love that the VMAs are celebrating so many different genres of music, but these quick transitions are giving me whiplash. We moved on very quickly from Cardi B to Demi ... give her some applause! Daysia Tolentino Lovato has been returning to her pop-rock roots in recent years, and she performed rock versions of her three biggest hits at the VMAs. The crowd went wild as she performed \"Heart Attack,\" \"Sorry Not Sorry\" and \"Cool for the Summer.\" All three songs will be in her coming album \"Revamped,\" featuring 10 rock versions of her old songs. We need the rerecording of \"La La Land\" now. Or another \"Camp Rock\" film. Uwa Ede-Osifo When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion are on a track together, trust that it will be a song to remember. The pair, who previously put out the provocative hit \"WAP,\" performed their latest collaboration, \"Bongos,\" with a tropical dance number in suit. Saba Hamedy Editor's note: Please excuse us in advance if the live blog goes dark at some point during the show. If and when *NSYNC performs, the team will likely have passed out. If our bosses are reading this, we're kidding. Doha Madani Taylor Swift won the VMA for the best pop video. Honestly, how deserved. This was a jampacked category with some stiff competition, but this was a much-talked-about hit. \"I'm not doing well pivoting from this to this,\" she said while accepting the award from *NSYNC. \"I had your dolls. Are you doing something? What's going to happen now? They're going to do something, and I need to know what it is. You're pop personified \u2014 to receive this from your golden pop hands is really, it's too much.\" She thanked the band for giving her friendship bracelets as she got onstage. Doha Madani Taylor Swift was screaming over *NSYNC; she's just like me for real. Angela Yang ICYMI: Wondering if it was intentional that the camera panned to Taylor Swift applauding as soon as Nicki Minaj mentioned Olivia? Doha Madani It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie. All five members *NSYNC have come together for the first time since 2013, when Justin Timberlake was honored with the VMAs Vanguard Award. Timberlake was joined onstage tonight by Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez and Joey Fatone. And mine at home because they are tearin' up my little millennial heart. It's been rumored that the men are making new music together for Universal Pictures' coming \"Trolls Band Together\" film. Uwa Ede-Osifo Part of the beauty of the VMAs is its unpredictability. Who would've thought a performance by Lil Wayne would be followed by Olivia Rodrigo? Whiplash or an interesting blend of past and present stars? Daysia Tolentino Hot off the release of her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" Rodrigo performed the lead single, \"vampire,\" during the opening performance of the VMAs. And those seemingly technical glitches? Not to worry \u2014 all a part of the show. Rodrigo re-created the stage issues from the \"vampire\" music video before she transitioned to the new fan favorite \"get him back!\" off \"Guts.\" Doha Madani My girl Slaylor Swift, the most nominated artist of the night, is officially in the house. But her arrival was announced at the very end of the pre-show, so we didn't get any interview moments, but Swift did show off her look on the pink carpet. In all black, I have to wonder whether she's re-entering her \"reputation\" era. Uwa Ede-Osifo The legendary rapper Lil Wayne knows how to put on a show. Tunechi had the audience on their feet, waving their hands in the air to an energetic rendition of his single \"Uproar,\" followed by a performance of \"Kat Food.\" Angela Yang The VMAs are officially kicking off after a dazzling performance from Sabrina Carpenter during the pre-show. So far, Tomorrow X Together and Dove Cameron have already taken home awards for push performance and video for good, respectively. Daysia Tolentino The singer brought her signature wit to the pre-show with a custom outro to \"Nonsense\" in honor of the VMAs. \"He say it bigger than a Moon Man / Guess that means I'm holding it with two hands / VMAs, I love you / I\u2019m a huge fan,\u201d she sang. Real fans know she has a new outro for every occasion, and the VMAs are no different! Kaetlyn Liddy Dove Cameron's \"Breakfast\" took home the moon person for video for good. \u201cTelling meaningful messages in my music and in my videos is super important to me,\" Cameron said in her acceptance speech. The video's concept, she previously told \"TODAY,\" was a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. \"It\u2019s unfair for one gender to carry the entirety of the weight of the reproductive conversation,\" she said. In the music video, she and other women harass a male employee who is later shown getting an abortion. At the end, footage from marches is played in support of reproductive rights. Daysia Tolentino Viewers can choose among the top three nominees for best new artist using a Snapchat filter. The filter is called \"Best New Artist Lens,\" and users can cast their votes by gesturing 1, 2 or 3 with their fingers. The race for best new artist has narrowed to three contenders: Ice Spice, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Peso Pluma. Viewers can also vote on the VMAs website. Kaetlyn Liddy I love that the VMAs say they are \"music's most iconic night.\" Not the most important, but definitely the most iconic. Angela Yang Kelsea Ballerini is celebrating her birthday at the VMAs this year. The country singer said she's celebrating her 30th at the awards show. \"I\u2019m overstimulated in every way,\" she said during the pre-show carpet interview. \"But you know, listen, just to be able to perform on an all-genre show like this and represent country music hopefully well.\" She said she's excited to be at the show with her boyfriend, Chase Stokes, and her mom. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s been such a huge year in my personal life and my career, and I feel really happy to be able to just present that tonight on this show.\" Doha Madani Tonight's proving that artists are fans just like us. During the carpet pre-show, Karol G and Anitta expressed kind words for Shakira, whose Latin representation meant so much to them. Karol G, a fellow Colombian, is nominated with Shakira for the best Latin award, while Anitta is competing against them both. \"I think Shakira for us was a big, big influence ... to make us believe that it's possible being a Latina and getting here and showing our culture and everything,\" Anitta said during the pre-show. Personally, Shakira means a lot to me, too, as the daughter of Lebanese immigrants. My parents always pointed to her half-Lebanese heritage for an example for us in mainstream media. Brahmjot Kaur During her pre-show interview, Shakira teased her performance that will encompass her decadeslong career. \"I think it's a pretty dynamic performance. I hope it's not too long,\" she said. The Colombian pop star also shared her experience envisioning and creating her larger-than-life music videos. \"Videos are a way to express whatever I couldn't finish expressing with my lyrics. Visuals are so powerful,\" she said. Shakira might worry the performance will be too long, but I think we'll all love it too much to think about the duration. Saba Hamedy Tiffany Haddish promoted her song \u201cTill The Club Closes\u201d (with Lil Jon & Fivio Foreign) during her VMAs carpet appearance. \"I've been taking my savings and putting into the things I love,\" she said. \"'I've been creating all this really great music.\" She joked that the last time she partied until the club closed was four days ago, when she maybe took a nap in the club.  I'd do the same. Daysia Tolentino Is it us, or does it feel like everyone doing interviews on the carpet seems excited to be at the VMAs because they grew up watching it? Angela Yang Tomorrow X Together is the first to receive a VMA tonight, winning Push performance of the year for its song \u201cSugar Rush Ride.\u201d It's the South Korean boy band's first ever VMA win. \u201cTonight is a night we will remember forever. Thank you VMAs,\u201d Huening Kai said. The group will debut its new song \u201cBack for More\u201d with Anitta later. Daysia Tolentino During a pre-show interview, Cardi B said \u201chip-hop is everything\" to her. She gave a shoutout to her hometown, the Bronx, the birthplace of the genre. Tonight, there will be a celebratory performance commemorating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. Cardi B also shared her appreciation for \"Bongos\" collaborator Megan Thee Stallion. \"We work so great together. She's hard-working. I'm hard-working. ... She trusts me, and I trust her,\" she said of their friendship. The two rappers are also expected to perform their new single tonight.  Brahmjot Kaur Is tonight going to be a nostalgia fest? It already feels like the VMAs are leaning into (and possibly relying on?) nostalgia by previewing this hip-hop tribute and having Nelly perform alongside NLE Choppa. Brahmjot Kaur Saweetie says her pink look, featuring a bone (?), is \u201cfresh off the runway.\u201d The inspiration is \u201ccaveman days\u201d or \u201cfashion when it first started.\u201d She kind of looks like the yassification of \"The Flintstones,\" and we're here for it. Saba Hamedy Not us gasping at Nelly performing \"Hot In Herre.\" This millennial is feeling nostalgic. Daysia Tolentino Megan Thee Stallion is bringing hot girl energy in a custom Brandon Blackwood corset dress at the VMAs red carpet. The rapper will be performing her new single \"Bongos,\" featuring Cardi B, later tonight. Doha Madani The pre-show has officially begun! Hosted by Saweetie, the pre-show will actually reveal the night\u2019s first big winners in addition to interviews as stars begin to arrive on the pink carpet. Saba Hamedy Beloved boy band *NSYNC is rumored to be reuniting at the VMAs. Fans are convinced that the group is dropping a new song for the third installment of the \"Trolls\" franchise and could be headed to the MTV awards show to promote it. Justin Timberlake, the band's front-runner, has voiced Branch in the films. The film's trailer teased a storyline about a boy band called \u201cBrozone\" getting back together. (\u201cTrolls Band Together\u201d is distributed by Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation. NBC News and Universal Pictures are both owned by NBCUniversal). We hope they don't tear up our hearts and that this rumor is true. Doha Madani Karol G showed up at the pink carpet with pink hair and an outfit I'm extremely jealous of. Karol, who is nominated for the best Latin category tonight, showed up with a sheer gown and a matching coat that honestly looks really comfortable. The Colombian superstar just absolutely kills in this look. Although she's competing against Bad Bunny and her collaborator Shakira, Karol G is a real contender tonight. Earlier this summer she broke a \"TODAY\" record by drawing more than 15,000 people to the plaza for the Citi Concert Series. Angela Yang Olivia Rodrigo turned heads on the pink carpet with her sparkly outfit. The pop star has made a lot of headlines lately with the release of her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" and fan speculation surrounding who lyrics from some of the songs are about. Many online continue to speculate that the \"Driver's License\" singer has a feud with Taylor Swift. The prolific female artists are up in several of the same categories this year \u2014 at a time when fans of both artists are relentlessly fanning the speculative flames. In 2021, Rodrigo raved about meeting Swift in person. Swift also sent Rodrigo a special gift. But after the release of her first album, \u201cSour,\u201d fans sensed a vibe shift. Rodrigo ended up giving Swift and Jack Antonoff co-writing credits on her songs \u201c1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\u201d and \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d for which Rodrigo said she took inspiration from Swift\u2019s \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d and \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d respectively. Since that first album\u2019s release, Rodrigo has appeared to express less public adoration for Swift in social media posts. In June, Rodrigo\u2019s single \u201cVampire\u201d prompted some to theorize that the song was inspired by Swift and the music industry. Asked about it by The Guardian, Rodrigo said she was \u201csurprised\u201d people thought it was about Swift. In an interview with Rolling Stone published today, Rodrigo finally addressed the rumors directly. \u201cI don\u2019t have beef with anyone. I\u2019m very chill. I keep to myself.\u201d Saba Hamedy It's a big year for Combs at the VMAs. The artist will receive the third-ever Global Icon Award, which MTV says \"celebrates an artist or band whose unparalleled career and continued influence have achieved a unique level of global success in music and beyond.\" Past recipients are Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Combs, who is also nominated for four other awards, will also perform. NBC News Yesterday, the New York Post published this hot take: \"Why the MTV VMAs \u2014 once the hottest awards show around \u2014 don\u2019t matter anymore.\" We, the NBC News team live blogging tonight, had some thoughts. Doha: The VMAs are a casualty of a larger issue of awards shows slowly losing social relevance, either because they\u2019re too polished or because social media makes celebrities less reliant on traditional platforms to make news. Even still, the VMAs are the most enjoyable show in the genre and the show most focused on fans. Kaetlyn: It\u2019s true that the VMAs might not \u201cmatter\u201d as much as other awards shows, but that is exactly what makes them fun to watch. The VMAs don\u2019t have the gravity of the Oscars or the Grammys. It\u2019s not the biggest night in any industry, but that sets the celebs free in a way. Brahmjot: I think the awards and categories themselves are unmemorable, but the VMAs have always been a pop culture gold mine for viewers to ogle, reminisce about and cringe at. Angela: As MTV grows ever further removed from the way we consume music, I hope artists will take the VMAs as an opportunity to experiment more with live appearances even in the age of streaming. Daysia: Once considered the night for iconic pop cultural moments, the VMAs are kind of in their flop era. When was the last time that the show truly delivered a provocative, dominating cultural moment? While it continues to provide solid live performances and has spawned a couple of memes in recent years, the awards show is losing touch with the culture. The issue could be that we\u2019ve seen it all. Doha Madani We can\u2019t talk about jaw-dropping VMA moments without recounting Miley Cyrus\u2019 2013 performance of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d with Robin Thicke. Cyrus was in only a pair of latex underwear at one point during the song, thrusting against a foam finger between her legs and later twerking against Thicke\u2019s crotch. The scene was quite a scandal, and it was discussed in interviews for years. Cyrus was only two years out from the end of her Disney Channel show, \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d and people seemed to take some issue with her dramatic change in image. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Cyrus argued that no one seemed to take issue with Thicke even though he was well aware of the performance. \u201cI\u2019ve just always been a very open person ... so I\u2019ve tried to wrap my head around what a normal person thinks of the performance, and I can\u2019t really understand where the shock comes from,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cI know that sounds crazy, but ... I don\u2019t see anything more than what any other artist did that night.\u201d Thicke told Oprah Winfrey that things can sometimes appear different during rehearsal and that the performance seemed more silly than sexual to him at the time. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just not as normal as I thought I was,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offended by it personally, because I think some see that and they go, \u2018This is so sexual.\u2019 And to me, I\u2019m sitting there going: \u2018This is whacky. This is funny to me.\u2019\u201d Doha Madani Awards shows are best remembered for their unscripted moments, including the 2000 VMAs, where a rockstar got arrested. Rage Against the Machine was nominated for best rock video but ultimately lost to Limp Bizkit\u2019s \u201cBreak Stuff.\u201d As Limp Bizkit tried to accept the award, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed the scaffolding and sat on top of a large sculpture onstage. No one had any clue what was going on, though members of Limp Bizkit encouraged him to jump off the sculpture. Toni Braxton and 98 Degrees stood dumbfounded as they went on to present the next award, and security was trying to get Commerford down. Eventually Commerford was gotten down and arrested. Bandmate Tom Morello told Rolling Stone at the time that he felt police overreacted but that he believes Commerford was mistaken for a crazed fan. In reality, he just didn\u2019t like Limp Bizkit. Commerford told Rolling Stone in 2015 that he had only one regret. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve swung on that thing and brought it to the ground and just destroyed it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could do it all over again, I would\u2019ve ripped that thing to the ground and shredded it.\u201d Doha Madani There\u2019s absolutely no argument that the most memorable VMA moment in history is the kiss heard \u2019round the world. At the 2003 awards show, Madonna performed a mashup of her songs \u201cLike A Virgin\u201d and \u201cHollywood\u201d with pop sensations Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. At the very end, Madonna turned to Spears and kissed her before she turned to lay her lips on Aguilera, as well.  Many people forget that Aguilera was also a part of the kiss, maybe because Spears got the shock value of being first. Either way, this is one image seared into pop culture history.  Doha Madani Lady Gaga, she\u2019s got the meat. Lady Gaga offered the world one of the most bizarre red carpet looks in fashion history at the 2010 VMAs. Gaga arrived in a dress covered in meat. Yes, actual raw meat. Gaga recounted the look in an interview with British Vogue in 2021, explaining that the dress was actually a corset that had meat sewn into it. The outfit was a protest of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d a military policy that discriminated against queer service members and was ultimately repealed in 2011. \u201cWe decided to do the meat dress because I thought to myself if you\u2019re willing to die for your country, what does it matter how you identify?\u201d Gaga said. Onstage, Gaga announced the name of her coming album, \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d and sang a snippet from the title track. \u201cHow beautiful in my way, because God makes no mistakes. I\u2019m on the right track, baby, I was born this way,\u201d she sang in the dress. Doha Madani The VMAs may only be an elder millennial, but the awards ceremony has some iconic pop culture moments that we won't forget. As NBC News' chief Swiftie, I can tell you all about one uncomfortable September night in 2009 with great detail, but I'll spare you every detail. Taylor Swift had just won best female video for \"You Belong With Me,\" her first VMA win, when Ye jumped onstage. Ye, the artist formally known as Kanye West, grabbed the mic from Swift as she was giving her thank you speech. \"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you,\" he said. \"Imma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time.\" People booed. Beyonc\u00e9 looked visibly uncomfortable. And Swift was devastated. Beyonc\u00e9 went on to win the video of the year award and offered her time to Swift, who returned to a standing ovation. Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift never appeared to have any bad blood between them following the incident, though the same can't be said for Swift and Ye. The moment unwittingly opened a series of events that included a presidential dis, two \u201cSNL\u201d monologues, a naked wax figure of Swift, an edited phone call clip, an online fan war and an album dedicated to Swift's reputation (which she'll be re-recording soon). But I'm not going to talk about that in my blog post! La la la la la! Saba Hamedy Read more about the star-studded list of performers and nominations on Today.com. Saba Hamedy Shakira is being honored with the Video Vanguard Award. She will also perform at the awards show for the first time since 2006. We expect, per usual, that her hips won't lie. But looks like she's got a lot more in store, per an Instagram post from last week in which she shared: \"POV when you\u2019re trying to cram an entire career into one #VMAs Vanguard performance.\" Saba Hamedy Saba Hamedy Here are the 11 categories the Eras Tour queen is nominated for: Chloe Melas Technically, no one is \"hosting\" the VMAs this year. But Nicki Minaj is emceeing, as she did last year. \u201cMinaj will announce the show\u2019s star-studded lineup of performers, presenters and winners,\" MTV said in a news release. If that sounds like a hosting gig, that's because it kind of is, without the title. According to a source at MTV familiar with the awards show, no one can labeled as a \"host\" because of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Saba Hamedy The ceremony will air live at 8 p.m. ET on MTV in more than 150 million countries. For those of you who can't get enough of the celebs, the pre-show starts at 6:30 p.m. ET, and our live blog kicks off at 4 p.m. Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News. Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News. Pronouns: she/her. Saba Hamedy A handful of artists took home coveted \"moon person\" statuettes last night. Here's the full list, including the winners who weren't televised. Saba Hamedy According to a final tally of the MTV VMA winners, Taylor Swift ended up winning in nine of the 11 categories she was nominated in. Swift is tied for most wins in one night and now the second most overall wins, according to MTV. Here are the categories Swift won (not all of them were televised): Brahmjot Kaur The night ended with Taylor Swift winning video of the year but without the awards show's announcing the winners from 13 other categories. By midnight ET, the VMAs' X account continued to announce some winners after the show had concluded. Don't worry, we were just as confused as you all. A spokesperson for the show did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Daysia Tolentino This year\u2019s VMAs felt particularly bloated, jamming over 20 performances into the broadcast. At times, it felt like there was very little room to breathe between sets, awards and the many, many ads. Which raises a question \u2014 how does the show feel simultaneously too fast and too slow? The show has seemingly lost the ability to edit itself down. The VMAs is tasked with curating a night that brings in the hottest acts, highlights the most exciting up-and-comers and honors the pioneers of popular music. This is a special year in many ways \u2014 especially with an anniversary as significant as 50 years of hip-hop and an increasing interest in global genres \u2014 which presents a unique challenge to the show. Accomplishing all of these things is no easy task. But if it is done ineffectively, we are left with a lengthy, disjointed show. While the show has clearly identified the biggest stars across genres, it has given barely any of them space to assert themselves. Every performance is followed by another in such quick succession that it has given us whiplash all night. Without the time for artists to create impactful performances or for audiences to process them, it is impossible for the VMAs to create those special, iconic moments that it is known for. The VMAs has had a difficult time coping with our splitting interests. The culture itself is becoming more niche, which makes it difficult to create a universally beloved show. To its credit, the VMAs reflected the diversity of popular culture and music today. Unfortunately, it also spent so much time pandering to our collective nostalgia for its past iterations that the fresh faces almost became afterthoughts. Kaetlyn Liddy We thought we had quite a few categories to go, but the VMAs appears to have abruptly ended \u2013 after almost four hours \u2013 with the video of the year category. Angela Yang Taylor Swift is clearly the hero of the night after she took home MTV\u2019s most prestigious award: a win for \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d as video of the year. The song has already won best pop, song of the year and best direction. \u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Swift said as she accepted the award. \u201cI just want to say that the fact that this is a fan-voted award means so much to me. \u201c Doha Madani I have spent the last hour complaining about being tired, but I just danced in my little office chair like an idiot and sang \"Mama Said Knock You Out\" with all my heart. Nothing like LL Cool J to bring the energy, honestly. Uwa Ede-Osifo The commemoration of hip-hop\u2019s 50th anniversary has seen much fanfare, with museum exhibits dedicated to archiving the fashion and iconography of the genre, in addition to sprawling magazine packages paying tribute to legendary musicians and forgotten innovators alike. The celebration continued today with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five performing \"The Message.\" Other rap royalty who hit the stage included DMC, Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. Minaj rapped the fan favorite \"Itty Bitty Piggy,\" which the audience had no trouble filling in the lyrics for when she turned the mic to them. Chills! Doha Madani My iPhone just hit me with a bedtime reminder at 11:29 p.m. ET, meaning I have officially passed my bedtime. This isn't that different from watching the VMAs 20 years ago, I suppose. Uwa Ede-Osifo \u201cI just want to thank my munchkins,\u201d Ice Spice said in her acceptance speech, also thanking her producer and label. Far from a one-hit wonder, she has achieved meteoric success since the release of her viral 2022 hit \u201cMunch.\u201d The Bronx native known for her signature ginger curls and catchy ad-libs (\u201cLike?\u201d) collabed with Taylor Swift this year and snagged a coveted invitation to the 2023 Met Gala. She in ha mood! Angela Yang It\u2019s 8:15 p.m. in Los Angeles, and West Coast viewers are just getting their first taste of tonight\u2019s never-ending show. Looks like MTV is intent on keeping everyone watching till midnight. Doha Madani Swift is now tied for the most best direction awards in VMAs history, winning the award for her hit single \"Anti-Hero.\" She won the award last year for \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" and once more in 2020 for \"The Man.\" It's gotta feel good for Swift, who recently said she aspires to direct a feature film one day. It was Swift's third win tonight. Saba Hamedy Remember when we thought the show was supposed to end by now ... Doha Madani My favorite part of an awards night is when \"drunk Taylor\" starts to trend on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Now listen, we don't know what she was drinking. But what's clear to us Swifties is she's just a girl in her 30s having a great night with friends \u2014 and her fans are loving it. The official Taylor Nation account retweeted a video of her struggling to get a drink out of her cupholder earlier with the caption \"she's swift af boi.\" Clips and screenshots of her dancing and cheering on her peers made the rounds online as fans celebrated her joy. Brahmjot Kaur Alternative rock legends Fall Out Boy are onstage performing their updated version of Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\" in unusually boxy fits. The song blasts some of the most iconic moments of the last 30 years. The 20-plus-year veterans are back on stage for the first time since 2007, when we all remember bassist Pete Wentz in his guyliner and tight jeans. The emos (including me) can\u2019t handle it. Daysia Tolentino After a big night for both artists, Karol G and Shakira snagged a Moon Man for their song \"TQG.\" This is Karol G's first VMAs. She got the crowd on their feet earlier in the night with her performance of \"T\u00e1 OK\" and \"OKI DOKI.\" Earlier, Shakira was honored with the Video Vanguard Award. Doha Madani I love Fall Out Boy, but if you wanna talk about millennial triggers, this song is reminding me of AP U.S. History in the worst ways. Chloe Melas The entire music industry is happening over the course of 12 hours ... but actually four. Kaetlyn Liddy Nicki Minaj won her first VMA of the evening in the best hip-hop category for \"Super Freaky Girl.\" If anyone was expecting Minaj to \"emcee\" tonight, they're probably wondering where she's been. Her emcee duties may have been light so far, but she is going home with some hardware. Saba Hamedy We knew the show may go over but ... this is definitely a longer evening than we thought. Daysia Tolentino And she doesn't appreciate them! Introducing the Stray Kids' performance, Saweetie acknowledged her pre-show pink carpet slip-ups \u2014 and the internet's reactions to them. \"Y'all better stop making my last video go viral,\" she said. \"I see what you're doing. Anyways, let's try it again.\" Uwa Ede-Osifo Nigerian artist Rema won best Afrobeats for his remixed single \u201cCalm Down\u201d with Selena Gomez, which also surpassed a billion streams on Spotify this weekend. \"This means so much seeing Afrobeats grow this big,\" Rema said. \"I will not forget to shout out the people who opened the doors to me. Shout out to Fela, who started Afrobeats in the first place,\" he added, referring to Fela Kuti, among contemporary stars including Burna Boy, Don Jazzy and Wizkid. Gomez also took stage, thanking Rema for allowing her to be a part of the record. Afrobeats has had an international fan base for a while (\u201cAfrica to the World!\u201d). The musical genre fuses sounds of dancehall, African percussion, hip-hop and other acoustic art forms.  The VMAs added a best Afrobeats category this year after the Grammys and the American Music Awards announced similar awards in recognition of African musicians. About time! Brahmjot Kaur There appear to be more than 10 categories left tonight ... and more performances on deck. But only about 30 minutes left of the show. The fast-paced performances and quick transitions couldn't seem to save the show from probably going over. Uwa Ede-Osifo Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was honored with the global icon award. \u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d he said while accepting the award. \u201cI grew up watching MTV like \u2018Man I wish I could be up there.\u2019 The mogul rose to prominence in the \u201990s producing for the late Notorious B.I.G. and later built a reputation as a formidable rapper with hits including \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d (a tribute to Biggie). \"I started out as a paper boy, y\u2019all, at 12, and then I was going to be a NFL football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers,\" he said in his speech. The team \"didn\u2019t know this, but I planned on being a football player; then my leg got broke.\" Later in life, he said, people would see him dancing in New York City and cast him for videos. \"That\u2019s how I fell in love with the music industry,\" he said, thanking industry executives, songwriters and the Bad Boy family. Mary J. Blige introduced the accolade, crediting Diddy with launching her own career. \u201cHe is an incredible triumph. And nobody deserves to be called an icon more than this man.\u201d Saba Hamedy It\u2019s a family affair. One of Diddy's daughters, Chance, helped introduce the artist as he received his global icon award. Chloe Melas Sean \"Diddy\" Combs took the stage to perform hits like \"I'll Be Missing You,\" one of his most popular hits from 1997, which is a reworking of the popular 1983 hit \"Every Breath You Take\" by the Police. But that was just the beginning of his epic performance. Combs, who is being honored with the global icon award, also sang \"Bad Boy for Life\" and \"I Need a Girl Pt 2,\" just to name a few. He also brought out fellow artists like Keyshia Cole to perform \"Last Night.\" This is bringing me back! Doha Madani Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift posed for a sweet photo together tonight, both looking unbelievable, I have to say. These two are proof that boyfriends may come and go but a best friend is forever. They met when they started dating Jonas brothers as teenagers and have stuck together ever since. Also, someone give Gomez's new stylist her flowers, because she is just stunning left and right lately. Uwa Ede-Osifo The neck-breaking speed at which the performances and presenters were moving earlier in the night seems to be slowing down to a more sustainable pace, thankfully! The highlight of the night has been the camaraderie and love among all the stars. And of course, the musicians, as always, have had stunning dance ensembles choreographed to a T. So far, no mind-altering moments or provocative incidents have occurred. But the night is still young! Neither *NSYNC nor the storied hip-hop pioneers have taken the stage yet, so we shall see ... Doha Madani Anitta, a beloved Brazilian artist, just beat out Bad Bunny, Shakira and Karol G for the best Latin award. \"I want to thank myself, because I work so hard, oh, my God,\" she said. Earlier in the evening, she joked that she was hoping to take the moon person statue back with her to Brazil, because she keeps her first VMA award in her Miami house. Daysia Tolentino In anticipation of the release of \"Pink Friday 2\" in November, the rapper performed her latest single off the album \"Last Time I Saw You\" and debuted a new song. Chloe Melas Before he introduced Nicki Minaj's performance, Billy Porter turned around to give a shoutout to Taylor Swift, who was seated behind him. He said he owes Swift for helping him receive his very own moon man when he starred in her music video for \"You Need to Calm Down\" in 2019. Porter is a #swiftie just like us. He also congratulated Shakira on her award. Brahmjot Kaur Shakira is taking home the MTV Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award after she performed a career-spanning medley of her greatest hits \u2014 a tradition for the award's recipients. The award is presented \"in recognition of an artist's overall achievements in music and film but is sometimes handed out as a lifetime achievement award,\" according to MTV. \"Thank you, MTV, for being part of my career since I was 18 years old,\" Shakira said in her acceptance speech. She also thanked her creative partners who helped bring her music videos to life and her kids, whom she brought to the show. Shakira, who performed at the VMAs for the first time in 14 years, is the first South American and the second Latina to win the award. The Colombian pop star sold 95 million records worldwide, making her the best-selling artist of all time. She also won numerous awards, including four Moon Persons, three Grammys, 12 Latin Grammys and 41 Billboard Latin Music Awards. Chloe Melas Shakira is putting on a 10-minute show-stopping performance featuring a medley of her greatest hits. But viewers of the VMAs on social media began to wonder whether she is lip syncing. It's not uncommon for artists who have extreme dance routines to sing to a track. Regardless, Shakira is a musical queen. Her hips don't lie, and we love her for it. Saba Hamedy Can you type and dance at the same time? Asking for a friend. Daysia Tolentino The VMAs has struggled to find its footing in recent years, and it's becoming very apparent as the night goes on that it is relying very heavily on our collective nostalgia for the show. However, an overreliance of nostalgia lends to a dearth of original culture. It's no wonder the VMAs lacks those iconic cultural moments these days \u2014 it is looking s much into the past that it is unable to drive culture into the future! Uwa Ede-Osifo If one thing can be taken away from Doja Cat's music, it's that the star is unapologetic about doing whatever she wants. She performed the single \"Attention\" off her forthcoming album with lyrics alluding to the pressures of being in the public eye (\"Look at me/ Look at me / You lookin'?\") Her dancers were covered in red paint, a nod to the title of her album, \"Scarlet.\" Plus Ice Spice gave a cute shoutout to Doja Cat before she went onstage, plugging that she will be joining the pop star on her latest tour! Brahmjot Kaur Nostalgic or cheugy? The 2000s icons presenting awards is starting to feel a little forced and dare I say \u2014 a little cheugy. (Sorry to Ashanti.) Daysia Tolentino SZA's \"Shirt\" snagged the award for best R&B, but the singer wasn't present to accept the moon statue. Doha Madani French Montana, a Moroccan American, announced he'll be creating an emergency fund for victims of the earthquake in Morocco. \"Before we get to the nominees, I want to spread some love and light to Morocco. They\u2019ve been hit with a big earthquake,\" he said. \"I\u2019m setting up our emergency fund with globalcitizen.org/morocco, and I will be donating myself.\" More than 2,900 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the North African country this weekend. Kaetlyn Liddy Taylor Swift wins her second VMA of the night for \"Anti-Hero.\" For those counting, that\u2019s 2/11. She gave a shoutout to her producer, Jack Antonoff, and their first collaboration together, \"1989,\" in her acceptance speech. \"We'll be making music together until 2089,\" she said. Saba Hamedy About 45 minutes into the show and most of the NBC team live blogging agrees: How can there be any memorable moments if the show is going so fast? As Uwa said on Slack, \"it seems like its scheduled by the second.\" Added Kaetlyn, \"This pace is for the TikTok generation.\" Angela Yang Stray Kids took home the best K-Pop award for its single \u201cS-Class.\" \u201cWe\u2019ve been making music ever since the start of our career, but to receive this award just really means a lot to us,\u201d Bang Chan said. This is the group\u2019s first-ever VMA win, making it a big moment for members Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin and I.N. \u201cWe really want to dedicate that award to the fans, as well,\u201d Bang Chan said on the carpet ahead of the show. Kaetlyn Liddy I love that the VMAs are celebrating so many different genres of music, but these quick transitions are giving me whiplash. We moved on very quickly from Cardi B to Demi ... give her some applause! Daysia Tolentino Lovato has been returning to her pop-rock roots in recent years, and she performed rock versions of her three biggest hits at the VMAs. The crowd went wild as she performed \"Heart Attack,\" \"Sorry Not Sorry\" and \"Cool for the Summer.\" All three songs will be in her coming album \"Revamped,\" featuring 10 rock versions of her old songs. We need the rerecording of \"La La Land\" now. Or another \"Camp Rock\" film. Uwa Ede-Osifo When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion are on a track together, trust that it will be a song to remember. The pair, who previously put out the provocative hit \"WAP,\" performed their latest collaboration, \"Bongos,\" with a tropical dance number in suit. Saba Hamedy Editor's note: Please excuse us in advance if the live blog goes dark at some point during the show. If and when *NSYNC performs, the team will likely have passed out. If our bosses are reading this, we're kidding. Doha Madani Taylor Swift won the VMA for the best pop video. Honestly, how deserved. This was a jampacked category with some stiff competition, but this was a much-talked-about hit. \"I'm not doing well pivoting from this to this,\" she said while accepting the award from *NSYNC. \"I had your dolls. Are you doing something? What's going to happen now? They're going to do something, and I need to know what it is. You're pop personified \u2014 to receive this from your golden pop hands is really, it's too much.\" She thanked the band for giving her friendship bracelets as she got onstage. Doha Madani Taylor Swift was screaming over *NSYNC; she's just like me for real. Angela Yang ICYMI: Wondering if it was intentional that the camera panned to Taylor Swift applauding as soon as Nicki Minaj mentioned Olivia? Doha Madani It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie. All five members *NSYNC have come together for the first time since 2013, when Justin Timberlake was honored with the VMAs Vanguard Award. Timberlake was joined onstage tonight by Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez and Joey Fatone. And mine at home because they are tearin' up my little millennial heart. It's been rumored that the men are making new music together for Universal Pictures' coming \"Trolls Band Together\" film. Uwa Ede-Osifo Part of the beauty of the VMAs is its unpredictability. Who would've thought a performance by Lil Wayne would be followed by Olivia Rodrigo? Whiplash or an interesting blend of past and present stars? Daysia Tolentino Hot off the release of her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" Rodrigo performed the lead single, \"vampire,\" during the opening performance of the VMAs. And those seemingly technical glitches? Not to worry \u2014 all a part of the show. Rodrigo re-created the stage issues from the \"vampire\" music video before she transitioned to the new fan favorite \"get him back!\" off \"Guts.\" Doha Madani My girl Slaylor Swift, the most nominated artist of the night, is officially in the house. But her arrival was announced at the very end of the pre-show, so we didn't get any interview moments, but Swift did show off her look on the pink carpet. In all black, I have to wonder whether she's re-entering her \"reputation\" era. Uwa Ede-Osifo The legendary rapper Lil Wayne knows how to put on a show. Tunechi had the audience on their feet, waving their hands in the air to an energetic rendition of his single \"Uproar,\" followed by a performance of \"Kat Food.\" Angela Yang The VMAs are officially kicking off after a dazzling performance from Sabrina Carpenter during the pre-show. So far, Tomorrow X Together and Dove Cameron have already taken home awards for push performance and video for good, respectively. Daysia Tolentino The singer brought her signature wit to the pre-show with a custom outro to \"Nonsense\" in honor of the VMAs. \"He say it bigger than a Moon Man / Guess that means I'm holding it with two hands / VMAs, I love you / I\u2019m a huge fan,\u201d she sang. Real fans know she has a new outro for every occasion, and the VMAs are no different! Kaetlyn Liddy Dove Cameron's \"Breakfast\" took home the moon person for video for good. \u201cTelling meaningful messages in my music and in my videos is super important to me,\" Cameron said in her acceptance speech. The video's concept, she previously told \"TODAY,\" was a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. \"It\u2019s unfair for one gender to carry the entirety of the weight of the reproductive conversation,\" she said. In the music video, she and other women harass a male employee who is later shown getting an abortion. At the end, footage from marches is played in support of reproductive rights. Daysia Tolentino Viewers can choose among the top three nominees for best new artist using a Snapchat filter. The filter is called \"Best New Artist Lens,\" and users can cast their votes by gesturing 1, 2 or 3 with their fingers. The race for best new artist has narrowed to three contenders: Ice Spice, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Peso Pluma. Viewers can also vote on the VMAs website. Kaetlyn Liddy I love that the VMAs say they are \"music's most iconic night.\" Not the most important, but definitely the most iconic. Angela Yang Kelsea Ballerini is celebrating her birthday at the VMAs this year. The country singer said she's celebrating her 30th at the awards show. \"I\u2019m overstimulated in every way,\" she said during the pre-show carpet interview. \"But you know, listen, just to be able to perform on an all-genre show like this and represent country music hopefully well.\" She said she's excited to be at the show with her boyfriend, Chase Stokes, and her mom. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s been such a huge year in my personal life and my career, and I feel really happy to be able to just present that tonight on this show.\" Doha Madani Tonight's proving that artists are fans just like us. During the carpet pre-show, Karol G and Anitta expressed kind words for Shakira, whose Latin representation meant so much to them. Karol G, a fellow Colombian, is nominated with Shakira for the best Latin award, while Anitta is competing against them both. \"I think Shakira for us was a big, big influence ... to make us believe that it's possible being a Latina and getting here and showing our culture and everything,\" Anitta said during the pre-show. Personally, Shakira means a lot to me, too, as the daughter of Lebanese immigrants. My parents always pointed to her half-Lebanese heritage for an example for us in mainstream media. Brahmjot Kaur During her pre-show interview, Shakira teased her performance that will encompass her decadeslong career. \"I think it's a pretty dynamic performance. I hope it's not too long,\" she said. The Colombian pop star also shared her experience envisioning and creating her larger-than-life music videos. \"Videos are a way to express whatever I couldn't finish expressing with my lyrics. Visuals are so powerful,\" she said. Shakira might worry the performance will be too long, but I think we'll all love it too much to think about the duration. Saba Hamedy Tiffany Haddish promoted her song \u201cTill The Club Closes\u201d (with Lil Jon & Fivio Foreign) during her VMAs carpet appearance. \"I've been taking my savings and putting into the things I love,\" she said. \"'I've been creating all this really great music.\" She joked that the last time she partied until the club closed was four days ago, when she maybe took a nap in the club.  I'd do the same. Daysia Tolentino Is it us, or does it feel like everyone doing interviews on the carpet seems excited to be at the VMAs because they grew up watching it? Angela Yang Tomorrow X Together is the first to receive a VMA tonight, winning Push performance of the year for its song \u201cSugar Rush Ride.\u201d It's the South Korean boy band's first ever VMA win. \u201cTonight is a night we will remember forever. Thank you VMAs,\u201d Huening Kai said. The group will debut its new song \u201cBack for More\u201d with Anitta later. Daysia Tolentino During a pre-show interview, Cardi B said \u201chip-hop is everything\" to her. She gave a shoutout to her hometown, the Bronx, the birthplace of the genre. Tonight, there will be a celebratory performance commemorating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. Cardi B also shared her appreciation for \"Bongos\" collaborator Megan Thee Stallion. \"We work so great together. She's hard-working. I'm hard-working. ... She trusts me, and I trust her,\" she said of their friendship. The two rappers are also expected to perform their new single tonight.  Brahmjot Kaur Is tonight going to be a nostalgia fest? It already feels like the VMAs are leaning into (and possibly relying on?) nostalgia by previewing this hip-hop tribute and having Nelly perform alongside NLE Choppa. Brahmjot Kaur Saweetie says her pink look, featuring a bone (?), is \u201cfresh off the runway.\u201d The inspiration is \u201ccaveman days\u201d or \u201cfashion when it first started.\u201d She kind of looks like the yassification of \"The Flintstones,\" and we're here for it. Saba Hamedy Not us gasping at Nelly performing \"Hot In Herre.\" This millennial is feeling nostalgic. Daysia Tolentino Megan Thee Stallion is bringing hot girl energy in a custom Brandon Blackwood corset dress at the VMAs red carpet. The rapper will be performing her new single \"Bongos,\" featuring Cardi B, later tonight. Doha Madani The pre-show has officially begun! Hosted by Saweetie, the pre-show will actually reveal the night\u2019s first big winners in addition to interviews as stars begin to arrive on the pink carpet. Saba Hamedy Beloved boy band *NSYNC is rumored to be reuniting at the VMAs. Fans are convinced that the group is dropping a new song for the third installment of the \"Trolls\" franchise and could be headed to the MTV awards show to promote it. Justin Timberlake, the band's front-runner, has voiced Branch in the films. The film's trailer teased a storyline about a boy band called \u201cBrozone\" getting back together. (\u201cTrolls Band Together\u201d is distributed by Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation. NBC News and Universal Pictures are both owned by NBCUniversal). We hope they don't tear up our hearts and that this rumor is true. Doha Madani Karol G showed up at the pink carpet with pink hair and an outfit I'm extremely jealous of. Karol, who is nominated for the best Latin category tonight, showed up with a sheer gown and a matching coat that honestly looks really comfortable. The Colombian superstar just absolutely kills in this look. Although she's competing against Bad Bunny and her collaborator Shakira, Karol G is a real contender tonight. Earlier this summer she broke a \"TODAY\" record by drawing more than 15,000 people to the plaza for the Citi Concert Series. Angela Yang Olivia Rodrigo turned heads on the pink carpet with her sparkly outfit. The pop star has made a lot of headlines lately with the release of her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" and fan speculation surrounding who lyrics from some of the songs are about. Many online continue to speculate that the \"Driver's License\" singer has a feud with Taylor Swift. The prolific female artists are up in several of the same categories this year \u2014 at a time when fans of both artists are relentlessly fanning the speculative flames. In 2021, Rodrigo raved about meeting Swift in person. Swift also sent Rodrigo a special gift. But after the release of her first album, \u201cSour,\u201d fans sensed a vibe shift. Rodrigo ended up giving Swift and Jack Antonoff co-writing credits on her songs \u201c1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\u201d and \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d for which Rodrigo said she took inspiration from Swift\u2019s \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d and \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d respectively. Since that first album\u2019s release, Rodrigo has appeared to express less public adoration for Swift in social media posts. In June, Rodrigo\u2019s single \u201cVampire\u201d prompted some to theorize that the song was inspired by Swift and the music industry. Asked about it by The Guardian, Rodrigo said she was \u201csurprised\u201d people thought it was about Swift. In an interview with Rolling Stone published today, Rodrigo finally addressed the rumors directly. \u201cI don\u2019t have beef with anyone. I\u2019m very chill. I keep to myself.\u201d Saba Hamedy It's a big year for Combs at the VMAs. The artist will receive the third-ever Global Icon Award, which MTV says \"celebrates an artist or band whose unparalleled career and continued influence have achieved a unique level of global success in music and beyond.\" Past recipients are Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Combs, who is also nominated for four other awards, will also perform. NBC News Yesterday, the New York Post published this hot take: \"Why the MTV VMAs \u2014 once the hottest awards show around \u2014 don\u2019t matter anymore.\" We, the NBC News team live blogging tonight, had some thoughts. Doha: The VMAs are a casualty of a larger issue of awards shows slowly losing social relevance, either because they\u2019re too polished or because social media makes celebrities less reliant on traditional platforms to make news. Even still, the VMAs are the most enjoyable show in the genre and the show most focused on fans. Kaetlyn: It\u2019s true that the VMAs might not \u201cmatter\u201d as much as other awards shows, but that is exactly what makes them fun to watch. The VMAs don\u2019t have the gravity of the Oscars or the Grammys. It\u2019s not the biggest night in any industry, but that sets the celebs free in a way. Brahmjot: I think the awards and categories themselves are unmemorable, but the VMAs have always been a pop culture gold mine for viewers to ogle, reminisce about and cringe at. Angela: As MTV grows ever further removed from the way we consume music, I hope artists will take the VMAs as an opportunity to experiment more with live appearances even in the age of streaming. Daysia: Once considered the night for iconic pop cultural moments, the VMAs are kind of in their flop era. When was the last time that the show truly delivered a provocative, dominating cultural moment? While it continues to provide solid live performances and has spawned a couple of memes in recent years, the awards show is losing touch with the culture. The issue could be that we\u2019ve seen it all. Doha Madani We can\u2019t talk about jaw-dropping VMA moments without recounting Miley Cyrus\u2019 2013 performance of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d with Robin Thicke. Cyrus was in only a pair of latex underwear at one point during the song, thrusting against a foam finger between her legs and later twerking against Thicke\u2019s crotch. The scene was quite a scandal, and it was discussed in interviews for years. Cyrus was only two years out from the end of her Disney Channel show, \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d and people seemed to take some issue with her dramatic change in image. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Cyrus argued that no one seemed to take issue with Thicke even though he was well aware of the performance. \u201cI\u2019ve just always been a very open person ... so I\u2019ve tried to wrap my head around what a normal person thinks of the performance, and I can\u2019t really understand where the shock comes from,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cI know that sounds crazy, but ... I don\u2019t see anything more than what any other artist did that night.\u201d Thicke told Oprah Winfrey that things can sometimes appear different during rehearsal and that the performance seemed more silly than sexual to him at the time. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just not as normal as I thought I was,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offended by it personally, because I think some see that and they go, \u2018This is so sexual.\u2019 And to me, I\u2019m sitting there going: \u2018This is whacky. This is funny to me.\u2019\u201d Doha Madani Awards shows are best remembered for their unscripted moments, including the 2000 VMAs, where a rockstar got arrested. Rage Against the Machine was nominated for best rock video but ultimately lost to Limp Bizkit\u2019s \u201cBreak Stuff.\u201d As Limp Bizkit tried to accept the award, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed the scaffolding and sat on top of a large sculpture onstage. No one had any clue what was going on, though members of Limp Bizkit encouraged him to jump off the sculpture. Toni Braxton and 98 Degrees stood dumbfounded as they went on to present the next award, and security was trying to get Commerford down. Eventually Commerford was gotten down and arrested. Bandmate Tom Morello told Rolling Stone at the time that he felt police overreacted but that he believes Commerford was mistaken for a crazed fan. In reality, he just didn\u2019t like Limp Bizkit. Commerford told Rolling Stone in 2015 that he had only one regret. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve swung on that thing and brought it to the ground and just destroyed it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could do it all over again, I would\u2019ve ripped that thing to the ground and shredded it.\u201d Doha Madani There\u2019s absolutely no argument that the most memorable VMA moment in history is the kiss heard \u2019round the world. At the 2003 awards show, Madonna performed a mashup of her songs \u201cLike A Virgin\u201d and \u201cHollywood\u201d with pop sensations Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. At the very end, Madonna turned to Spears and kissed her before she turned to lay her lips on Aguilera, as well.  Many people forget that Aguilera was also a part of the kiss, maybe because Spears got the shock value of being first. Either way, this is one image seared into pop culture history.  Doha Madani Lady Gaga, she\u2019s got the meat. Lady Gaga offered the world one of the most bizarre red carpet looks in fashion history at the 2010 VMAs. Gaga arrived in a dress covered in meat. Yes, actual raw meat. Gaga recounted the look in an interview with British Vogue in 2021, explaining that the dress was actually a corset that had meat sewn into it. The outfit was a protest of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d a military policy that discriminated against queer service members and was ultimately repealed in 2011. \u201cWe decided to do the meat dress because I thought to myself if you\u2019re willing to die for your country, what does it matter how you identify?\u201d Gaga said. Onstage, Gaga announced the name of her coming album, \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d and sang a snippet from the title track. \u201cHow beautiful in my way, because God makes no mistakes. I\u2019m on the right track, baby, I was born this way,\u201d she sang in the dress. Doha Madani The VMAs may only be an elder millennial, but the awards ceremony has some iconic pop culture moments that we won't forget. As NBC News' chief Swiftie, I can tell you all about one uncomfortable September night in 2009 with great detail, but I'll spare you every detail. Taylor Swift had just won best female video for \"You Belong With Me,\" her first VMA win, when Ye jumped onstage. Ye, the artist formally known as Kanye West, grabbed the mic from Swift as she was giving her thank you speech. \"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you,\" he said. \"Imma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time.\" People booed. Beyonc\u00e9 looked visibly uncomfortable. And Swift was devastated. Beyonc\u00e9 went on to win the video of the year award and offered her time to Swift, who returned to a standing ovation. Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift never appeared to have any bad blood between them following the incident, though the same can't be said for Swift and Ye. The moment unwittingly opened a series of events that included a presidential dis, two \u201cSNL\u201d monologues, a naked wax figure of Swift, an edited phone call clip, an online fan war and an album dedicated to Swift's reputation (which she'll be re-recording soon). But I'm not going to talk about that in my blog post! La la la la la! Saba Hamedy Read more about the star-studded list of performers and nominations on Today.com. Saba Hamedy Shakira is being honored with the Video Vanguard Award. She will also perform at the awards show for the first time since 2006. We expect, per usual, that her hips won't lie. But looks like she's got a lot more in store, per an Instagram post from last week in which she shared: \"POV when you\u2019re trying to cram an entire career into one #VMAs Vanguard performance.\" Saba Hamedy Saba Hamedy Here are the 11 categories the Eras Tour queen is nominated for: Chloe Melas Technically, no one is \"hosting\" the VMAs this year. But Nicki Minaj is emceeing, as she did last year. \u201cMinaj will announce the show\u2019s star-studded lineup of performers, presenters and winners,\" MTV said in a news release. If that sounds like a hosting gig, that's because it kind of is, without the title. According to a source at MTV familiar with the awards show, no one can labeled as a \"host\" because of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Saba Hamedy The ceremony will air live at 8 p.m. ET on MTV in more than 150 million countries. For those of you who can't get enough of the celebs, the pre-show starts at 6:30 p.m. ET, and our live blog kicks off at 4 p.m. ",

        "title": "Why family vlogger Ruby Franke's downfall has become such a spectacle ",
        "content": "A virtual preliminary hearing for Ruby Franke \u2014 the family vlogger charged with six counts of felony child abuse \u2014 turned into a viral spectacle Friday after more than 1,000 people tried to join the livestream and dozens of people flocked to TikTok and YouTube to share video livestreams, recaps and analysis. It\u2019s become the latest legal case \u2014 joining Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s ski crash trial and the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial \u2014  to captivate audiences online and inspire a flurry of nonexpert takes across social media. On TikTok, the hashtag #rubyfranke saw 3,000 posts and more than 300 million views in the last seven days. Search interest in Franke also spiked on YouTube the day of the hearing, according to Google Trends. While Franke\u2019s not an A-list celebrity, her hearing drew attention from those curious to witness the dramatic fall of a once-popular YouTuber, as well as those outraged that a \u201cmomfluencer\u201d who built a following touting her parenting online is now in a jumpsuit for allegedly abusing her own children. The intense irony of this case, some commentators say, is bringing renewed attention to a dark underside of family vlogging channels. In recent months, a growing chorus of voices online have spoken out about the dangers of \u201csharenting,\u201d or when content creators share their children\u2019s lives on social media for profit. In August, Illinois passed the country\u2019s first law protecting child influencers. Advocates are hoping other states will follow. The Utah-based Franke grew an audience of over 2.5 million viewers with her now-removed family channel \u201c8 Passengers,\u201d which she launched in 2015 with her husband, Kevin. It featured their six children. She frequently collaborated on controversial parenting and relationship advice videos with Jodi Hildebrandt and her life coaching service, ConneXions.  Franke and Hildebrandt were arrested on Aug. 30 and were each charged with six counts of felony child abuse by the Washington County Attorney\u2019s Office. The arrest came after law enforcement found one of Franke\u2019s children with open wounds after escaping from Hildebrandt\u2019s home. One of Franke\u2019s other children was found in similar malnourished condition at Hildebrandt\u2019s home. Four of the six children are minors, who have now been placed under Utah\u2019s Division of Child and Family Services. Attorneys for Hildebrandt and Franke did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \u201cThe fact that she [Franke] went from this high peak of being YouTube-famous and being this quote-unquote parenting guru, going from that extreme to the extreme allegations of aggravated child abuse \u2026 and then seeing her in her jumpsuit in prison,\u201d said Bonnie King, a TikTok and YouTube commentator who focuses on true crime and family vlogging content. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an extreme fall from where she was online. I think that draws a lot of people\u2019s fascination with the case.\u201d King tried and failed to join the live hearing herself \u2014 so she followed along by joining the livestream of a YouTuber who gave verbal updates on what he was hearing from the virtual courtroom. She then made her own viral TikTok video commenting on what happened. Laurel Cook, a social marketing researcher and associate professor at West Virginia University, said the shocking nature of Franke\u2019s case is pushing the wider public to be more skeptical of parents who profit from using their children for content. \u201cWhat\u2019s really a silver lining in all this is that a lot of people are putting in free hours as quote-unquote internet sleuths and bringing new attention to a lot of the content Ruby has already provided freely,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo now all of us, including myself, are rewatching this content with a new perspective. And that\u2019s making us even more shocked in light of the recent allegations.\u201d Now all of us, including myself, are rewatching this content with a new perspective. And that\u2019s making us even more shocked in light of the recent allegations. -LAUREL COOK, A SOCIAL MARKETING RESEARCHER AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY Many commentators online noted that child influencers don\u2019t have the same rights and regulations that child actors typically do. \u201cA lot of people not only are recognizing the importance of this and how this needs to take precedence because these kids are the pioneers of a new form of cruelty against children in the child labor industry,\u201d said YouTube commentator Tezzmosis, who prefers to go by his social media handle to keep his full identity private. Tezzmosis relayed information from the hearing in a live commentary video, which amassed a modest following of several hundred viewers at a time throughout the three-hour stream.  He said he believes much of the public interest in the case comes from the clear disconnect it illustrates between the \u201cperfect image\u201d a parenting influencer can present online versus their family\u2019s reality behind the scenes. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on [authorities\u2019] radar for a couple of years,\u201d he said, referring to the news that police had previously received and responded to reports made about Franke\u2019s alleged treatment of her children.   \u201cBut being from an affluent family and having this notoriety in such a way, I think it was so hard for people to believe that something so bad could be going on beyond the surface,\u201d Tezzmosis added.  Both King and Tezzmosis said they plan to continue their social media coverage of Franke\u2019s court appearances to the best of their ability, whether by attending the hearings themselves or following along with updates from news sources. A judge ruled last week that Franke and Hildebrandt will continue to be held without bail until their next scheduled court appearance on Sept. 21.

        "title": "How big-name concerts became unlikely places for immigrant parents and kids to bond",
        "content": "Maha Hashwi, 25, has loved Taylor Swift for almost half her life. From her early-2000s heartbreak hits to the phenom she\u2019s now become, the pop icon has become a family affair for Hashwi and her mom, who is a Lebanese immigrant.  \u201cI would explain to her on long car rides everything about Taylor Swift\u2019s life,\u201d she said. In August, a decade-plus of Swiftie education culminated in the two traveling from Michigan to Los Angeles to watch Swift perform live at her worldwide Eras Tour. Her mom was in awe, Hashwi said, and the experience brought them closer in ways she didn\u2019t anticipate.  Hashwi and her mom are among the countless pairs of kids and their immigrant parents who have long found concerts to be an arena that transcends culture and differences, providing a way to bond, share interests and find a common language of sorts. With a number of big-name concerts underway like The Jonas Brothers Tour, many children of immigrants have been reminiscing about the memorable shows, from Beyonc\u00e9 to the Spice Girls to Taylor Swift, that have bridged divides across generations.  \u201cWhen I learn lyrics in Arabic, it helps me feel closer to her and just being Lebanese,\u201d Hashwi said. \u201cAnd I think when we play our English, American music to our parents, it also helps them understand us.\u201d Chelsea Page, a 26-year-old based in Los Angeles, said that the music, powerfully blared over the speakers, has the ability to speak to all regardless of language skills. Page, who attended Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance tour a week ago, said she watched as her mother, a Filipino immigrant, danced the night away in a shimmery metallic top and screamed the lyrics of \u201cFormation\u201d and other hits.   \u201cMy mom is a little bit more reserved, English is not her first language and she and I are very different personality-wise,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe intensity of her production for this really allowed us to \u2026 resign ourselves to everything that Beyonc\u00e9 was saying, and feeling empowered and celebrating life.\u201d Page added that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s universal messages and social commentary on feminism holds significance across borders and oceans. For her and her mother, it made the experience all the more powerful with both unapologetically celebrating their womanhoods.  For more from NBC Asian America, sign up for our weekly newsletter. \u201cIt\u2019s also very much a social thing and the influence of Beyonc\u00e9 to kind of create that space where we\u2019re allowed to let loose, have so much fun and just fully embrace the female experience and recognize there\u2019s pain that comes with it,\u201d Page said. \u201cBut we can still be powerful on our own terms, and we can celebrate that in and of itself.\u201d The concert outing tradition runs deep. And for many, it's a way for immigrant families to celebrate their established lives in the U.S. with their kids, Katie Nguyen, a 33-year-old based in Los Angeles, said. Nguyen, whose father took her to see the Spice Girls and Britney Spears more than two decades ago when she was a child, said that he accompanied her, not just as a favor to her. Nguyen recounted seeing her dad, a Vietnamese refugee who was normally a more introverted guy, dancing to the music, with a smile spread across his face at the sight of his daughter having the time of her life.  \u201cIt was part of his immigrant experience. I don\u2019t know if he had a chance to do this when he was in Vietnam. It was almost like, \u2018Now I\u2019m in America. I get to do this for the first time alongside my daughter,\u2019\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about him being the chaperone.\u201d  For immigrant dads who might not often express affection verbally, music has long been a medium to show that they cared. Stefanie Ricchio, 43, says her dad, who was a lower-income Italian immigrant, didn\u2019t have the time or means to take his kids to shows.  \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a reality for us,\u201d Ricchio said of her childhood in New Jersey. \u201cWhen you\u2019re single income, immigrant, blue-collar, it\u2019s the necessities. It was paying your mortgage, paying your utilities, keeping your car in check. And then whatever else came after.\u201d But when one of her favorite bands, New Kids on the Block, came to town in the early 90s, her father did his best to create a special experience for the family.  \u201cHe brought us to where the venue was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was kind of outside and [the band] was in this glass building. There was this moment where we could see them in the glass, and we could wave and have that connection \u2026 He saw that we were smiling and that we were giddy. And he was like, \u2018OK, are we good? Are we happy?\u2019\u201d Young millennials and older Gen Zs just getting established in their own careers say they\u2019ve been having the same experience in reverse. Athena Sobhan, 28, who is Bangladeshi American from Southern California, says she has taken her parents to shows that they never could have gone to as young people.  In 2018, after her mom completed treatment for breast cancer, Sobhan took both her parents to see Fleetwood Mac to celebrate.  \u201cI got to experience them seeing their favorite artists which was really interesting because they never got to see them at their peak,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we went to see Fleetwood Mac, my mom and I were the only ones standing and singing and screaming together.\u201d  Marin Korenaga, whose dad has enjoyed around a dozen musical performances with her, added that the venues, filled with screaming fans and the artist projected before them, almost forces immigrant parents to give into joy, escape the stresses of immigration and see their children as people. It was during these shows, Korenaga said, that her father, a normally stoic geophysicist, began to see the warmth she felt when surrounded by the music at their first show together, a 2019 Maisie Peters concert, recognizing it as a similar feeling to what he experienced as a young, aspiring geophysicist. He quickly began to advocate for her dreams of becoming a singer-songwriter herself, she said.  \u201cIt definitely opened up a more vulnerable side of me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt leads to more freedom and, like, discussion.\u201d  Juliet Izon said her dad, a documentary filmmaker who immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines, began accompanying her to Tori Amos shows, tagging along to at least five of them throughout the years. Izon said that her father, an avid musician who performed in bands all throughout her childhood, was open about his own music taste. But their Tori Amos outings were always, in part, his own effort to peek into her world. They would strike up conversations about songs or compare favorite albums \u2014 a tradition that she\u2019s passed down to her own daughter.  \u201cIt was just fun for him to see what I was into,\u201d Izon, 38, said. \u201cWhen he started bringing me to concerts \u2026 it was just a fun way to get to know each other better.\u201d  She added: \u201c[Music] can transcend generations. It can transcend time.\u201d Kim Hoyos, 27, remembers her emo phase like it was yesterday. With few friends at school that shared her changing music taste, she said her dad became her concert companion.  \u201cHe was into the rock part,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to tell me all these stories of how they would play American music in the park in his town and, when a new album came out, people would make copies and buy them or just come listen for free at the park.\u201d Her parents, both Colombian immigrants, raised her on the sounds of salsa, cumbia and merengue, but when she became a Tumblr blogger with a tendency to shop at Hot Topic, they were more than accepting of that, too. \u201cThey would venture into Hot Topic to buy T-shirts for me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad brought me to Jack\u2019s Mannequin shows. He loves the music, he doesn\u2019t know every word or anything like that, but he knows the gist.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first or the last time music would play an important role in her relationship with her parents either. Her first concert experience with them was a Hillary Duff show in New York when she was 11 years old, and her mom has since accompanied her to see Taylor Swift.  \u201cThose are just moments that I knew they would always be there for me,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Bad Bunny is 'not really interested in clarifying anything' about his life to fans",
        "content": "Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny is opening up about why he sings in Spanish \u2014 and why he\u2019s working on speaking English for some \u201cspecific people.\u201d The 29-year-old, born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, told Vanity Fair in an article published Sept. 12 he is working on his English by speaking it. \u201cWith some people, I speak English \u2014 with some specific people,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cWith one of them, I couldn\u2019t talk to her before.\u201d Mart\u00ednez did not specify whom he was referring to, and he also did not confirm or deny reports he\u2019s dating model Kendall Jenner to Vanity Fair. (The pair have been spotted on several dates over the summer, from horseback riding to attending a Drake concert, and she\u2019s also been rumored to be the subject of some of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s recent lyrics). For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter. As for singing in English, Mart\u00ednez hasn\u2019t ruled it out: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I hate the idea.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just that I feel more comfortable in my own language,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think in Spanish, I feel in Spanish, I eat in Spanish, I sing in Spanish.\u201d He added: \u201cI am never going to do it just because someone says I need to do it to reach a certain audience.\u201d When the news of Mart\u00ednez and Jenner\u2019s romance broke via a DeuxMoi tip earlier this year, his devoted fans immediately expressed backlash. Mart\u00ednez told Vanity Fair he doesn\u2019t feel committed to clarifying anything about his life to his fan base. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how you feel, they don\u2019t know how you live, they don\u2019t know anything, and I really don\u2019t want them to know. I\u2019m not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said of his fans. \u201cThere are people who say that artists have to put up with it. I don\u2019t have to accept anything and everything because I wanted to be an artist. At the end of the day, you listen to me because you want to. I don\u2019t force you to.\u201d  Following his rapid ascent to the top of the charts following his three album releases in 2020, plus his 2022 hit album, \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said he and his team temporarily relocated to Los Angeles about seven months ago. While he called living in Los Angeles forever \u201cimpossible,\u201d he said he wasn\u2019t sure about his future. When asked if he wanted traditional milestones like marriage and children, he replied, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He then clarified: \u201cNot ever, but not now.\u201d But one thing is for sure: He has been looking for \u201cthe perfect place in Puerto Rico\u201d to build his dream home \u201cfor a long time.\u201d \u201cI hope to live here forever,\u201d he said of the Caribbean island.

        "content": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher said they are \"aware of the pain\" their character letters defending convicted rapist Danny Masterson caused, stating their intent was not to re-traumatize the victims or undermine the verdict. Kunis and Kutcher were among several actors from \"That \u201970s Show\" who went to bat for Masterson before he was sentenced Thursday to 30 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting two women at his Hollywood Hills home two decades ago. \"We support victims, we have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future,\" Kunis, 40, said in an Instagram video Saturday with her husband. In letters submitted to the court, Kunis and Kutcher described Masterson as an \"outstanding older brother figure,\" a \"dedicated and loyal\" husband, and an \"excellent\" role model \u2014 a stark contrast to the predator who \"drugged and raped\" defenseless woman that his victims labeled him as. \"Throughout our time together, Danny has proven to be an amazing friend, confidant, and, above all, an outstanding older brother figure to me,\" Kunis wrote in her letter. \"His caring nature and ability to offer guidance have been instrumental in my growth both personally and professionally.\" Kunis went on to say that Masterson\u2019s role \"as a husband and father to his daughter has been nothing short of extraordinary.\" In his letter, Kutcher recalled a time when Masterson came to the defense of a woman being berated by her boyfriend and described how he helped raise money for first responders who became ill after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Kutcher also addressed the accusations against Masterson, writing that he hoped his \"testament to his character is taken into consideration in sentencing.\" \"I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society and having his daughter raised without a present father would be a tertiary injustice in and of itself,\" the actor said. Kutcher said Saturday that he and Kunis wrote the letters after Masterson's family asked them to characterize \"the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing.\" \"The letters were not written to question the legitimacy of the judicial system or the validity of the jury's ruling,\" Kunis said. \"They were intended for the judge to read,\" Kutcher added. \"And not to undermine the testimony of the victims or re-traumatize them in any way. We would never want to do that. And we're sorry if that has taken place.\" Masterson\u2019s wife, Bijou Phillips, as well as \"That \u201970s Show\" stars Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith, Masterson\u2019s brother-in-law, actor William Baldwin, and brother/sister actors Giovanni and Marissa Ribisi also wrote character letters on his behalf.

        "title": "Family vlogger Ruby Franke and business partner Jodi Hildebrandt will remain held without bail, judge says",
        "content": "Family vlogger Ruby Franke and her business partner Jodi Hildebrandt will continue to be held without bail until their next scheduled court appearance, Judge Eric Gentry said during a virtual hearing on Friday.  Franke and Hildebrandt were each charged with six counts of felony child abuse by the Washington County Attorney\u2019s Office last week. Each count carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years and a fine of up to $10,000. The two were arrested on Aug. 30 after law enforcement found Franke\u2019s emaciated 12-year-old son with open wounds and duct tape on his ankles and wrists after he had escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s home. Franke\u2019s 10-year-old daughter was found in similar malnourished condition at Hildebrandt\u2019s home.  Multiple outlets reported that the livestream of the hearing, held in St. George, experienced technical difficulties after over 1,000 people \u2014 including NBC News \u2014 tried to watch. The start time of the hearing was ultimately delayed. Judge John Walton will now oversee both Franke and Hildebrandt\u2019s cases, according to Tania Mashburn, a spokesperson for the Utah State Courts. Their next hearing is scheduled for Sept. 21. Franke rose to fame in 2015 with the now-removed \u201c8 Passengers\u201d YouTube channel, which featured her, her husband, Kevin, and their six children. Four of the six children are minors, who have now been placed under Utah\u2019s Division of Child and Family Services. She frequently collaborated on parenting and relationship advice videos with Hildebrandt for ConneXions, Hildebrandt\u2019s life coaching service. The service has come under fire in the past for its extreme teachings, including rejecting children who do not abide by their beliefs. NBC News affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City reported that attorneys for Franke and Hildebrandt said they intend to file motions soon to address the decision denying them bail in the case. Douglas Terry, the attorney representing Hildebrandt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. A representative for the law office of Franke\u2019s attorney, LaMar Winward, declined to comment.  Police had visited the Franke household in September 2022 after a neighbor had called to report that Franke had left her children alone for several days to spend time with Hildebrandt. A police officer noticed the children, but they refused to answer the door, according to a police report obtained by NBC News.  Police Lt. Warren Foster previously told NBC News that authorities made several attempts to follow up on the allegations. He added that inquiries from the Department of Child and Family Services yielded no results. DCFS were also reportedly called to the Franke household in 2020.  A spokeswoman for the DCFS previously declined to comment, citing confidentiality and privacy rules. DCFS can be held accountable by an independent ombudsman who investigates child protection complaints against the agency. DCFS must also answer to a review group made up of state lawmakers, the Child Welfare Legislative Oversight Panel, which can make recommendations. Rep. Christine Watkins, a chair of the panel, said Friday that she is aware of the Franke case through news reports and is planning to follow up with DCFS with her own questions about what occurred. \u201cI had concerns when I heard about the case. Not only were neighbors calling, but older siblings were calling, too,\u201d she added. \u201cIt sounds like those kids were in pretty bad shape. And it\u2019s certainly something we have the right to call DCFS out on to know what might have gone wrong.\u201d She also questioned whether Franke\u2019s status as a well-known YouTube vlogger and the outward appearance she presented about her family may have influenced any child welfare investigations. \u201cIf someone has the resources, they can cover up, they can disguise a lot of things,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cEven when kids go to court, kids can be told not to say anything. They can be intimidated by the situation.\u201d The Daily Mail reported that Franke appeared via video from a Utah jail on Thursday for a separate hearing held in juvenile court.  Mashburn confirmed the hearing occurred, but did not confirm details from the news report, telling NBC News it \u201cwas a child welfare case and records are private.\u201d The next pretrial hearing in juvenile court is scheduled for Sept. 18, according to KSL.

The 54-year-old singer took a moment during the ceremony to pose with his two boys next to his new star. The two boys also took a photo together on the red carpet. During his speech, the \u201cVivir Mi Vida\u201d singer said he was \u201cbeside myself\u201d and \u201chumbled.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m taking it in and I\u2019m thinking about my kids and I\u2019m thinking about my friends,\u201d he said at one point, touching on how his Latin roots and those closest to him made him who he is now. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a collection of that and I\u2019m not worthy because I have so much more to do.\u201d Anthony went on to thank his fans, team and children, among others. \u201cI want to thank people who believed in me, my godson, my babies that are not babies anymore, my baby, my beautiful friends, my wife, my team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people that on a daily basis make me the man that I am.\u201d Anthony is also father to daughter Arianna and son Chase from his previous relationship with Debbie Rosado.

Beckham said he was \u201cvery starstruck\u201d when he first met Anthony 20 years ago. He said he would listen to Anthony\u2019s music on the way to his Real Madrid games. \u201cI now dress a little bit like him. I learned salsa for one man only, but please don\u2019t tell my wife,\u201d Beckham joked, referring to Victoria Beckham. \u201cBut when we met, we immediately had a special connection. I knew that I had a friend for life.\u201d Throughout Beckham\u2019s speech, Anthony was visibly emotional, wiping away tears as his good friend spoke wonders about him. \u201cOver the years our friendship has grown and Marc is family, godfather to my son, Cruz,\u201d he said, as Cruz Beckham was also in attendance. \u201cAnd someone that I love to spend time with. He is an incredible father, husband and family man and he gives so much to the people in his life.\u201d The multi-Grammy winner would go on to share videos and photos from his ceremony on his Instagram stories, writing on one photo, \u201cGracias, mi gente,\u201d which translates to \u201cthank you, my people.\u201d This story was first published on TODAY.com Liz Calvario is a reporter and editor for TODAY.com.

        "content": "Authorities were summoned last year to the Utah home of Ruby Franke, the YouTube family influencer charged with multiple counts of child abuse, after a concerned neighbor said her children had been left home alone for several days, a police report shows. The neighbor told a responding officer from the Springville Police Department she had security camera video showing Franke had been gone since Sept. 14, four days before the officer was called to the home, the report says. The neighbor and others \"immediately started telling about how the mother of the residence, Ruby Franke, will leave her children home for extended periods of time and go to St. George to spend time with her friend\" Jodi Hildebrandt, according to the report, which NBC News obtained through a public records request with the police department. The officer who wrote the report said that he noticed children inside the home but that they refused to answer the door. NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City first reported the September 911 call. Police Lt. Warren Foster said in an email Thursday that authorities made several attempts to follow up on the allegations. Efforts by the Department of Child and Family Services yielded no results, he said, and the children refused to talk to a school resource officer assigned to the case. When the officer went to the family's home, he found Franke and some of her six children outside. \"He attempted contact but they quickly ran into the house and would not answer the door or speak with us,\" Foster said. A spokeswoman for the Child and Family Services Department declined to comment, citing confidentiality and privacy rules. An assistant to Franke's lawyer declined to comment, saying in an email, \"Our firm believes it is essential to allow the legal process to take its course, and respect the privacy and rights of all parties involved.\"  Franke's eldest daughter, Shari Franke, made the 911 call last year after a neighbor reached out to her, the report says, adding that she wanted officers to make sure her siblings were safe and had food. Shari Franke did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She has said that she was \"glad justice is being served\" against her mother. \"We\u2019ve been trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this, and so glad they finally decided to step up,\u201d she said in an Instagram Story post after her mother was arrested last month. On Friday, the Washington County attorney in Utah charged Franke and Hildebrandt, who are business partners and run the family counseling and life coaching service ConneXtions together, with six counts each of felony child abuse. Each count carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years and a fine of up to $10,000. Franke rose to prominence on her family YouTube channel, \u201c8 Passengers.\u201d The channel featured Franke, her husband, Kevin, and their six children. The channel had nearly 2.3 million followers before it was removed this year. On the channel, Franke was known for her strict parenting advice. ConneXtions has been criticized for its extreme teachings, including rejecting children who do not abide by its beliefs.  In a 911 call that led to the arrests, a neighbor of Franke's told a police dispatcher that an emaciated 12-year-old boy appeared at his front door asking for help. \"He\u2019s got tape around his legs,\" the caller said, according to audio obtained by KSL. \"He\u2019s hungry and he\u2019s thirsty.\u201d Franke and Hildebrandt are expected to appear in court Friday.

        "title": "A Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet fan's reaction to his Kylie Jenner kiss made other stans cringe",
        "content": "A Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet fan account received viral criticism online this week after people suggested that several of the account\u2019s recent posts could be taking a love for the actor too far. Club Chalamet has fewer than 4,000 followers on Instagram and just over 1,600 on X, formerly Twitter. But the account, run by fan Simone Cromer, became its own trending topic after making several posts about Chalamet\u2019s public appearance with Kylie Jenner during a Beyonc\u00e9 concert Monday. The two, who have been rumored to be dating for months, were spotted kissing at the Los Angeles show.  Chalamet, a 27-year-old indie darling turned blockbuster movie star, has often been referred to as one of the many people's favorite \u201cinternet boyfriends.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for any fan base, let alone one as large as Chalamet\u2019s, to home in on their favorite celebrities' lives and share deep dives and analysis online. The news of the Jenner PDA prompted a mix of widespread disbelief, jokes and disappointment from some fans online.  Still, Club Chalamet\u2019s response \u2014 which also involved hosting a discussion that drew about 8,000 people on X \u2014 has been called out as particularly bizarre.   \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling distressed by the video, it\u2019s ok. But please take care of yourself. Step away from social media for a couple of days,\u201d Club Chalamet posted in a statement earlier this week, along with unsubstantiated claims that Jenner \u2014 referred to in several of its posts as \u201cSlurpee\u201d \u2014 had been \u201cstalking\u201d Chalamet. Some online said they were appalled by the authoritative tone behind Club Chalamet\u2019s posts, for example when the account implied that Jenner\u2019s team must have \u201ccommanded\u201d him into being seen with her. Others expressed concern over the super fan obsession with policing Chalamet\u2019s love life.  Representatives for Chalamet and Jenner did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.  The whole saga \u2014 which has been talked about across social media platforms, including in one lengthy Reddit thread \u2014 has renewed conversation online surrounding the extreme parasocial nature of some fans\u2019 relationships with their favorite celebrities. Parasocial relationships are defined as one-sided emotional investment with a celebrity or fictional character. Much of the viral ridicule has bubbled over into vitriolic mocking of the account and Cromer herself, though some of the discourse also reignited genuine questions around fan boundaries. \u201cLike why are these Timothee fans acting like they know him, and that he owes them anything? Is extremely weird and disturbing,\u201d one Reddit commenter wrote on the thread, referencing parasocial relationships. One person called the negative comments about Jenner made by Cromer misogynistic. \u201cThe internalized misogyny is too much. ... The key point is you don\u2019t know him,\u201d another Reddit commenter wrote. \u201cYou have never met him. You don\u2019t know what he is like.\u201d There were also people who compared the fan page posts to the time a fan account wrote a lengthy letter to Chris Evans expressing fans\u2019 hurt after the actor publicly revealed his relationship with Alba Baptista. Others also drew comparisons to when \u201cJelena\u201d stans made baseless assumptions about the lives and motives of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber, who split up five years ago. In an Instagram post Wednesday, Cromer referenced the conversation about parasocial relationships that\u2019s been sparked by her commentary. \u201cIt appears that the fandom has learned a new word and is applying it to me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe term is \u2018Parasocial Relationships\u2019 and people are glee at their assumption that I fall under this tag. ... Basically, the general gossip public that just heard of Club Chalamet for the first time in recent days, think I\u2019m just a possessive delusional fan of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, championing his life while he doesn\u2019t know I exist.\u201d However, she wrote, she doesn\u2019t think the label fits her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to burst your bubble, but please note that he knows of me,\u201d she wrote, detailing alleged interactions at events in the past. \u201cI\u2019m not his friend. I\u2019m not even an acquaintance friend. I\u2019m just a fan who he is very familiar with, and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d When reached for comment by NBC News, Cromer declined to comment further, citing concerns that a response to media inquiries might amplify the backlash Club Chalamet is already receiving online. \u201cI continue to be a proud fan of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet via Club Chalamet and will support him wholeheartedly for years to come,\u201d Cromer wrote in an email Wednesday. She reiterated a similar sentiment in a different Instagram post Wednesday. \u201cI said what I said and I stand behind my words,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cI also will no longer use this space to reference Timmy\u2019s current romantic life because I don\u2019t want to provide more entertainment to looky-loos who just want more reaction from me and fellow followers who post their comments.\u201d Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.
