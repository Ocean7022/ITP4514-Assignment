        "content": "The battle was between two strong contenders with South Africa playing in four World Cups and Australia lifting the trophy five times. Kolkata, India \u2013 The skies above Eden Gardens were leaden and grey, the air thick with a stifling mix of humidity, smog and the question of which team would meet India in Sunday\u2019s Cricket World Cup final. Kolkata had pulsed with vibrant colour and noise all week in the midst of concurrent festivals of Diwali, symbolising light\u2019s triumph over darkness, and Kali Puja, celebrating the victory of good against evil. Thursday\u2019s semifinal wasn\u2019t a contest of such absolutes, instead a battle between the almost-guys and the we\u2019ve-done-it-all-before guys. South Africa have played in four World Cup knockouts without clearing the final hurdle; Australia have lifted the trophy five times, more than any other nation. If intergenerational trauma exists, then logic suggests the opposite must also; this Australian team carries the belief that conquering the vagaries of tournament play is in their blood. It gives them a certain swagger and underlies their aggressive self-belief. Consider the pronouncement of their captain, Pat Cummins, on the eve of the match: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys that have been in this situation before that have won a One Day World Cup, T20 World Cup, various other tournaments in big moments. So, I think that really helps. You can draw on that in the middle of the contest.\u201d Compare that to the words of his South African counterpart, Temba Bavuma, who confessed to feeling nervous: \u201cThere\u2019s been an acknowledgement of the emotions. I don\u2019t think you can deny or run away with that, but there\u2019s also been solutions or mechanisms that have been given as to how to deal with that anxiety, if you feel that it overwhelms yourself. \u201cI think there\u2019s only two guys in this group that have gone into a semifinal, Quinton [de Kock] and David Miller, so there\u2019s not a lot of experience from all the other guys.\u201d It was admirably honest, but to openly admit to any vulnerability before a ruthless Australia is akin to slicing open your palm and shoving your hand into shark-infested waters. They only need to sense the blood. Australia\u2019s plan with bat and ball was to land the first punch and ensure it rattled teeth. They talked about it in team meetings and carried the blueprints onto the field. Bavuma had won the toss and elected to bat first under the heavy clouds on a pitch that had been under covers all morning; It was an invitation. Throughout the tournament, South Africa\u2019s batters had been a different beast when batting first, winning every match and most by enormous margins. Their only two losses came when they were forced to chase. In playing to their strength at the toss they may have unintentionally been acknowledging a weakness; a second invitation. Australia\u2019s opening bowlers didn\u2019t need a third, especially in helpful conditions, made for Mitchell Starc\u2019s dangerous swing and bounce and Josh Hazlewood\u2019s metronomic line and length, with the added kick of spicy seam movement. Under the relentless glare of the lights that crown Eden Gardens\u2019 brutalist red-and-white towers, there was no hiding from the most brutal examination below. Bavuma lasted four balls before wafting and edging Starc outside his off-stump. Quinton de Kock, playing his last game for South Africa, withstood 13 deliveries and then skied a Hazlewood ball for Cummins to take a tumbling catch. All week, trucks blaring music and crammed with locals and effigies of Kali had filled the streets around the ground, the four-armed blue-skinned goddess a blend of beauty and ferocity; the same two elements fused in Australia\u2019s twin opening attack. South Africa had averaged 49.44 in the powerplay across the tournament, but here they were suffocated, limping to 18 for 2 in the first 10 overs. The pair sent down 61 dot balls in the first 13 overs, effectively bowling 10 maidens between them. The teeth had been rattled and there were more blows to come. When Aiden Markram drove hard at Starc and a thick edge flew to a diving Dave Warner at backward point, the fielder\u2019s celebration \u2013 a gleeful jogging dance \u2013 said it all. Australia weren\u2019t sweating, they were oozing alpha pheromones, while South Africa\u2019s batters appeared to retreat into shells made of glass; all squirts, edges and defensive prods in an effort to stave off calamity. That they avoided it was thanks to a stubborn David Miller, his imperious century made more impressive by the carnage that surrounded him. Supported by a typically aggressive Heinrich Klassen, Miller dragged his side to a total of 212. In response, Australia\u2019s batting powerplay was just as devastating, the four arms of Travis Head and Warner channelling Kali\u2019s destructive power. After swiping unsuccessfully at Marco Jansen\u2019s opening delivery, Head dropped to one knee and pummelled the second over cover-point for four, all mustachioed machismo. Machis-mo, if you like. It was a tale of two power plays, with Australia dominating both. They were 72 for 2 after 10 overs and from there could sufficiently withstand the onslaught of South Africa\u2019s spinners on a ragging pitch. Keshav Maharaj, Tabraiz Shamsi and Aiden Markram provided the counterpunch and a few nervous moments with their fizzing deliveries, while Gerald Coetzee bowled with heart and heat, but the damage had already been done and Australia could afford to be\nAustralia may have lost seven wickets, it may have taken more than 47 overs, but the result had seemed a foregone conclusion long before Pat Cummins sealed the win with a boundary. Eden Gardens was South Africa\u2019s paradise lost; Kolkata, Australia\u2019s city of joy.",

        "content": "UK\u2019s Tyson Fury will fight Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Usyk in Riyadh in the first undisputed heavyweight title fight since 1999. Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk will fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 17, organisers have announced. Fury, 35 \u2013 a British citizen of Irish Traveller heritage \u2013 is the World Boxing Council (WBC) world champion, while Ukrainian Usyk, 36, holds the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Organization (WBO), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and International Boxing Organization (IBO) belts. Both have unbeaten records. Contracts were signed in September for a proposed December 23 date, although that was never confirmed and slid after Fury\u2019s near defeat to former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion Francis Ngannou in a non-title bout in Saudi Arabia on October 28. Fury was left with a swollen eye and cut on the forehead after the split-decision win over Ngannou. Britain\u2019s Lennox Lewis was the last undisputed heavyweight champion in 1999 when he defeated Evander Holyfield to win the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles. Fury will look to add to his record of 34 wins with one draw since turning professional in 2008, while Usyk has won all of his 21 professional fights. Saudi Arabia has staged several leading boxing events in recent years, including Usyk\u2019s win over Anthony Joshua in 2022.",
