When the idea of saving household energy was introduced many years ago, it could have gone so far as to calculate power bills. But busy Hongkongers must have found it tedious and time- consuming.

They would rather get the information on their mobile devices.

Indeed, various energy-saving applications - from providing information on alternative energy to spotting extraordinary items on monthly bills - are now available in the market.

On top of that, the two local power suppliers are working very hard to promote a green environment in the SAR.
