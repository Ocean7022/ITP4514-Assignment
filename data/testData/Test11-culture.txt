LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles motorist filed a lawsuit against "Succession" and "Ferris Bueller’s Day Off" star Alan Ruck on Thursday, alleging the actor caused a chain-reaction accident in Hollywood that left the motorist with severe injuries and his car totaled.

Attorneys for Horacio Vela are seeking unspecified damages against Ruck, alleging negligence by the actor, according to the seven-page complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Representatives for Ruck did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment.

The multivehicle crash, which also resulted in heavy damage to Raffallo’s Pizza, was reported around 9 p.m. on Oct. 31 near the intersection of La Brea Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. 

Los Angeles fire officials said they arrived on the scene to find a three-vehicle collision with the front end of one vehicle partly inside a small commercial building. Ambulances were requested for two people, who were not immediately identified, with a 32-year-old man transported to hospital.

According to the complaint, Vela was waiting at a red light at the intersection of La Brea Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard when his Hyundai Elantra was forcefully struck by the driver of a Rivian R1T pickup truck, who was later identified as Ruck.
