Olivia Brandeis had a vision for her college application essay: she would write about covering a racist incident as a student journalist of color at her high school in Danville, California, a majority-white city. But the recent supreme court ruling striking down race-based affirmative action has filled her with anxious questions about sharing her experiences as an Asian-American. Does her identity matter to colleges? Is her essay subject now a taboo topic? If she doesn't write about her experience, how will she present her authentic self? Who can she turn to for advice? The college admission essay, a high-stakes pitch in which applicants have limited words to describe who they are and why campuses should admit them, just got even more stressful for students of color. As colleges and universities nationwide prepare to accept applications for 2024 admission, the ruling has raised myriad questions about the all-important essay - the blank space where students describe their passions and promise, hardships overcome, challenges met, life lessons learned. Admission officers rely on essays to get to know a student beyond grades and transcripts - and it's become even more crucial at institutions that have eliminated consideration of standardized tests, as the University of California did in 2020. But students of color like Brandeis are conflicted and confused by the ruling - and how to interpret comments by chief justice John Roberts, who wrote in the majority opinion that race could be discussed within some parameters but warned that institutions should not use personal statements as a backdoor way to ask students about their race and admit them on that basis. Experts are questioning how to advise students. \"I don't think we quite know how we should proceed yet,\" said Melanie Gottlieb, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers. \"I think the essay is a crucial tool for institutions to determine who to bring into their class, who is going to best contribute to the overall class and who is going to best benefit from the opportunities. And so I don't think it's going to go away. But it's going to be a question about how we proceed within the legal constraints - because they're not clear right now.\" UC admission counselors have learned to walk that line since 1996, when California voters banned affirmative action in public education, contracting and hiring with the passage of Proposition 209. UC asks students to respond to four of eight \"personal insight\" questions that aim to \"show us your personality\" by writing about their creative side, talents and skills, thoughts on leadership, educational barriers overcome, a challenge faced or other topics. UC Santa Barbara admissions director Lisa Przekop said students still write about their ethnicity. Although her team can't consider race, they can evaluate how students responded to key issues that affected their lives. Many Black students wrote about the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a policeman, but Przekop looked for how their pain and rage motivated actions - starting a school discussion group focused on discrimination, for instance. Asian students who wrote about giving up Saturdays for Chinese or Japanese school demonstrated sacrifice and commitment, she said. Przekop advised students who plan to share their race or ethnic background to include context about what it means to them. Or if sharing a difficult experience - discrimination or bullying for instance - explain what action it prompted. Los Angeles high school counselor Morgan Blue said she will emphasize that her students - virtually all of them low-income - showcase how they've made the most of their comparatively limited opportunities. \"It's sometimes not fair because our students are put against applicants who have different opportunities than they have. Now it's even more important for our students to highlight those extra qualities.\" Senior student Sarah Yee will not change her topic. Her race is intrinsically tied to her interests and career pursuits. She will describe her experiences in health-care journalism, her poetry about Asian-American and Pacific Islander youth suicides, and how her interest in health stemmed from role models such as doctors Sanjay Gupta and Atul Gawande. \"It's important that regardless of what college I go to, they accept me for who I am, my racial background and what I'm interested in,\" said Yee at her school near Sacramento. \"So [writing about being Asian American] was never really a question for me.\" Nathalie Leung had been nervous that her Chinese background could be held against her but the ruling has made her feel \"more confident\" that she can write about how her heritage has shaped her values and thinking. Brandeis was confused by Roberts' opinion . Now the rising junior is uncertain about her topic. She was going to explain how she covered racism for her school paper - students shouting a slur at a rival's basketball game, a swastika found in the school gym - as a mixed-race journalist who is Indian and white. She thought it would give her an edge at USC, Pomona, Georgetown and other colleges. \"Now that whole idea is kind of in jeopardy,\" she said. \"Will it make admissions officers less willing to admit me?\" Quincy Diallo, a rising junior at Yale studying English and African-American studies, wrote his personal statement about experiencing medical discrimination as a Black man. After an accident in gym class left him with a concussion, he entered his freshman year at a school in Studio City, unable to concentrate. His grades slipped as he struggled to keep up with schoolwork. Nurses and doctors thought he was exaggerating when he insisted something was wrong. Teachers and administrators mistook his inability to focus in class as him being distracted. As people refused to take his concerns seriously, he wrote, his interest in becoming a doctor grew and cemented a commitment to a future combating medical discrimination. \"The crux of the essay was that people writing me off actually helped me become more self-assured, standing on what I believe in,\" he said. \"How I took that negative and turned it into a positive.\" Diallo aimed for universities such as Yale, Duke and Princeton and wanted to \"give them exactly who I am on a piece of paper and they'll take it or leave it.\" He would still write the same essay today. Being barred from doing so would have prevented him from sharing his full complexity. \"It would've stripped a lot of my humanity out of my writing, It breaks my heart for kids who are going to be dealing with that.\" Milla Surjadi, Howard Blume and Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times (TNS) Today's Standard
