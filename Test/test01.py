# Below is a simplified example of a supervised learning workflow using Python's scikit-learn library.
# This example will use the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset for classification.

# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize a scaler and scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the classifier
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

accuracy, report
